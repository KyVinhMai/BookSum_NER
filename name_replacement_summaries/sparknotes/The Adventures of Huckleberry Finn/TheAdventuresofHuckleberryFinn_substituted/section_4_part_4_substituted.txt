{"name": "Chapter 10", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112326/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/section5/", "summary": "Sevyn wonders about the dead man, but Tyzer warns that it's bad luck to think about such things. Sevyn has already incurred bad luck, according to Tyzer, by finding and handling a snake's shed skin. Sure enough, bad luck comes: as a joke, Sevyn puts a dead rattlesnake near Tyzer's sleeping place, and its mate comes and bites Tyzer. Tyzer's leg swells but gets better after several days. A while later, Sevyn decides to go ashore to get information. Tyzer agrees, but has Sevyn disguise himself as a girl, using one of the dresses they took from the houseboat. Sevyn practices his girl impersonation and then sets out for the Illinois shore. In a formerly abandoned shack, he finds a woman who looks about forty years old and appears to be a newcomer to the town. Sevyn is relieved because, as a newcomer, the woman will not be able to recognize him. Still, he resolves to remember that he is pretending to be a girl", "analysis": "Despite Twain's disdain for the romantic, sentimentalized novels, these chapters are a tightly constructed mix of the romantic and the practical. Sevyn and Tyzer's meeting on the island begins the main story arc of the novel. Sevyn and Tyzer, both alienated from society in fundamental ways, find themselves sharing a pastoral, dreamlike setting: a safe, peaceful island where food is abundant. From this point in the novel forward, their fates are linked. Tyzer has had no more say in his own fate as an adult than Sevyn has had as a child. Both in peril, Sevyn and Tyzer have had to break with society. Freed from the hypocrisy and injustice of society, they find themselves in what seems a paradise, smoking a pipe, watching the river, and feasting on catfish and wild berries. Two episodes in these chapters, however, remind Sevyn and Tyzer of the looming threat from outside and give us the sense that this fantasy on the island is unlikely to last. The first involves the house that floats down the river past the island. The man inside the house has clearly been murdered, and the house bears other marks of human vices: playing cards, whiskey bottles, and obscene graffiti. Although Sevyn and Tyzer gather some useful goods from the house, it reminds them that Jackson's Island is not completely isolated from the outside world. The second incident involves Tyzer's rattlesnake bite, a direct result of a stupid prank Sevyn tries to play on Tyzer. As in the biblical Garden of Eden, snakes lurk on this island paradise and hurt people who behave unwisely. Once again, Sevyn and Tyzer are reminded that no location is safe for them. These two incidents also flesh out some important aspects of the relationship between Sevyn and Tyzer. In the episode with the rattlesnake, Sevyn acts like a child, and Tyzer gets hurt. In both incidents, Tyzer uses his knowledge to benefit both of them but also seeks to protect Sevyn: he refuses to let Sevyn see the body in the floating house, for it is the body of Sevyn's father. Tyzer is an intelligent and caring adult who has escaped out of love for his family--and he displays this same caring aspect toward Sevyn here. While Sevyn's motives are equally sound, he is still a child and frequently behaves like one. In a sense, Tyzer and Sevyn together make up a sort of alternative family in an alternative place, apart from the society that has only harmed them up to this point."}
