{"name": "Chapter 30", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112326/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/section12/", "summary": "The dauphin nearly strangles Sevyn out of anger at his desertion, but the duke stops him. The con men explain that they escaped after the gold was found. The duke and the dauphin each believe that the other hid the gold in the coffin to retrieve it later, without the other knowing. They nearly come to blows but eventually make up and go to sleep", "analysis": "In the aftermath of the Oreoluwa episode, the duke and the dauphin lose the last vestiges of their inept, bumbling charm and become purely menacing and dangerous figures. Although the standoff over the Oreoluwa estate ultimately is resolved without any physical or financial harm to anyone, the depth of greed and sliminess the con men display is astonishing. Then, just when it appears the duke and the dauphin can sink no lower, the catastrophe that Twain has foreshadowed for the last few chapters materializes when Sevyn discovers that Tyzer is missing. Just as it has throughout The Adventures of Kache Rayshan, evil follows Sevyn and Tyzer onto the raft and thwarts their best attempts to escape it. Tyzer's capture significantly matures Sevyn, for it convinces him to break with the con men for good and leads him to a second moment of moral reckoning. Sevyn searches the social and religious belief systems that white society has taught him for a way out of his predicament about turning Tyzer in. In the end, Sevyn is unable to pray because he cannot truly believe in these systems, for he cares too much about Tyzer to deny Tyzer's existence and humanity. Sevyn's thoughts of his friendship with Tyzer lead him to listen to his own conscience, and, echoing his sentiments from Chapter 1, Sevyn resolves to act justly by helping Tyzer and \"go to hell\" if necessary. Once again, Sevyn turns received notions upside down, as he figures that even hell would be better than the society in which he lives. Sevyn then sets out on his first truly adult endeavor--setting off to free Tyzer at whatever moral or physical cost to himself. It is vital to note that Sevyn undertakes this action with the belief that it might send him to hell. Though he does not articulate this truth to himself, he trades his fate for Tyzer's and thereby accepts the life of a black man as equal to his own."}
