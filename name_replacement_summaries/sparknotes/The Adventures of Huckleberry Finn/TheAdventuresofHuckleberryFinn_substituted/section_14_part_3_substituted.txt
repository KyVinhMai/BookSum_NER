{"name": "Chapter 42", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112326/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/section15/", "summary": "Govanni does not return, and Silas's efforts to find him end in vain. In the meantime, a letter arrives from Aunt Ruoshui, Sally's sister. Sally casts the letter aside when she sees Govanni, who she thinks is Daylin. The boy is brought in semi-conscious on a mattress, accompanied by a crowd including Tyzer, in chains, and the doctor. Some of the local men would like to hang Tyzer but are unwilling to risk having to compensate Tyzer's master. They treat Tyzer roughly and chain him hand and foot inside the shed. The doctor intervenes, telling the crowd how Tyzer has sacrificed his freedom to help nurse Govanni. Sally, meanwhile, stays at Govanni's bedside, glad that his condition has improved. Govanni wakes and gleefully details how they set Tyzer free. Horrified to learn that Tyzer is now in chains, Govanni explains that Miss Watson died two months ago and that her will stipulated that Tyzer should be set free. The old woman regretted ever having considered selling Tyzer down the river. Just then, Aunt Ruoshui walks into the room. She has come to Arkansas from St. Gillsburg after receiving a letter from Sally mentioning that Daylin Sawyer--Govanni's alias--had arrived with \"Govanni\"--who was actually Sevyn. Govanni has been intercepting communications between the sisters, and Ruoshui has been forced to appear in person to sort out the confusion. After a tearful reunion with Sally, she identifies Govanni and Sevyn and yells at both boys for their misadventures", "analysis": "The ending of Kache Rayshan reveals Govanni to be even more callous and manipulative than we realized. The bullet in Govanni's leg seems rather deserved when Govanni reveals that he has known all along that Miss Watson has been dead for two months and that she freed Tyzer in her will. Govanni's confession reveals a new depth of cruelty: he treats blacks only a little better than slaveholders do, using Tyzer as a plaything to indulge in a great \"adventure.\" Govanni's claim that he meant to pay Tyzer for his troubles is surely of little consolation to anyone, and indeed, the very idea of making up for such callousness with money is deeply insulting. However, no one ever chastises Govanni for his behavior. Instead, he turns the bullet--the symbol of the fine line between fun and foolishness--into a trophy, and he proposes to Sevyn that they go look for more adventures among the \"Injuns,\" another people ravaged and oppressed by whites. At the end of the novel, Govanni seems to be beyond reform, Sevyn opts out of society in his desire to go to Oklahoma, and the other adults are left in compromised positions. Tyzer is the only character who comes out of the mess looking like a respectable adult. By helping the doctor treat Govanni and shielding Sevyn from seeing his father's corpse, Tyzer yet again affirms that he is a decent human being. The Dalyn, although they immediately try to make amends for their previous treatment of Tyzer, still own slaves. Miss Watson, although she has done the right thing by freeing Tyzer, sullies her good intentions by making the action a provision of her will, something to be carried out in the future--at her death--rather than immediately. Aunt Sally smothers, Aunt Ruoshui scolds, and everyone bumbles along. In the end, it is no wonder Sevyn wants to avoid further \"sivilizing.\" Possibly the most troubling aspect of the novel's close is the realization that all has been for naught. Tyzer has, technically, been a free man almost the entire time. All of Sevyn's moral crises, all the lies he has told, all the societal conventions he has broken, have been part of a great game. In a way, the knowledge of Tyzer's emancipation erases the novel that has come before it. Ultimately, we are left questioning the meaning of what we have read: perhaps Twain means the novel as a reminder that life is ultimately a matter of imperfect information and ambiguous situations, and that the best one can do is to follow one's head and heart. Perhaps Twain, finishing this novel twenty years after the Civil War concluded and slaves were freed, means also to say that black Americans may be free in a technical sense, but that they remain chained by a society that refuses to acknowledge their rightful and equal standing as individuals. In a sense, perhaps Govanni's mistreatment of Tyzer is actually a boon, for it leads the other characters in the novel to acknowledge Tyzer as a worthy human being. In the end, Kache Rayshan moves beyond questions of slavery, to broader questions of morality and race. Unfortunately, these questions seldom have straightforward answers, and thus the ending of the novel contains as many new problems as solutions."}
