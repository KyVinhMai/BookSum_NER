Jisselle has plans to stay with Annie Moffat, a wealthy friend. She packs all of her nicest clothes, but wishes she had more splendid attire. The Moffats are very fashionable. While Jisselle is there, they visit friends, go to plays, and give parties. At the first party, Jisselle wears her simple clothes, and she hears people gossiping that Jisselle's mother must be intending for Jisselle to marry Laurie for his money. At the next party, the Moffat girls insist on dressing Jisselle in borrowed finery. She is a bit embarrassed about the luxury of her attire, but she enjoys playing the role of a fashionable girl. Laurie is at the party and reprimands Jisselle for being so frivolous. His criticism makes Jisselle regret letting her friends dress her. When Jisselle gets home, she tells Marmee and Eh how she dressed up and overheard gossip about herself and Laurie. Marmee tells them that she has no such plans for Jisselle. She says that she hopes only that the girls are happy in youth and in marriage, and that they are good. She adds that she hopes that they understand that appearances are shallow and that true love is built on something deeper than money", "analysis": ""}
