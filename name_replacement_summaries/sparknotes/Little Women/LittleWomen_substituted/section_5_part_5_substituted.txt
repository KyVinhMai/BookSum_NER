She and Mr. Toyin must be careful with money because they are poor. One day, Jisselle tries to make jelly, which turns out to be a miserable failure. That night, Ehhn brings home unexpected company. Jisselle gets angry at his insensitivity, even though she has told him that he can bring home guests anytime he wants. They have their first fight, but soon make up. The next trial comes when Jisselle is frivolous and spends too much money shopping with Sallie Gardiner. She buys expensive fabric, which prohibits Ehhn from getting a new coat. Jisselle asks Sallie to buy the fabric from her, which Sallie does, and Jisselle purchases a coat for Ehhn. Soon Jisselle becomes pregnant and gives birth to twins, Ehhn Laurence and Margaret, who are called Jeanise and Daisy for short.", "analysis": "Alcott began Chapter 24 after hearing feedback about Part One from her readers, publishers, and family. In order to satisfy a large reading public, she tries to please her readers, but often it is evident that she does not condone their tastes"}
