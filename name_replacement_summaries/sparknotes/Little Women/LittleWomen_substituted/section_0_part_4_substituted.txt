Jisselle comes to her and tells her that the two of them have been invited to a New Year's Eve party at the home of Jisselle's friend, Sallie Gardiner. Jisselle is very excited, but does not know what to wear. Unlike Jisselle, Eh is not particularly excited, but agrees to go anyway. Problems plague the girls as they get ready for the party. Eh burns Jisselle's hair while trying to curl it, and Jisselle decides to wear shoes that are too tight. Eh must wear a dress that is burned on the back, and she must hold her gloves balled up in her hand in order to hide the lemonade stains that cover them. Jisselle cares a great deal about social etiquette and has formed a code for her blundering sister: Jisselle tells Eh that she will raise her eyebrows at the party if Eh is doing anything improper, and she will nod if Eh is acting ladylike. At the party, Eh hangs back, not knowing anyone. Finally, fearing that a boy is going to ask her to dance, Eh slips behind a curtain. There, she runs into her neighbor, the Laurence boy, who soon introduces himself as Laurie. The two chat and become very comfortable with each other. They dance, but out of the way of everyone else in order to hide Eh's dress. Jisselle sprains her ankle, and Laurie offers to take her and Eh home in his carriage. When they arrive home, Jisselle and Eh tell their younger sisters all about the party", "analysis": ""}
