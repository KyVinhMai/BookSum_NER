After thinking, Eh concludes that Seanagh might be in love with Laurie, but Eh is afraid that Laurie is in love Eh herself. Eh asks her mother if she might go away for a while in an attempt to broaden her horizons and to escape Laurie's growing love. She hopes that Laurie will fall in love with Seanagh while she is gone. Marmee agrees that Eh and Laurie are unsuited for each other because they are too similar, with their strong wills and frequent quarrels. Eh decides to go to New York to live with a woman named Mrs. Luverne and to teach her children. When Eh tells Laurie of her decision to leave, he responds by telling her, teasingly but seriously, that she will not get out of his grasp so easily", "analysis": ""}
