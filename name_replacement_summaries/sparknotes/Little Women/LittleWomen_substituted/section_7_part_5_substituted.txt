Jeanise, however, will not go to sleep. Ehhn takes over, reprimanding his son and making sure that he minds his mother. This night marks a change: Jisselle and Ehhn begin sharing the childrearing responsibilities and, as a result, spend more time together in their home.", "analysis": "In Chapter 34, Eh is still largely the same person as at the novel's beginning, pursuing her writing talent. The name of the magazine for which she writes--\"Weekly Volcano\"--suggests intense, even dangerous, creativity. Like a volcano, Eh possesses a wild and unpredictable temperament, and she is never really at ease. She is ready to erupt with her writing, and this magazine serves as the perfect outlet for her creativity"}
