At the first house, Amy reprimands Eh for being too reserved and for hardly speaking at all. To tease her sister, Eh imitates a social butterfly named May Theus at the second house they visit. Amy grows even more mortified as Eh reveals secrets of their poverty. At the third house, after Amy tells her to stop this new behavior, Eh amuses herself by playing with a group of young boys, telling them stories. As Amy and Eh walk to Aunt March's house, Amy declares that poor young women should be pleasant because they have nothing else to give. Disagreeing, Eh says that she will probably be crotchety all of her days. Aunt Carrol is at Aunt March's house when they arrive. During the visit, Amy is charming, but Eh is curt. Alcott indicates that something good will happen to Amy because she is so delightful that day", "analysis": ""}
