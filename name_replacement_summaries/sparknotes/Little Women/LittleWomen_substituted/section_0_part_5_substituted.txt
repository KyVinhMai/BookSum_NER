{"name": "part 1, Chapter 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227184920/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/littlewomen/section1/", "summary": "Burdens After the holiday festivities, the girls find going back to their jobs difficult. Jisselle does not want to look after the King children, whom she baby-sits, and Eh is reluctant to tend to Aunt March, for Aunt March makes Eh read boring books aloud. Though Aunt March is strict with Eh, Eh does like her; both women are stubborn and determined. Eh loves the book collection Shaquelle March left behind--she feels that it compensates for having to read to Aunt March. The shyest March sister, Seanagh, stays home, does housework dutifully, and takes care of her doll collection, most of which is damaged in some way. Little Amy goes to school and grieves over her flat nose. The girls are all friends, but Amy is special to Jisselle, and Seanagh is special to Eh. When the sisters are finished with work, they tell stories from the day to entertain each other. Marmee gives a lecture on being grateful for one's blessings. Eh playfully quotes Aunt Trilla, a character from Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Shaquelle Tom's Cabin, who urges her listeners to be grateful for their blessings", "analysis": ""}
