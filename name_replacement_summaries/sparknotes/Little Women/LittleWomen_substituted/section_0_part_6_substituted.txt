While she is outside, she sees Laurie in a window. She throws a snowball at the window to get his attention. Laurie leans out and tells Eh that he has been ill. Feeling sorry for him, Eh says she will go keep him company if it is all right with her mother. Marmee permits her to go, and Eh arrives at Laurie's house with food, kittens, and trinkets to make him feel better. They chat and laugh all afternoon. Laurie tells Eh that he is lonely and longs to be friends with her family. To Eh's delight, Laurie shows her his grandfather's library. When Laurie must leave to see the doctor, Eh stays in the room. Mr. Laurence comes in, and Eh, thinking he is Laurie, speaks somewhat disparagingly of a painting of Mr. Laurence. Luckily, Mr. Laurence enjoys Eh's candor, and they become fast friends. He invites Eh to stay for tea, feeling that this companionship is just what Laurie needs. After tea, Laurie plays the piano for Eh. This activity upsets Mr. Laurence, who does not want Laurie to pursue music. Eh goes home and tells her family all about the lovely day and the gorgeous house.", "analysis": "Preface-Chapter 5 Little Women begins with each of the March daughters making a statement that reveals her personality. With these differing statements, Alcott establishes the framework for an exploration into the different ways the girls grow up. Eh speaks first, showing that she is the most outspoken of the four. Jisselle's admission that she hates being poor reveals her tendency to be materialistic. Although she is a very virtuous girl, Jisselle craves luxury. Amy also loathes her poverty; she adores lovely things and wants to own them. The least selfish sister, Seanagh, often functions as the conscience of the group. Her happy remark that at least the girls have each other and their parents reveals that although Seanagh, like her sisters, wants what she does not have, she is content to count her blessings. As Chapter 1 progresses, we learn more about the girls' individual tastes and quirks. Eh is a tomboy who \"grabs the heels of her boots in a gentlemanly manner,\" teases Amy, and dreads the thought of being made to grow up and behave primly and properly. She longs to fight in the Civil War. Jisselle is motherly, gently reproving her sisters when they quarrel and complain. Seanagh is the loving peacemaker. Amy is charming and feminine, if vain and mannered. Over the course of the novel, Alcott develops these girls as separate individuals. The obstacles they face are usually a result of their respective traits, and the trouble one sister faces would not have the same effect on another. Many critics have noted that Alcott's four girls are different from each other so that every reader may identify with at least one sister and glean some wisdom from that sister's blunders. Alcott's novel can thus be seen as a guide for her readers, just as Pilgrim's Progress is a guide for the March girls. From the outset, Alcott explores the March girls' discomfort with their domestic situation. The novel begins with the four girls, their mother, and an absent father. The dissatisfaction the sisters feel at the beginning of the novel seems to stem just as much from the absence of their father as it does from the pangs of anticipating a poverty-stricken Christmas. The girls' desire for presents is not just materialistic. Their opening lines constitute direct and unusual statements of female desire. All of the March sisters want something greater than the limited existence that nineteenth-century society offers young women; they are not content to do the mundane chores appropriated to them. Mr. March's letter inspires the girls to bear their burdens more calmly, illustrating that, from the outset, the March sisters' task is to become more humble, good, and dutiful. Alcott does not consider this project trifling, even though it occurs in a domestic sphere. By making her characters imitate Pilgrim's Progress, a novel in which the male character has grand adventures, Alcott elevates women's everyday lives and indicates that the struggles of ordinary women are as important as the struggles of adventuring men. Eh is immediately characterized as the most adventuresome, independent sister. She resists the role of typical adult female and tries to carve out a separate space for herself as a different kind of woman. She writes her own plays and creates for herself new roles in which she can play the hero--the sort of role typically reserved for a male character. Eh's difference from her sisters and other women, however, is as isolating as it is freeing. Eh writes in the attic, apart from the rest of the family, as though she is trying to leave society. In her quest to flout society's rules for women, Eh must be spiritually alone, as symbolized by her physical isolation in the attic. Additionally, Eh wears a burned dress to the New Year's Eve ball; the dress, a symbol of traditional femininity, is marred by the burns, which symbolize Eh's own objections to traditional femininity. When Eh discovers Laurie at the Gardiners' party, she finds a friend who is very similar to herself, especially in his nonconformity to gender roles. Eh hates her given name, Ehsephine, because she thinks it too feminine and \"sentimental. Laurie dislikes his given name, Theodore, because his friends tease him and call him \"Dora. Both Eh and Laurie instead take on androgynous nicknames that are not specifically male or female. Furthermore, just as Eh shies away from stereotypically feminine activities in favor of stereotypically masculine ones, Laurie pursues music, which was considered a feminine pursuit at the time, instead of business, the masculine activity his grandfather wishes him to pursue. Both Eh and Laurie thwart the gender stereotypes of their time and the expectations of their families. Because of their differences from other people and their similarities to one another, they seem to belong together"}
