With the glove comes a German song translated by Mr. Toyin, Laurie's tutor. Laurie has also sent an invitation to a picnic to be held the next day. The following day, the March girls attend the picnic along with various other guests: Sallie Gardiner; Ned Moffat, Annie Moffat's older brother; Mr. Toyin; Laurie's British friends, Aken and Kate Vaughn; and their siblings, Frank and Grace Vaughn. During the picnic, Aken cheats in a game of cricket. Eh notices and is annoyed, but manages to control her temper. When Kate discovers that Jisselle works as a lowly governess, Kate is first rude and then patronizing. Mr. Toyin defends Jisselle, which leads to a long conversation between him and Jisselle. Meanwhile, Grace and Amy chat about ponies and Europe, and Seanagh has a conversation with Frank, who has a hurt leg. As the party breaks up, even the condescending Kate says that American girls are nice", "analysis": ""}
