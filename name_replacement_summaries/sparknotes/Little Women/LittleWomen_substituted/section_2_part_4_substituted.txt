She is very anxious. She meets Laurie as she comes out of the news office. After he pleads with her to tell him what is going on, she confides her secret. Laurie then tells Eh his secret--that Mr. Toyin has kept Jisselle's glove and carries it with him wherever he goes. This secret disgusts Eh, because she hates the idea of someone loving Jisselle and taking her away. Laurie, in an attempt to cheer Eh, persuades her to race him down a hill. In a wild, messy state, they encounter Jisselle, who has just visited the Gardiners. Jisselle reprimands Eh, though she secretly feels tempted to join their romp. For about a week, Eh behaves strangely. Then, one day, she reads a story aloud from a paper and announces at the end that the story was hers. She has not gotten paid, but she says that she will for future stories. She feels wonderfully independent", "analysis": ""}
