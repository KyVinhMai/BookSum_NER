He spends some time in Austria working on a requiem and an opera. He tries to make Eh his heroine, but she seems ill fit to be his artistic muse, or inspiration, so he begins to imagine a blonde damsel, although he does not name her. Laurie also begins to correspond with Amy frequently. When Aken Vaughn finally proposes, Amy turns him down because she does not want to marry for money. Amy and Laurie find out about Seanagh's death at nearly the same time, and Laurie goes to comfort Amy. They begin to spend much time together and fall in love. One day, Laurie and Amy are boating on a river. Laurie is doing the rowing, and Amy asks to help, telling him that he looks tired. They begin to row smoothly together, and Laurie asks Amy if she will always row in the same boat as him--that is, if she will marry him. Amy responds that she will", "analysis": ""}
