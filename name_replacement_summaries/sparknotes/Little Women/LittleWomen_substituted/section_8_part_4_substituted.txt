One day, she confides to her father how much she misses Seanagh. Word arrives that Amy and Laurie are engaged, and Marmee is worried about how Eh will take the news. Eh is calm, though, and pleased that they are in love. She does wish that she could find a love of her own, but she does not begrudge Amy Laurie's affections. Eh begins to write more, and finds a style that is all her own. It has more truth in it than her previous sensationalist writing, and magazines publish many of her stories. She begins to think about Professor Bhaer sentimentally, hoping that he will come for her", "analysis": ""}
