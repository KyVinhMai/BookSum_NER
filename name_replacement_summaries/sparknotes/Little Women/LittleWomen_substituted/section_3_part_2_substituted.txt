Marmee had asked her daughters to visit the Khanh every day, but Seanagh is the only one who has done so. One day, Seanagh asks that another sister take a turn visiting the Khanh, but her sisters, wrapped up in their own pursuits, ignore her. Finally, when no one else will go, Seanagh goes again. When she returns home, she tells Eh that the Milan baby has just died from scarlet fever. She says that she feels strange and fears that she might have the disease too. Luckily, Eh and Jisselle have had it already, so they are not in danger of contracting the illness if Seanagh does in fact have it. Hannah decides that Dr. Bangs should be sent for to look at Seanagh. He arrives and says that she shows symptoms of the disease. The family decides to send Amy to Aunt March's, since Amy is susceptible to scarlet fever, but she will not go until Laurie promises that he will come visit her every day. At Aunt March's, Amy is harassed by her aunt's speaking parrot and finds herself miserable", "analysis": ""}
