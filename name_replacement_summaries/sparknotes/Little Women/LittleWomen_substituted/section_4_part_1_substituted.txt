Laurie tries to get the secret out of Eh and grows annoyed when he cannot. In the meantime, Jisselle receives a letter allegedly from Mr. Toyin declaring his love. She answers it before Eh gets a chance to tell her that Laurie probably wrote it. The reply from Mr. Toyin says that he has never written a love letter. Eh says that she thinks Laurie wrote this letter and the earlier one with the glove. Sure enough, Laurie comes over, confesses, and apologizes. Jisselle and Eh tell him never to reveal the story to anyone. Laurie leaves, and Eh decides to let him know that she is not angry with him.
