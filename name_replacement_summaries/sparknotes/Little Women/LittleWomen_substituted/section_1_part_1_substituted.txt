Jisselle loves to walk in the greenhouse there, and Amy loves to look at the artwork. Seanagh loves Mr. Laurence's piano, but she is still afraid of him; she will not venture far inside the house. Mr. Laurence learns of Seanagh's fears and comes over to the Marches' house one night, talking about how no one plays the piano and how no one is around the house during the day. With that assurance, Seanagh decides to venture into the house during the day and play the piano. Unbeknownst to her, Mr. Laurence sometimes leaves his door open to hear her play. Seanagh reminds him of his beloved granddaughter who passed away. After a while, Seanagh makes Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers to show her gratitude. In return, he sends her the little piano that his granddaughter owned, which thrills Seanagh. Eh tells Seanagh that she should go thank him, thinking that her shy sister would never be so bold.
