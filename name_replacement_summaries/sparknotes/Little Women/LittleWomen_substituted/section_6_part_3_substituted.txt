She says that she is trying to absorb every beautiful attraction. Along the way, she runs into Aken and Frank Vaughn, Laurie's English friends. She and Shellyanne, Aunt Carrol's daughter, spend a lot of time with them, and it becomes clear that Aken is interested in courting Amy. She decides that she will accept him if he proposes. She is not madly in love with him, but she likes him and thinks that his fortune will help the whole family. But Aken finds out that Frank is very ill, and must leave abruptly.
