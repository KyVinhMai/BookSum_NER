{"name": "Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210117124531/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/section2/", "summary": "\"Dr. Jekyll Was Quite at Ease\" Two weeks later, Jekyll throws a well-attended dinner party. Utterson stays late so that the two men can speak privately. Utterson mentions the will, and Jekyll begins to make a joke about it, but he turns pale when Utterson tells him that he has been \"learning something of young Hyde. Jekyll explains that the situation with Hyde is exceptional and cannot be solved by talking. He also insists that \"the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. But Jekyll emphasizes the great interest he currently takes in Hyde and his desire to continue to provide for him. He makes Utterson promise that he will carry out his will and testament.", "analysis": "Utterson behaves here like an amateur detective, as he does throughout the rest of the novel. However, unlike most detectives, he faces a gulf between what seems to be the factual evidence of the case and the supernatural reality behind it. This gulf is apparent in Utterson's reading of the will, for instance. On the face of it, Jekyll's stipulation that all his property be handed over to Hyde and his later horror at the thought of Utterson \"learning something of young Hyde\" seem to point squarely at blackmail of some sort. Of course, Utterson never imagines the situation that lies behind these behaviors. Similarly, the will's reference to \"death or disappearance\"  makes Utterson immediately think of the possibility of murder. The idea that Jekyll could literally transform himself into another and thereby disappear simply does not occur to Utterson, as it would not occur to any rational person. Utterson's failure to detect the truth does not demonstrate any failure in logic. However, Stevenson does contrive to have his hardheaded lawyer access the dark supernatural undercurrents at work in the case of Jekyll and Hyde--if only in a limited way. Stevenson enlightens Utterson through the use of the dream sequence. In Utterson's dreams, the faceless figure of Hyde stalks through the city: \"if at any time  dozed over,\" the author writes, \"it was but to see  glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly. through wider labyrinths of lamp-lighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming. In Utterson's dreams, then, Hyde appears ubiquitous, permeating the city with his dark nature and his crimes. This idea of Hyde as a universal presence suggests that this faceless figure, crushing children and standing by Jekyll's bed, symbolizes all the secret sins that lurk beneath the surface of respectable London. This notion of hidden crimes recurs throughout the novel. It is significant that Stevenson never gives us any details of Jekyll's indiscretions prior to his creation of Hyde, nor of Hyde's wicked, dissipated habits. The crimes remain shrouded in mystery; to explain them in rational language would strip them of their supernatural and eerie quality. Hyde's ugliness prompts a similar loss of words. When Utterson finally converses with Hyde and sees his face, like Enfield, he proves unable to comprehend and delineate exactly what makes Hyde so ugly and frightening. Significantly, though, one of the words that the fumbling lawyer comes up with is \"troglodyte,\" a term referring to a prehistoric, manlike creature. Through this word, the text links the immoral Hyde to the notion of recidivism--a fall from civilization and a regression to a more primitive state. The imperialist age of Victorian England manifested a great fear of recidivism, particularly in its theories of racial science, in which theorists cautioned that lesser, savage peoples might swallow up the supposedly -superior white races. The description of Jekyll's house introduces an element of clear symbolism. The doctor lives in a well-appointed home, described by Stevenson as having \"a great air of wealth and comfort. The building secretly connects to his laboratory, which faces out on another street and appears sinister and run-down. It is in the laboratory that Dr. Jekyll becomes Mr. Hyde. Like the two secretly connected buildings, seemingly having nothing to do with each other but in fact easily traversed, the upstanding Jekyll and the corrupt Hyde appear separate but in fact share an unseen inner connection. These chapters also introduce us to the minor character of Dr. Lanyon, Jekyll's former colleague. Lanyon's labeling of Jekyll's research as \"unscientific balderdash\" hints at the supernatural bent of the experiments, which contrasts powerfully with the prevailing scientific consensus of the Victorian world, in which rationalism and materialism held sway. In his reverence for the rational and -logical, Lanyon emerges as the quintessential nineteenth-century scientist, automatically dismissing Jekyll's mystical experiments. Later events prove that his dogmatic faith in a purely material science is more akin to superstition than Jekyll's experiments"}
