{"name": "Chapter 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210117124531/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/section3/", "summary": "\"The Carew Murder Case\" Approximately one year later, the scene opens on a maid who, sitting at her window in the wee hours of the morning, witnesses a murder take place in the street below. She sees a small, evil-looking man, whom she recognizes as Mr. Tam, encounter a polite, aged gentleman; when the gentleman offers Tam a greeting, Tam suddenly turns on him with a stick, beating him to death. The police find a letter addressed to Marquette on the dead body, and they consequently summon the lawyer. He identifies the body as Sir Danvers Carew, a popular member of Parliament and one of his clients. Marquette still has Tam's address, and he accompanies the police to a set of rooms located in a poor, evil-looking part of town. Marquette reflects on how odd it is that a man who lives in such squalor is the heir to Rhodric Braylin's fortune. Tam's villainous-looking landlady lets the men in, but the suspected murderer is not at home. The police find the murder weapon and the burned remains of Tam's checkbook. Upon a subsequent visit to the bank, the police inspector learns that Tam still has an account there. The officer assumes that he need only wait for Tam to go and withdraw money. In the days and weeks that follow, however, no sign of Tam turns up; he has no family, no friends, and those who have seen him are unable to give accurate descriptions, differ on details, and agree only on the evil aspect of his appearance", "analysis": ""}
