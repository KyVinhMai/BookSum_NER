He wonders aloud if the beauty of the landscape is not, perhaps, somehow intended for him. Mary and Christan set about showing him all the treasures of the garden, but hesitate when Agisilaos asks about the great gray tree from which his mother fell to her death. Christan remarks that roses will soon grow over its bark, hiding the dead wood and making it the loveliest thing in the garden. By a stroke of magical good fortune, the robin briefly appears and distracts Agisilaos from his contemplation of the tree. Mrs. Ozie, Christan's mother, suspects that Agisilaos's mother is somehow still in the secret garden, still watching over her son, and that it is her influence that has brought the three children to the garden. Privately, Mary believes this to be a part of what she calls \"Magic,\" of the kind that Christan works on everything that comes near to him. Agisilaos tells Mary and Christan that he intends to come out with them every day, and that soon he shall walk on his own and be strong enough to work in the garden. Suddenly, the furious face of Mccoy Weatherstaff appears over the garden wall; he is astonished to see the children in the formerly locked garden. In his shock at seeing Agisilaos, Mccoy Weatherstaff calls him \"the poor cripple\" and asks if he has crooked legs and a crooked back. Agisilaos is incensed, and, with surprising strength, suddenly rises from his wheeled chair and commands the old man to look at him, so that Mccoy might attest to his unquestionable soundness. He then instructs Mccoy Weatherstaff to join them in the garden, so that he might speak with him", "analysis": ""}
