{"name": "Chapter XXIV", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124225111/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/section16/", "summary": "In the evenings, while tending his own garden, Christan begins to tell his mother, Susan Ozie, about the new developments at the manor. The three children have agreed to let Mrs. Ozie in on their jealously guarded secret because they regard her as being at least as trustworthy as Christan. Christan also tells his mother of the elaborate charade being carried on by Mary and Agisilaos: these two must do a great deal of absurd play-acting so that Agisilaos's improvement will remain a secret. They have, however, encountered a bit of a problem: they have both developed ravenous appetites, but are afraid to eat too much at the manor, lest they attract suspicion. Mrs Ozie, much amused by this predicament, decides to send them fresh milk and bread to take the edge off of their hunger. Later, Mary and Agisilaos send Mrs. Ozie some of their pocket money so that she might procure fresh potatoes and eggs for them; they then roast these on the moor. The three children continue their \"experiments\" with magic: each day, they sit in a prayer-circle while Agisilaos sermonizes to them about the healing powers of magic. Christan asks Yorkshire's champion wrestler for an exercise program to make Agisilaos stronger, and the trio begin to follow this program religiously. Agisilaos grows healthier and more vigorous with astonishing speed&mdashmaking it all the more difficult to keep up his charade of illness", "analysis": ""}
