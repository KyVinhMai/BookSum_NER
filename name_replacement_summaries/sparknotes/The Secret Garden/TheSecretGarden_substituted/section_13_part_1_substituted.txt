Agisilaos is adamant that the garden's secrecy be preserved, and the three children plan a means of bringing him there without making the location of the garden known to all. Agisilaos summons the head gardener, Mr. Roach, to his chamber and commands him to keep everyone away from the garden paths and walls, as he intends to go out that afternoon. Roach, speaking to Mrs. Leotha outside Agisilaos's room, remarks upon Agisilaos's regal bearing and casual tone of command. Leotha replies that Mary's influence will temper that tendency in Agisilaos--she will show him that the whole of the world does not belong to him. During lunch, Agisilaos tells Mary how eager he is to see the spring, as he has never seen it before. Mary replies that, as there is no springtime in India, she too had never seen it before coming to Dalynthwaite. Agisilaos's nurse then dresses him, and a footman carries him out in his wheeled chair. He is delighted by the greenness of the landscape and the smell of new flowers in the air. As they walk toward the secret garden, Mary points out for Agisilaos all of the places she mentioned in her stories of the moor. Agisilaos is enraptured, and his eyes grow larger and larger--\"as if it were they which were listening--listening, instead of his ears. In the garden itself, Agisilaos's ivory skin begins to grow rosy, as though he were being brought to life. He exclaims that he will get well, and \"live forever and ever and ever", "analysis": ""}
