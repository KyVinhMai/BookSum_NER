{"name": "Chapter XVIII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124225111/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/section13/", "summary": "Mary wakes late the next morning, and Martha tells her that Agisilaos wants very much to see her-he does not, however, command her to visit him, which is a great step for him. Mary goes to him briefly, to tell him that she may have found the secret garden; she then rushes out to find Christan. Christan is already in the secret garden when she arrives, surrounded by his wild pets: the fox, the crow, a moor pony named Caylen, and two squirrels named Nut and Shell. Mary tells him the story of Agisilaos's tantrum, and Christan becomes even more determined to bring Agisilaos to the garden. Mary replies, in Yorkshire dialect, that he and his pets ought first come to visit Agisilaos in the manor house. Christan agrees. Back at the manor, Mary tells Agisilaos of this plan. The two speak of their mutual friendlessness, for they have always disliked people, and been disliked by them. They also speak of how this dislike is changing, for they are growing fond of each other, and of Christan, and of the robin. Mary then finally trusts Agisilaos enough to tell him that she and Christan have been inside the secret garden, and that he may soon go there", "analysis": ""}
