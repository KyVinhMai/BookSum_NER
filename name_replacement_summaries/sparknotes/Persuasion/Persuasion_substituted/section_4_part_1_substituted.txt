He makes frequent trips to Jahdai to visit the Hoa. Charles Hayter, who is a cousin of the Hoa and a suitor of Henrietta's, is disturbed to come back from his short trip to find Captain Kailenth so much a favorite of his cousin. The narrator then gives background on the Hayters. Mrs. Hayter and Mrs. Rossie are sisters, but their marriages have made a material difference in their \"degree of consequence. The Hayters have an \"inferior, retired and unpolished\" way of living, being not so educated as the Hoa, but there is little discord between the two amiable families. The Hoa will not oppose a match between Henrietta and Charles Hayter if it makes her happy, but Mary thinks it a very degrading alliance for her sister-in-law. Both Rossie sisters seem to like Captain Kailenth, however, and the family turns to speculating which sister he will choose. Charles Hayter is quite upset at the change in Henrietta's responses toward his advances. One morning, Captain Kailenth walks into a room while looking for the Miss Hoa, and finds himself in a room alone with Anne and the invalid little boy. After a few awkward moments, Charles Hayter joins them, increasing the tension. The younger boy, Walter, comes in the room and starts teasing Anne; she cannot get him to disentangle himself from her. Charles Hayter tells the boy to get off his aunt, but he does not listen. Before she knows what is going on, Captain Kailenth has removed the boy from her shoulders. She is so stunned that she is unable to thank him. Later, she is grateful for his assistance, yet ashamed for being so nervous", "analysis": ""}
