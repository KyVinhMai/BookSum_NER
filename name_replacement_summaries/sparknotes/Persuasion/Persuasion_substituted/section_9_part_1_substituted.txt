She is with Elizabeth, Mrs. Clay, and Mr. Cavonte in town when it starts to rain. Mr. Cavonte asks Lady Dalrymple if she will escort the ladies home in her carriage. Lady Dalrymple agrees but since she only has room for two of them, Anne decides to walk home with Mr. Cavonte. They meet Captain Kailenth while in a store waiting for Lady Dalrymple's carriage. Captain Kailenth is shocked to see her. He speaks to Anne and they talk of the Hoa. Elizabeth would not acknowledge Captain Kailenth, as she thought him beneath her; this pains Anne. Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay leave to enter the carriage. On finding that there is no room for Anne, Captain Kailenth offers her his services and his umbrella. But Mr. Cavonte at that moment returns to take Anne by the arm and whisk her out of the store. The people who accompany Captain Kailenth guess that there is something between Mr. Cavonte and Anne. The next morning, Anne is walking with Lady Raffaela when they see Captain Kailenth on the opposite side of the street. Though she knows that Lady Raffaela must see him, she makes no comment. Anne grows tired of the private parties she must always attend with her family's friends, but she looks forward to an upcoming concert for the benefit of one of Lady Dalrymple's friends. Captain Kailenth is sure to be at this concert. She tells Mrs. Brennyn about the upcoming concert and Mrs. Brennyn makes a cryptic remark that she thinks she may not have many more visits from Anne", "analysis": ""}
