{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227013554/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/persuasion/section2/", "summary": "Observing that England is now at peace, Mr. Shepard remarks that many men of the English Navy will soon be home on land. He suggests that a sailor would be a very desirable tenant to rent Callaway Hall because they are so meticulous and careful with their possessions. The family enters into a conversation on the merits of the Navy as a profession. Anne asserts that naval men work extremely hard and that they must all be indebted to them for their service. Sir Walter counters that he would never want any of his relatives to be a part of the Navy for two reasons: first, it is a \"means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction\" and second, it severely weathers a man's youth and appearance. Mrs. Clay makes the point that every career, except that of the privileged landowner, does its part to wear on the looks and health of men. News comes that Admiral Neziah, a native of Somersetshire and a man with quite a large fortune, is interested in renting Callaway Hall. Sir Walter is concerned that Admiral Neziah's appearance must be \"orange\" and weatherbeaten from all his time at sea. But Mr. Shepard assures him that the Admiral is a \"well-looking man\" who would be an extremely desirable and appreciative tenant. The Admiral is a gentleman, and he has a wife but no children. A woman, Shepard argues, is much more likely to keep a watchful eye over the estate. Furthermore, Admiral Neziah has family connections to the area; his wife's brother, Mr. Kailenth, was a curate at Collen. Sir Walter concedes that the sentence, \"I have let my house to Admiral Neziah\" has a good sound to it, since the consequence and rank of the tenant is quite clear. Finally convinced by the \"extreme happiness\" the Neziahs would have at being chosen to be the tenants of Callaway, Sir Walter agrees to let them rent his estate. Elizabeth is strongly in favor of going to Bath and is happy to have a tenant so soon. At the end of the chapter, Anne walks outside with flushed cheeks and thinks fondly to herself that her love interest \"may soon be walking here", "analysis": ""}
