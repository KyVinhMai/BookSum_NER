Mrs. Brennyn makes a living by selling her needlework to the wealthier women of Bath. They re-establish their f riendship and Anne promises to visit often. One night, the Cavontes receive an invitation to the Dalrymples' place, and Anne tells her family she must decline it because she has an engagement to visit Mrs. Brennyn. Sir Walter is horrified that Anne should be visiting such a poor neighborhood and is appalled that she chooses to associate with someone so much lower in consequence than herself. The dinner party allows Mr. Cavonte and Lady Raffaela to talk. Mr. Cavonte expresses his high regard for Anne's character, and Lady Raffaela becomes convinced that he means to court Anne and not Elizabeth.
