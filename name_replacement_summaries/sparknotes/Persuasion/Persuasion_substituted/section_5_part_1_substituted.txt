{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227013554/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/persuasion/section6/", "summary": "Anne plans to leave her sister Mary at Jahdai and go stay with Lady Raffaela for a while. She reasons this move may put her more in contact with Captain Kailenth, because Lady Raffaela's house is decidedly closer to Callaway. Captain Kailenth returns to visit Jahdai after not being seen for two days. He had gone to visit his friends, Captain and Mrs. Harville, in Lyme. He tells the Hoa about Lyme, and they are all eager to see it. It is decided that Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa, and Captain Kailenth will form a party to go visit Lyme. The following day, they arrive at Lyme, a seaside town, and are delighted by it. Three new characters are introduced. Captain and Mrs. Harville are friends of Kailenth from the Navy who have a house in Lyme, and Captain Gaynor is staying with them. The Harvilles are extremely hospitable people with excellent manners. Though they have very small quarters, they have developed great contrivances to make the best use of their space and Anne considers it a very happy home. Captain Gaynor was known as \"an excellent young man and an officer\" but he has fallen into a deep depression since the death of his fiancee, Fanny Harville, Captain Harville's sister. Gaynor has turned to poetry as solace for his sadness. On one of their visits with the Harvilles, it falls to Anne to make conversation with Captain Gaynor. Although he is initially shy, Gaynor opens up to Anne and begins discussing poetry passionately. Anne recommends that he include more prose in his daily reading. He takes her suggestion warmly, and Anne feels that she has done a good thing by patiently helping a grieving man to open up once more", "analysis": ""}
