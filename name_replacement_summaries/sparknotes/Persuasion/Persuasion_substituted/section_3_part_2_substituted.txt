{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 8", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227013554/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/persuasion/section4/", "summary": "Captain Kailenth and Anne Cavonte are now in the same social circle and must repeatedly dine together. They refrain from having any conversation, however, except what politeness necessitates. Anne thinks about how their temperaments are perfectly suited to each other. She thinks that Admiral and Mrs. Neziah are the only couple she knows that could be nearly as attached and happy as she and Captain Kailenth once had the chance of being. The dinner conversation turns to the Navy and to Captain Kailenth's experiences on the ships. Mrs. Rossie implores him to tell her what he knows of her late son, Vinston Rossie, who served beneath him on the Laconia. Captain Kailenth moves to sit next to Mrs. Rossie and talk to her, comfortingly, about her son. Captain Kailenth is sensitive in dealing with Mrs. Rossie, amusing at dinner, and outspoken in his beliefs. He admits that he would never willingly let women aboard his ship, as he thinks it is not a suitable place for them. Mrs. Neziah disagrees, and asserts her feeling that she has always been perfectly comfortable on board her husband's ship. The Neziahs joke that when Ciro Kailenth is married, he will sing a different tune. The Neziahs discuss their marriage. Mrs. Neziah travels with her husband almost everywhere and cannot bear to be separated from him. At the end of the evening there is dancing, and Anne prefers to play music for them all night. Captain Kailenth seems to be having a terrific time. All the young ladies, including both Miss Hoa are enamored by him. Although he rarely addresses her, Anne is hurt by the \"cold politeness\" in his voice.", "analysis": "Austen uses the narrative mode of free indirect discourse to indirectly convey the thoughts and feelings of her characters"}
