Toby cannot stop his worrying, however. Tommo's leg continues to throb, despite native treatments. Toby agrees to travel to Nukuheva for him to get some proper medicine from a French ship. The Typees tentatively consent to the plan and Marheyo walks Toby down the trail to the border of the Happar territory. Several hours later, Tommo hears screaming in the village and comes out to find a bloody and unconscious Toby. After Toby wakes, he explains that on his journey he came across some Happars who attacked him with a spear. Toby then collapsed on his way home, until some random Typees found him. The Typees use Toby's story to confirm that the Happars are a bad and savage group, even explaining that the Happars are cannibals. Toby and Tommo take the news more somberly, realizing now that it will be very difficult for them to escape the area", "analysis": ""}
