One morning as he is resting, he hears a great commotion because a group of French ships have sailed into the Typee bay. The natives all start gathering produce and goods to bring to the ships. Tommo wants to go too, but Kory-Kory refuses to carry him there. Eventually, the Typees agree that Toby can come to get the medicine for Tommo, but that Tommo needs to stay and rest. Around sunset, the Typees start filtering back. Toby, however, does not return. The Typees seem evasive when explaining where Toby has gone. Eventually, Tommo seeks out Fayaway. She explains that Toby went away with one of the boats and plans to return in three days. Tommo feels depressed and also trapped in the village. The natives show increasing kindness toward him, however, and treat him with the utmost attention, especially Kory-Kory and Fayaway", "analysis": ""}
