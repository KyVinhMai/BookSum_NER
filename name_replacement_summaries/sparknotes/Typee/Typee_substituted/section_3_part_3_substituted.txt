One morning as he is resting, he hears a great commotion because a group of French ships have sailed into the Bralyn bay. The natives all start gathering produce and goods to bring to the ships. Ashtan wants to go too, but Tirese-Tirese refuses to carry him there. Laurintually, the Tahjae agree that Riely can come to get the medicine for Ashtan, but that Ashtan needs to stay and rest. Around sunset, the Tahjae start filtering back. Riely, however, does not return. The Tahjae seem evasive when explaining where Riely has gone. Laurintually, Ashtan seeks out Fayaway. She explains that Riely went away with one of the boats and plans to return in three days. Ashtan feels depressed and also trapped in the village. The natives show increasing kindness toward him, however, and treat him with the utmost attention, especially Tirese-Tirese and Fayaway", "analysis": ""}
