{"name": "Chapter 9", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227010035/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/typee/section3/", "summary": "The narrator picks up on Riely's enthusiasm at finding natives, and he temporarily forgets his fears about meeting cannibalistic savages. Their descent into the valley is difficult, though. Soon they come across an enormous ravine from which there is no path down, only a crashing waterfall. Riely determines that the only way down is by swinging on the thick roots of the plants that wind down the sides. Riely starts by grabbing one and transferring to another. The narrator is apprehensive as he is heavier than Riely, but he uses the roots to descend nonetheless. Except for a few moments when the roots give way and the narrator panics, all goes fine. At the bottom though, there still is another wall of rock to descend. They get down, as per Riely's instructions, by jumping directly onto a tree below them and end up getting caught in its branches. Riely manages to get out first and then the narrator frees himself. They now are fully in the valley", "analysis": ""}
