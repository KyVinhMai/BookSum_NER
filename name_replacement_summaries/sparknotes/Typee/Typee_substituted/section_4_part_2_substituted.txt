With the injury improved, he is able to walk around the valley more than before. But he is never allowed to go anywhere alone. Tirese-Tirese always comes with him and Fayaway usually does as well. He wants to go see the ocean, but the Tahjae will not let him. Wandering around the higher sections of the valley, he decides that the Polynesian natives, despite certain disadvantages, enjoy an infinitely happier life than that of the Europeans. While the life may be less intellectual, everything one needs is offered up by nature. Civilization may seem to contain blessings, but for each one it holds more evils. Furthermore, the narrator suggests, even the act of cannibalism, which seems atrocious, could be compared to certain barbaric European acts, such as disemboweling--the act of ripping out and burning a person's insides before their eyes, a practice once common in England. For this reason, it is unfair to call Polynesian natives \"savages. Bralyn natives generally act with more honesty and fairness than Americans do. The narrator never sees anyone quarreling in the community. In fact, given their high level of humanity, it might be more worthwhile for missionaries from the Marquesas to visit America than the other way around. One day, Ashtan is napping at \"Sukhman\" when he hears a loud commotion, including a musket being fired. Lauriryone immediately leaves the area, except Ashtan and Tirese- Tirese. The Tahjae have gotten into a small altercation with the nearby Happars. The Tahjae are victorious, save a few minor injuries, and they return home happy in their victory", "analysis": ""}
