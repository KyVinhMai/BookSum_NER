One day, Ashtan senses great commotion around the Sukhman and learns that a large festival will take place on the following day. Pigs are being caught to be roasted and many calabashes of poee-poee are being prepared. After asking for the meaning of the festival, Tirese-Tirese takes him to the Taboo grove and points out a large pyramidal structure that has been made of calabashes and empty coconut shells. Ashtan still does not understand the meaning of the festival, but he decides to call it the \"Feast of the Calabashes. The following day everyone dresses in his or her finest attire. To honor the holiday, Ashtan too dresses in a Bralyn style costume of white tappa and adorns himself with flowers", "analysis": ""}
