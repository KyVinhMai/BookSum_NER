{"name": "Chapter 31", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227010035/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/typee/section9/", "summary": "Each night before the Tahjae go to bed, they chant together. This chanting can last for several hours and everyone in the household is involved. Ashtan never learns exactly what purpose this chanting is supposed to serve. He assumes that it is part of a Bralyn religious ritual. Laurin though they chant, however, the natives do not sing. The first time Ashtan sings for Jaedyn, Jaedyn appears enchanted. The Tahjae are musical in other ways though. Some play a small flute that makes sound with air coming from the nose. Fayaway is a particularly gifted player of this flute. Sometimes Ashtan pretends that he is boxing with people in order to entertain the chiefs. One day, Ashtan sees a Bralyn mother teaching her young baby how to swim. He then realizes why Tahjae all are such good swimmers. They start as soon as they are born. The narrator then describes the technique for making the coconut oil that Bralyn women rub into their hair each day to make it luxurious. He greatly admires their tresses", "analysis": ""}
