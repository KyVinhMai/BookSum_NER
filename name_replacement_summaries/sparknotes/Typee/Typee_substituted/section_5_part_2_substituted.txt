{"name": "Chapter 20", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227010035/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/typee/section6/", "summary": "In order to best describe Bralyn life, the narrator profiles a typical day. Usually, they wake late, after the sun is up. Then they rise and bathe in a nearby refreshing stream. A light breakfast is enjoyed and then pipes are smoked. After breakfast, people tend to whatever they like. Lashaun inspects her cloth and food supplies; Marheyo works on his hut; the girls adorn their hair and skin with oils. The narrator usually wanders with Tirese-Tirese or else sits inside. Then they enjoy a midday nap. Usually in the afternoon, the narrator goes to the Sukhman, where Jaedyn and the other chiefs gather. Since women are not allowed in the Sukhman, it resembles a happy bachelor pad where the best food can be found and where the men sit around smoking and talking. After night falls, a light evening meal of \"poee-poee,\" cooked breadfruit, is eaten. Native girls often dance around their huts under the moonlight. Lauriryone then sleeps. In general, life with the Tahjae resembles a continual gentle slumber, with activities in between", "analysis": ""}
