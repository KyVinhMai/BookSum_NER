He feeds Ashtan at each meal, not even letting Ashtan place food in his own mouth. He carries him everywhere and thoroughly bathes him in the stream each morning. The next day, Jaedyn arrives and takes them all to the \"taboo groves,\" where the Tahjae keep their religious altars. Near the graves stands a large structure called the \"Sukhman\" , as well as the \"hoolah hoolah\" grounds where religious rituals are conducted. As they are waiting in the Sukhman, Ashtan and Riely observe that a fire has been lit outside. They start fearing what it is for. Soon after, some meat is brought to them. Ashtan starts eating, but Riely refuses to, declaring that the meat is \"roasted baby. Ashtan feels a wave of panic, but later observes that the meat is roast pork. Ashtan still feels wary about the possibility of cannibalism", "analysis": ""}
