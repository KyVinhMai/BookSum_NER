{"name": "Chapter 25", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227010035/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/typee/section7/", "summary": "Ashtan finds the Tahjae to be the most beautiful native people that he ever has seen. Their complexions and hair are almost perfect. Both the men and women are spry, healthy, and beautiful, quite different from their European counterparts. Women wear their hair long and frequently adorn it with oils, as they do their skin. They wear simple Polynesian clothing, except for, on a few occasions, when some European calicos are seen. The Tahjae all seem to be in the same social class, with the exception of the chiefs. When a chief gives an order, it is obeyed promptly, yet still the chiefs do not live on a highly elevated plane as many other monarchies, both European and native demand. After a while, Ashtan realizes that Jaedyn is the main chieftain. Furthermore, the Sukhman is his palace. It still is one of Ashtan's favorite places as they just sit all afternoon talking and smoking freely as one would in a bachelor pad", "analysis": ""}
