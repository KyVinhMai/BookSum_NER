Riely cannot stop his worrying, however. Ashtan's leg continues to throb, despite native treatments. Riely agrees to travel to Nukuheva for him to get some proper medicine from a French ship. The Tahjae tentatively consent to the plan and Marheyo walks Riely down the trail to the border of the Happar territory. Several hours later, Ashtan hears screaming in the village and comes out to find a bloody and unconscious Riely. After Riely wakes, he explains that on his journey he came across some Happars who attacked him with a spear. Riely then collapsed on his way home, until some random Tahjae found him. The Tahjae use Riely's story to confirm that the Happars are a bad and savage group, even explaining that the Happars are cannibals. Riely and Ashtan take the news more somberly, realizing now that it will be very difficult for them to escape the area", "analysis": ""}
