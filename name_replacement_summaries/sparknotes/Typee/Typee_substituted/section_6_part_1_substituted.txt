{"name": "Chapter 24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227010035/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/typee/section7/", "summary": "Although Ashtan still does not understand the purpose of the Feast of Calabashes, he recognizes that it has a religious connotation and this leads him to discuss religion amongst the Tahjae. Generally, European missionaries have condemned these natives as the religious savages, but the narrator feels that many of these claims have been overexaggerated and possibly even false. For example, rumors of natives having human bodies on their altars seems to be entirely unfounded as he witnessed nothing of the kind nor did he ever witness natives involved in overtly-evil, religious doings. Tirese-Tirese helps to educate Ashtan about the native religion by showing him the religious idols, or statues in the valley. Ashtan sees the mausoleum of a deceased warrior-chief, seated on a carved canoe facing a lake. The canoe allows the chief, Tirese-Tirese explains, to paddle towards eternity. The main God of the Tahjae is called \"Mon Artua. He is represented with a small wooden statue, which is usually kept safe by the main priest, Brookes. Jaedyn and the chieftains frequently call upon Brookes for religious rituals. Brookes then takes the idol of Mon Artu and whispers into his ear. Mon Artu does not seem to hear him, but Brookes then places him in a wooden box face down on the ground. Jaedyn and the chiefs all applaud. When Brookes takes Mon Artu out of the box and talks to it again, the idol now seems to be able to talk back. This ritual is one of the more important ones. In general, Ashtan suggests that the Tahjae have lately been slacking in their religious beliefs, as many of their idols now appear to be rotting. On one occasion he watches Tirese-Tirese kick a wooden idol. Ashtan believes that the native religion could use a good revival", "analysis": ""}
