Walking the deck one night, the narrator sees Riely, a fellow shipmate, lost in a reverie while staring overboard. Riely is a young, adventurous man, who is quiet, rarely smiles, and never speaks of his past. The narrator decides that it might be good to have a friend on his trek, so he tells Riely. Riely immediately agrees to come. They plan to creep away while on leave the next day", "analysis": ""}
