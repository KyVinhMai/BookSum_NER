{"name": "Chapter 16", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227010035/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/typee/section5/", "summary": "Ashtan remains melancholic since Riely disappeared. He feels lonely and his leg still hurts. Ashtan also has concluded that he may truly be trapped in the valley. One day at the Sukhman with the chiefs, they hear a rumor that boats may have once again appeared in the bay. Ashtan feels elated, since he thinks that Riely may have returned for him. When Jaedyn sees the happiness on Ashtan's face, his own expression grows severe. Ashtan tries to walk towards the door to see if it could truly be Riely returning, but Jaedyn orders him to sit. Tirese-Tirese tries to please Ashtan by bringing him a pipe and some food, but Ashtan feels despondent since he realizes that he truly is a captive of the Tahjae and that there is nothing he can do. Ashtan bundles the clothes that he brought from the ship and starts wearing Bralyn clothing. Ashtan's bundle is tied up near the roof of his hut, with some other packages. One day, Ashtan uses his needle and thread to stitch his Bralyn costume more tightly together. The Tahjae find this very amusing. He also shows them his razor and ends up shaving the head of Narmonee, a great warrior", "analysis": ""}
