{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 33", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227043948/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/emma/section11/", "summary": "Emma continues to dislike Mrs. Elton, who, noting Emma's reserve, begins to return the sentiment. Emma assumes that Mr. Elton has told his wife something of the unfortunate episode with her and Harriet, to whom the Eltons are especially rude. Mrs. Elton takes on Jane Fairfax as her project, attempting to bring her out socially. Emma is puzzled that Jane refuses another invitation to join Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Mr. and Mrs. Dixon in Ireland. She is also puzzled that Jane accepts Mrs. Elton's attentions, and she discusses Jane's actions with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley defends Jane's acceptance of Mrs. Elton's attentions, and Emma takes the opportunity to probe Mr. Knightley on his feelings for Jane, telling him, \"The extent of your admiration may take you by surprise one day or other. Knightley seems flustered, uneasy, and embarrassed and wonders whether Emma has been playing matchmaker for him. She assures him that she has not, and he insists her that he is not in love with Jane--for one thing, Jane is too reserved. Emma is satisfied that she has been right about Knightley's feelings for Jane and that Mrs. Weston has been wrong, but Mrs. Weston wonders if his eagerness in denying it indicates otherwise", "analysis": "In these chapters, Emma's imaginative preoccupations again shift their focus from meddling in others' lives to understanding the intrigue in her own. Earlier in the novel, Emma occupies herself by envisaging Jane Fairfax's supposed affair with Mr. Dixon, but Jane's reserve and Emma's growing compassion for her have made this line of speculation less worthwhile for Emma; now, for the first time in the novel, Emma imagines herself as the heroine of her own plot. Even so, her sentiments for Frank Churchill are no more real than the feelings that she wrongly attributes to Mr. Elton, Jane, and Mr. Knightley. Notably, her feelings for Frank flourish only in his absence, which leaves Emma not unhappy but \"busy and cheerful.\" She relishes the chance to envision her and Frank's courtship, picturing \"a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters.\" She does not seem to relish the prospect of a courtship itself.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Elton seems like a crude parody of the earlier Emma, exhibiting Emma's mistakes in an exaggerated form. Mrs. Elton is constantly in search of young women to whom she can attach herself and introduce into her society, and she holds matchmaking an important goal. Emma immediately resents Mrs. Elton's presumptuousness in thinking she can make matches between strangers, and Mrs. Elton's blunt, outspoken nature makes us share Emma's resentment. Still, no great difference exists between Mrs. Elton's behavior toward Jane and Emma's behavior toward Harriet, though Emma herself cannot recognize the similarity. Both Emma and Mrs. Elton are guilty of presumption. The conversation Emma and Mrs. Weston have with Knightley presents another example of a dialogue with a subtext that can be understood only upon a second reading of the novel. Knightley is obviously uncomfortable when Emma suggests that he has feelings for Jane, and his uneasy reaction could be interpreted a number of ways. Knightley may flush simply because he resents personal questions, or because, as Mrs. Weston suspects, he is fighting or concealing his feelings for Jane. We suspect that he flushes because he is displeased that Emma so blithely imagines him with someone else, and he seems relieved when she assures him that this has not been the case. Mrs. Weston's willingness to read between the lines and have faith in Knightley's refutation at the end of the chapter reinforces the novel's message that seeking subtexts can alert one to a hidden truth but can just as easily lead one into error."}
