{"name": "Chapter 13", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227044315/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bleakhouse/section3/", "summary": "\"Esther's Narrative\" Esther says that she, Richard, and Mr. Jarndyce have many conversations about what Richard should become. Esther worries that his unstable upbringing has made him indecisive. Richard is indifferent and goes along with whatever they suggest, eventually deciding to pursue medicine. Mr. Jarndyce tries to talk to him seriously about it, but Richard doesn't change his mind. Various guests support Richard's decision, including Mr. Boythorn and Mr. Kenge. Mr. Kenge promises to arrange a place for Richard to study medicine with his cousin. Mr. Guppy has begun following Esther around the city, and she spots him whenever she goes to the theater. He makes her very uncomfortable, but she decides that there is nothing she can do about it. Mr. Kenge's cousin, Mr. Bayham Badger, agrees to oversee Richard's studies. Everyone goes to dinner at Mr. Badger's house. Mr. Badger brags about being Mrs. Badger's third husband, after Captain Swosser and Professor Dingo. Both spouses extol the former husbands liberally throughout dinner. At home later that night, Ada confesses a secret to Esther: she and Richard are in love. Esther isn't surprised at all. Richard confides in her as well, and Esther observes that both really love her. Esther tells the news to Mr. Jarndyce, who approves but advises caution. Offhandedly, Esther remarks that a young surgeon with a dark complexion attended the Badgers' dinner as well and that she found him quite nice", "analysis": "As Bleak House progresses, the layers of secrets grow deeper, and it seems as though nearly every character is hiding something. In chapter 11, for example, Mr. Tulkinghorn stays mysteriously close to the dead lodger's coat, but he never reveals why and we don't know if he takes anything from the coat before leaving. After Nemo's cause-of-death trial, Mr. Snagsby gives little Jo some money and tells him to keep quiet if he ever sees Mr. Snagsby with \"a lady,\" which suggests that Mr. Snagsby has a secret too. In chapter 12, the interactions between Lady Dedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn suggest that something is going on, and the narrator says that Mr. Tulkinghorn \"carries family secrets in every limb of his body.\" In chapter 14, Krook seems \"tormented\" by a secret he holds, though he says nothing. Esther is sometimes the confidante who gets to hear secrets, such as Ada's revelation that she and Richard are in love. Esther has so far proven to be a conscientious narrator, yet beginning in chapter 13, when she casually tells us that she \"omitted to mention\" a young surgeon who attended the Badgers' dinner, she reveals that she may have a secret of her own as well. Although Esther is a thorough narrator, detailed in her descriptions and recollections, she is not necessarily a reliable one. In earlier chapters, she has shown herself to be all too willing to paint herself in a complimentary light, never omitting others' praises or affections for her. In chapter 13, however, when she blatantly neglects to mention the young surgeon at the Badgers' dinner, she shows herself to be unreliable, perhaps more concerned with keeping her own secrets private than with telling the entire story. At the end of chapter 14, she leaves out information again when she tells us that she has not mentioned that the young surgeon is actually Mr. Woodcourt, Miss Flite's doctor. Then, when Ada begins to tease her, Esther simply cuts her off and tells us that what Ada said doesn't matter. Here we begin to see that even though we must rely on Esther to lead us through this meandering tale, we must also understand that she may not be telling us the whole story. Orphaned, courageous children seem to be everywhere in Bleak House, and their presence lends an atmosphere of genuine pathos to the novel. For example, Jo, the street urchin who testifies that the dead lodger was very good to him, is shunned by society and must fend for himself. A man who had shown him kindness is dead, and Jo has no real outlet for his mourning, nor any real way of expressing how he feels. He knows only simple truths, such as that \"a broom's a broom\" and \"it's wicked to tell a lie.\" All he gets in return for his honesty is a coin from Mr. Snagsby, on the condition that he keep quiet if he sees something he shouldn't. The Neckett children are orphans as well, and although they have each other and Mr. Gridley, the brunt of the caretaking falls to young Charlotte. She too values hard work and believes it's the only way to survive. These and other children seem to exist in a bleak universe parallel to the adult world of the novel. Although some of the portraits Dickens draws of children are comical, such as of the put-upon Pardiggle children, more often the children are in genuine distress."}
