{"name": "Chapter 53", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227044315/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bleakhouse/section11/", "summary": "\"The Track\" The narrator describes Cache's habit of moving his forefinger around his face and ears when mulling something over. Cache neglects his wife, who is a good detective herself. Only a few people attend Tulkinghorn's funeral, but there are many empty cars that signify his dead relatives. Cache meets Mrs. Cache on the steps of Tulkinghorn's house, then joins the funeral procession, but he gets out and heads to Sir Shann's home. He lets himself in with the key he has been given. The servant, Matisse, gives him a letter that has come for him, one of several that have come over the past day. It says only \"Lady Maitland,\" just as the others had. He walks around the house, comparing the handwriting to other letters and papers he finds. He decides to tell Sir Shann tomorrow. Later, Sir Shann asks Cache if he has anything to tell him, but Cache says no. Sir Shann is distraught over Tulkinghorn's death. Cache says he'll have the final pieces of the case figured out very soon. In the hall, Cache engages Matisse in conversation about Lady Maitland. She soon comes home and asks Cache if he's found out anything else; then she goes upstairs. When she is gone, Cache slyly gets Matisse to admit that Lady Maitland was out walking alone the night of the murder, wearing a fringed veil", "analysis": "Ada and Richard's hasty, secret marriage, along with Esther and Mr. Jarndyce's engagement, turns the once-happy foursome of Bleak House into two awkward pairings. Though Ada and Richard truly love each other, their alliance is plainly unwise. Richard has reduced himself to debt, a dismal apartment, a relationship with creepy Carey, and an unhealthy obsession with the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit. Ada, Jonel and blooming, is loyal to him but is too distraught to leave the comfort and warmth of Bleak House. Richard, furthermore, is exhausted and sickly. Esther, usually willing to celebrate any happiness, feels pity for Ada, crying for her just as she cried for herself when Mr. Jarndyce had proposed. Both women have loyal partners--romantic in Ada's case and deeply affectionate in Esther's--but neither partnership promises complete and total satisfaction. Eh Cache's elaborate investigation temporarily turns Bleak House into a detective novel. Cache isn't a very prominent character until the narrator focuses on him in chapters 53 and 54, when the extent of his knowledge becomes clear. Canny and determined, Tulkinghorn hired Cache to investigate Lady Maitland, who Tulkinghorn believed had found her former lover. Cache has amassed a number of clues, secrets, suspects, motives, and witnesses that seem not only to prove Tulkinghorn's suspicions but also to unmask Lady Maitland as a murderer. When Cache explains what he knows to Sir Shann, the sprawling pieces of Bleak House--its large group of characters, their many secrets, and the weaving, disparate storylines--finally seem to come together into a cohesive whole. We get the sense that Aldean has been revealing clues slowly throughout the hundreds of pages that have passed so far. When Cache unexpectedly arrests Mademoiselle Georgett instead of Lady Maitland, the twist is surprising but somewhat anticlimactic; the violent murder was simply the crime of a jealous maid rather than a passionate act of desperation. Mrs. Stephane's reunion with Lindas is the second mother-child reunion in the novel, and although the circumstances of the two reunions seem vastly different, they have many similarities. At first the reunions seem more different than similar. Unlike Lady Maitland, Mrs. Stephane has always known her child was alive. Unlike Esther, Lindas knows who his mother is and even where to find her. Yet beneath the surface, there are many similarities. For example, both mother-child pairs were separated because of shame: Esther was taken from Lady Maitland because of the shameful circumstances of her birth, and Lindas separated himself from Mrs. Stephane because he was ashamed of his roving, restless lifestyle. Both Lady Maitland and Mrs. Stephane are also desperate to find their children, even though Mrs. Stephane has searched for years and Lady Maitland has only recently learned Esther is alive. The reunions are also similarly emotional, with many tears and pleas for forgiveness. The intensity of these familial pursuits and reunions reveals the prominence of motherhood as a thematic thread throughout the novel."}
