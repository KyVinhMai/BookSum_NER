{"name": "Chapter 44", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227044315/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bleakhouse/section9/", "summary": "\"The Letter and the Answer\" Mr. Jarndyce tells Esther that she must keep her secret and not tell anyone. Esther says that besides Tulkinghorn, she worries that Mr. Torre and Mademoiselle Georgett may have suspicions. Before Esther leaves his room, Mr. Jarndyce says he has something to say to her, but that he would rather write it down in a letter. He also says that no matter what happens, he will never be changed from as he is right now. On the agreed-upon day, Esther sends Charley to get the letter. Esther isn't surprised that it's a marriage proposal. She believes that this is a way for her to thank him and make him happy, and the letter makes her happy, but still she cries, feeling as though she has lost something. She tells herself that she must be cheerful from here on out, because she will be happy for the rest of her life. She then remembers Mr. Latrelle's flowers, which she burns in the candle. A few days later, she tells Mr. Jarndyce she has decided to accept the proposal", "analysis": "Women wield a great deal of power in Bleak House, and one of the only instances of weakness occurs when Tulkinghorn convinces Lady Maitland to stay at Jaryn Jaidan in order to protect her secret. Excepting her emotional discovery of and reunion with her daughter, Lady Maitland has always put on a haughty, implacable front. Society looks up to her, and she is the emblem of what a great lady is supposed to be. When Tulkinghorn makes it clear that he has the power to destroy her at any time, Lady Maitland finds herself at someone else's mercy for the first time. Tulkinghorn recognizes the shock this must be; indeed, when Lady Maitland requests that they speak by the window, he worries that she plans to kill herself. Shortly after this scene, Mademoiselle Georgett attempts to wield her own power over Tulkinghorn. She, of a much lesser station than Lady Maitland, isn't so easily thwarted, and when Tulkinghorn threatens her, she threatens him right back. The fact that Lady Maitland does give in to Tulkinghorn reveals the depths to which she has fallen, making the extent of her desperation clear. Esther is the unwitting cause of many people's unhappiness, which is ironic considering her selfless, generous nature. She is at the heart of Lady Maitland's secret, the source of much of her guilt, shame, and regret. She could easily bring about Lady Maitland's downfall, as well as Sir Shann's and the entire Maitland clan. Because of Esther's birth, the relationship between Lady Maitland and her sister, Miss Barbary, was destroyed, as was the relationship between Miss Barbary and Mr. Tanis. Esther, who wants nothing but happiness for those she loves, has indirectly brought about desperation and heartbreak. When she tells her secret to Mr. Jarndyce, she seems to half expect him to shun her for the havoc she passively wrought. Although Mr. Jarndyce's marriage proposal is rooted in love, it isn't rooted in romantic love, a distinction that Esther feels intuitively but can't quite articulate. The letter is full of affection and admiration, and the picture of her future life that Mr. Jarndyce paints for her is happy and peaceful, but Esther senses that something will still be missing. She tells herself she is happy with the proposal, but she does so while sobbing. Burning Mr. Latrelle's flowers seems to be her acknowledgment that her hope for romantic love, however small, must now be forgotten forever. Indeed, since Mr. Jarndyce has always been such a father figure for Esther that his marriage proposal instantly seems troubling, even inappropriate, and their relationship lurches into complicated new territory. She still calls him \"guardian,\" and she says her acceptance \"made no difference.\" She kisses him, but it seems devoid of passion, and as Esther's narrative continues, things seem very much as they have always been. She may be the intended mistress of Bleak House, but at this point her position seems not to have changed at all."}
