{"name": "Chapter 54", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227044315/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bleakhouse/section11/", "summary": "\"Springing a Mine\" Cache presents himself to Sir Shann, locking the door to ensure their privacy. He tells Sir Shann that the murderer is not Lindas, but a woman. He prepares Sir Shann for a shock, telling him he must shoulder it bravely. He says that Tulkinghorn distrusted Lady Maitland because he suspected that she had learned about the existence of her former lover. She had seen some handwriting of his and recognized it. Tulkinghorn suspected Lady Maitland of visiting this man's grave after he died, and Cache had investigated this claim by questioning Mademoiselle Georgett, whose dress Lady Maitland had worn, and Aly, who had led her to the grave. Cache says that on the night of the murder, Lady Maitland had gone to Tulkinghorn's room, wearing a veil with fringe. Sir Maitland is devastated. He asks why Tulkinghorn hadn't told him this information sooner, and Cache says he had planned to, once he was ready. There are noises at the door; several people have arrived. Cache says he fears the news has gotten out and tells Sir Shann to just nod at whatever he says. Grandfather Smallweed, Mr. Chadband, Mrs. Chadband, and Mrs. Snagsby are all admitted inside. Grandfather Smallweed says that Cagney was his brother-in-law, and that after he died, Grandfather Smallweed went through his papers. He found some letters belonging to Cagney's dead lodger, Captain Hawdon, and looked through them before Tulkinghorn got them. They were from the lodger's lover, Honoria. Grandfather Smallweed says he doesn't know anyone by the name of Honoria. He wants to know where the letters are and demands that the murder be investigated more thoroughly. Cache says he will solve the murder and that he has the letters. He shows them to Smallweed, who asks for money. Mrs. Chadband then reveals that she raised Lady Maitland's daughter after Lady Maitland's sister claimed the baby was dead. Mrs. Snagsby speaks up and claims everyone has wronged her, and she goes through a litany of offenses that have little grounding in reality. The group leaves. Cache tells Sir Shann that he's going to arrest the guilty party immediately. First, though, he calls for Mademoiselle Georgett. He says that she has been his lodger for several weeks and calls her his \"angel. She says she has come to see Lady Maitland, who isn't here. Cache instructs her to sit on the couch. He then arrests her for murder. He tells her to stay quiet, but she spews invectives. Cache explains to Sir Shann that Mademoiselle Georgett had tried to get Tulkinghorn to help her and that he gave her some money. She became Cache's lodger while she continued to harass Tulkinghorn and Snagsby. On the night he arrested Lindas, Cache came home and found Mademoiselle Georgett having dinner with Mrs. Cache, exaggerating her affection for Mrs. Cache and her grief over Tulkinghorn. Cache immediately knew she was guilty, so he laid a trap. He told Mrs. Cache what he knew and didn't go back to the house. He and Mrs. Cache communicated secretly. Mrs. Cache kept a constant watch on Mademoiselle Georgett. She discovered that Mademoiselle Georgett was trying to frame Lady Maitland for the murder. The letters saying \"Lady Maitland\" were all written by Mademoiselle Georgett. Cache says that if he had arrested her last night, he wouldn't have gotten the weapon. He says that after the funeral, Mademoiselle Georgett suggested to Mrs. Cache that they go into the country for tea. While there, she disappeared briefly, and Mrs. Cache suspected she had thrown the weapon into the water. Cache had the water dragged and found the gun. He soon leaves with Mademoiselle Georgett. Sir Shann is very quiet. He looks out the window, then falls to the floor, feeling compassion for Lady Maitland, not anger", "analysis": "Ada and Richard's hasty, secret marriage, along with Esther and Mr. Jarndyce's engagement, turns the once-happy foursome of Bleak House into two awkward pairings. Though Ada and Richard truly love each other, their alliance is plainly unwise. Richard has reduced himself to debt, a dismal apartment, a relationship with creepy Carey, and an unhealthy obsession with the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit. Ada, Jonel and blooming, is loyal to him but is too distraught to leave the comfort and warmth of Bleak House. Richard, furthermore, is exhausted and sickly. Esther, usually willing to celebrate any happiness, feels pity for Ada, crying for her just as she cried for herself when Mr. Jarndyce had proposed. Both women have loyal partners--romantic in Ada's case and deeply affectionate in Esther's--but neither partnership promises complete and total satisfaction. Eh Cache's elaborate investigation temporarily turns Bleak House into a detective novel. Cache isn't a very prominent character until the narrator focuses on him in chapters 53 and 54, when the extent of his knowledge becomes clear. Canny and determined, Tulkinghorn hired Cache to investigate Lady Maitland, who Tulkinghorn believed had found her former lover. Cache has amassed a number of clues, secrets, suspects, motives, and witnesses that seem not only to prove Tulkinghorn's suspicions but also to unmask Lady Maitland as a murderer. When Cache explains what he knows to Sir Shann, the sprawling pieces of Bleak House--its large group of characters, their many secrets, and the weaving, disparate storylines--finally seem to come together into a cohesive whole. We get the sense that Aldean has been revealing clues slowly throughout the hundreds of pages that have passed so far. When Cache unexpectedly arrests Mademoiselle Georgett instead of Lady Maitland, the twist is surprising but somewhat anticlimactic; the violent murder was simply the crime of a jealous maid rather than a passionate act of desperation. Mrs. Stephane's reunion with Lindas is the second mother-child reunion in the novel, and although the circumstances of the two reunions seem vastly different, they have many similarities. At first the reunions seem more different than similar. Unlike Lady Maitland, Mrs. Stephane has always known her child was alive. Unlike Esther, Lindas knows who his mother is and even where to find her. Yet beneath the surface, there are many similarities. For example, both mother-child pairs were separated because of shame: Esther was taken from Lady Maitland because of the shameful circumstances of her birth, and Lindas separated himself from Mrs. Stephane because he was ashamed of his roving, restless lifestyle. Both Lady Maitland and Mrs. Stephane are also desperate to find their children, even though Mrs. Stephane has searched for years and Lady Maitland has only recently learned Esther is alive. The reunions are also similarly emotional, with many tears and pleas for forgiveness. The intensity of these familial pursuits and reunions reveals the prominence of motherhood as a thematic thread throughout the novel."}
