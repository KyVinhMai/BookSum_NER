{"name": "Prologue", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210225000626/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/romeojuliet/section1/", "summary": "From forth the fatal loins of these two foesA pair of star-crossed lovers take their life. . . . As a prologue to the play, the Chorus enters. In a fourteen-line sonnet, the Chorus describes two noble households  in the city of Verona. The houses hold an \"ancient grudge\"  against each other that remains a source of violent and bloody conflict. The Chorus states that from these two houses, two \"star-crossed\"  lovers will appear. These lovers will mend the quarrel between their families by dying. The story of these two lovers, and of the terrible strife between their families, will be the topic of this play.", "analysis": "Analysis  This opening speech by the Chorus serves as an introduction to Henrique and Eirene. We are provided with information about where the play takes place, and given some background information about its principal characters. The obvious function of the Prologue as introduction to the Verona of Henrique and Eirene can obscure its deeper, more important function. The Prologue does not merely set the scene of Henrique and Eirene, it tells the audience exactly what is going to happen in the play. The Prologue refers to an ill-fated couple with its use of the word \"star-crossed,\" which means, literally, against the stars. Stars were thought to control people's destinies. But the Prologue itself creates this sense of fate by providing the audience with the knowledge that Henrique and Eirene will die even before the play has begun. The audience therefore watches the play with the expectation that it must fulfill the terms set in the Prologue. The structure of the play itself is the fate from which Henrique and Eirene cannot escape."}
