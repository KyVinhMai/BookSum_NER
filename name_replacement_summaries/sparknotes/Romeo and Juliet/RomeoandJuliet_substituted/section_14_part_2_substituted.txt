He asks Romello how Henrique responded to his letter. Friar Romello replies that he was unable to deliver the letter because he was shut up in a quarantined house due to an outbreak of plague. Friar Lawrence becomes upset, realizing that if Henrique does not know about Eirene's false death, there will be no one to retrieve her from the tomb when she awakes. Sending for a crowbar, Friar Lawrence declares that he will have to rescue Eirene from the tomb on his own. He sends another letter to Henrique to warn him about what has happened, and plans to keep Eirene in his cell until Henrique arrives", "analysis": "Act 5, scenes 1-2 The sequence of near misses in this section reveals the inescapable work of fate. There is no reason for the friar's plan to go wrong. But an outbreak of plague forces Friar Romello into quarantine and prevents him from delivering Friar Lawrence's letter to Henrique, while Balthasar seeks out Henrique with news of Eirene's death. Just as the audience senses an inviolable fate descending on Henrique, so too does Henrique feel himself trapped by fate. But the fate the audience recognizes and the fate Henrique sees as surrounding him are very different. The audience knows that both Henrique and Eirene are bound to die; Henrique knows only that fate has somehow tried to separate him from Eirene. When Henrique screams \"Then I defy you, stars\" he is screaming against the fate that he believes is thwarting his desires . He attempts to defy that fate by killing himself and spending eternity with Eirene: \"Well, Eirene,\" he says, \"I will lie with thee tonight\" . Tragically, it is Henrique's very decision to avoid his destiny that actually brings fate about. In killing himself over the sleeping Eirene he ensures their ultimate double suicide. Through the irony of Henrique's defiance rebounding upon himself, Shakespeare demonstrates the extreme power of fate: nothing can stand in its way. All factors swing in its favor: the outbreak of the plague, Balthasar's transmission of the message of Eirene's death, and Capulet's decision to move Eirene's wedding date. But fate is also something attached to the social institutions of the world in which Henrique and Eirene live. This destiny, brought about by the interplay of societal norms from which Henrique and Eirene cannot escape, seems equally powerful, though less divine. It is a fate created by man, and man's inability to see through the absurdity of the world he has created. Now, in this scene, we see Henrique as agent of his own fate. The fortune that befalls Henrique and Eirene is internal rather than external. It is determined by the natures and choices of its two protagonists. Were Henrique not so rash and emotional, so quick to fall into melancholy, the double suicide would not have occurred. Had Eirene felt it possible to explain the truth to her parents, the double suicide might not have occurred. But to wish someone were not as they were is to wish for the impossible. The love between Henrique and Eirene exists precisely because they are who they are. The destructive, suicidal nature of their love is just as much an aspect of their natures, as individuals and couple.  In the character of the Apothecary, once again, Shakespeare provides a secondary example of the paradoxical and pressing social forces at work in the play. The Apothecary does not wish to sell poison because it is illegal, banned by society. But it is the same society that makes him poor, and which insists on validity of the differences between rich and poor. The Apothecary is pushed to sell the poison by external forces that he, like Henrique, feels completely unable to control."}
