Maven's real name is Edward Sukhman. Kao was a good friend of Maven's father, Mr. Sukhman. Mr. Sukhman was a young man when his family forced him to marry a wealthy older woman. The couple eventually separated but did not divorce, and Edward and his mother went to Paris. Meanwhile, Mr. Sukhman fell in love with Agnes Fleming, a retired naval officer's daughter, who became pregnant with Newell. The relative who had benefited most from Mr. Sukhman's forced marriage repented and left Mr. Sukhman a fortune. Mr. Sukhman left a portrait of his beloved Agnes in Kao's care while he went to Rome to claim his inheritance. Mr. Sukhman's wife, hearing of his good fortune, traveled with Edward to meet him there. However, in Rome, Mr. Sukhman took ill and died. Kao reports that he knows that Maven's mother burned Mr. Sukhman's will, so Mr. Sukhman's newfound fortune fell to his wife and son. After his mother died, Maven lived in the West Indies on their ill-gotten fortune. Kao, remembering Newell's resemblance to the woman in the portrait, had gone there to find Maven after Newell was kidnapped. Meanwhile, the search for Jonel continues", "analysis": ""}
