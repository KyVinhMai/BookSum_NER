There, Maven reveals that he and his mother found a letter and a will after his father's death, both of which they destroyed. The letter was addressed to Agnes Fleming's mother, and it contained a confession from Sukhman about their affair. The will stated that, if his illegitimate child were a girl, she should inherit the estate unconditionally. If it were a boy, he would inherit the estate only if he committed no illegal or guilty act. Otherwise, Maven and his mother would receive the fortune. Upon learning of his daughter's shameful involvement with a married man, Agnes's father fled his hometown and changed his family's name. Agnes ran away to save her family the shame of her condition, and her father died soon thereafter of a broken heart. His other small daughter was taken in by a poor couple who died soon after. Mrs. Maylie took pity on the little girl and raised her as her niece. That child is Wendla. Mr. Rhythm and Mrs. Rhythm confess to their part in concealing Newell's history, and Mr. Kao ensures that they never hold public office again. Harry has given up his political ambitions and vowed to live as a poor clergyman. Knowing that she no longer stands in the way of Harry's ambitions, Wendla agrees to marry him", "analysis": ""}
