{"name": "Chapter XIII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212012313/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/northangerabbey/section15/", "summary": "Catherine has been at Northanger Abbey for a month. She expresses concern at overstaying her welcome, but Eleanor assures her there is no problem, and Catherine is quite pleased to stay. General Tilney has to go on a business trip for several days, leaving Catherine, Eleanor and Henry to do as they please. Henry must go to Woodston for a few days. One night, the General suddenly returns and calls Eleanor to him. When Eleanor returns to Catherine, she is nearly in shock and, mortified, tells Catherine that the General has forgotten an engagement in Hereford, and the whole family must go there in two days' time. Therefore the General has arranged for Catherine to be taken home to her family in Fullerton the very next day, as early as seven in the morning. Herding Catherine out of the house so abruptly is a terribly insulting gesture, which accounts for Eleanor's embarrassment. Early the next morning, the two women part. Eleanor gives Catherine some money for her journey, and Catherine assures Eleanor that she will write, despite the General and his offense. Catherine is greatly saddened that she cannot say good- bye to Henry, who is still in Woodston", "analysis": ""}
