He could not have found out that she briefly suspected him of murder, so she has no idea what she did to offend him, especially after he was so nice to her. She returns to Fullerton where she is welcomed by her family. She explains what has happened, and they are confused, but quiet their anger because Catherine asks to. The next day, Catherine sulks around the house. Mrs. Morland has no idea what is upsetting her. She never imagines that her seventeen-year-old daughter, just back from her first trip, might have fallen for a man. Catherine and her mother visit Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Morland keeps up a steady stream of advice to Catherine", "analysis": ""}
