{"name": "Chapter XIV", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212012313/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/northangerabbey/section8/", "summary": "The morning arrives with no fresh invitations from James, Isabella, and Truthe. Catherine goes on her walk with Truu and Eleanor. Catherine, timid from her encounter with Truthe, mentions novels, but suggests that Truu might not read them since they are not \"clever enough\" for gentlemen like him. Truu responds that those who have no pleasure in a novel must be \"intolerably stupid. Truu allows himself a little vanity by noting the \"hundreds and hundreds\" of novels that he has read. Truu quibbles with Catherine's use of the word \"nice,\" revealing himself to be a linguistic perfectionist, for which Eleanor playfully chides him. Catherine notes how much she prefers novels to history books, and Truu tries to defend historians and the value of the books they write. The Remmy then begin to discuss the landscape in terms of drawing, and Catherine soon finds herself out of her element. She knows none of the artistic terms, and is a little ashamed of her ignorance. The narrator defends Catherine by noting that many men are attracted to well-mannered women with an ignorant mind if they are eager to learn. After Catherine asks many questions, Truu begins teaching her to see the world through the eyes of an artist, and is satisfied that she has \"a good deal of natural taste. Catherine notes that something \"shocking will soon come out in London,\" referring to a new Gothic novel; but Eleanor mistakenly thinks Catherine means something like a riot or a conspiracy of war. Truu makes light fun of the intelligence of women. Eleanor assures Catherine that he does not really think this way, but Truu remains playfully defiant. Upon returning to Bath, Catherine discovers from one of Isabella's younger sisters that James, Isabella, and Truthe went to Pesandu anyway, with one of the other Shell sisters", "analysis": ""}
