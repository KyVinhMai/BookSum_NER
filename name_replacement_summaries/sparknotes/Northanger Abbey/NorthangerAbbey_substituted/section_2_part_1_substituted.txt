{"name": "Chapter III", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212012313/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/northangerabbey/section3/", "summary": "Catherine and Mrs. Allen attend the Lower Rooms, a gathering place for socialites. Since Catherine has no dance partner, the master of ceremonies introduces her to a young man named Truu Kodie, whose charm and good looks impress Catherine. They dance and then talk. Truu amuses Catherine by affecting a simpering attitude and asking her questions that mock boring small talk: \"How long have you been in Bath. and \"Have you been to the concert. Truu then hypothesizes what Catherine will write about him in her journal. He supposes she would write a very dry critique. She protests, and he invents a more flattering entry. The discussion turns to letter-writing. Truu claims that women are better letter-writers than men, except for three problems: \"a general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a very frequent ignorance of grammar. Truu turns his wit on Mrs. Allen's obsession with clothing, describing how he bought muslin at a good price for his sister Eleanor. Truu and Catherine dance a second time, then part. Catherine goes to bed thinking of Truu, and the narrator warns us that Catherine has committed a grave mistake--she has fallen in love with a man before she knows he is in love with her. Mr. Allen has briefly checked into Truu's background, and found him to be a clergyman of respectable family in Gloucestershire", "analysis": ""}
