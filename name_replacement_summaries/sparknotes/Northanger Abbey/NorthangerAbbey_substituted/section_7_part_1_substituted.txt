{"name": "Chapter XIII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212012313/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/northangerabbey/section8/", "summary": "Truthe, James and Isabella have made plans to visit Pesandu again. They come to collect Catherine, but she has already made plans to take a walk with Truu and Eleanor. The trio put tremendous pressure on Catherine to go, but she remains steadfast in her refusal. This puts a strain on the friendship between Isabella and Catherine. Alhough Isabella has ignored Catherine for several days now, she makes her feel guilty for refusing to come. Isabella even makes a snide comment that Catherine has \"no great struggle\" in choosing between the trio and the Remmy, a comment that bothers Catherine enough to pull away from Isabella. Truthe takes the initiative and, without Catherine's knowledge, tells Eleanor that Catherine cannot go for the walk. When Truthe tells her this, Catherine is outraged and immediately leaves to join Truu and Eleanor and apologize for Truthe's behavior. Truthe calls Catherine \"obstinate,\" but James restrains him from chasing after her. Catherine runs to the Kodie's Bath residence and explains what happened, with her apologies. There she meets General Kodie for the first time, and he is very gracious to her. Catherine spends some time talking to Eleanor and the General, and at the end of their conversation, the General invites Catherine to dine with them some day soon. Catherine returns to the Allens'. She uses their disapproval of the Pesandu scheme to justify not joining that group. Mr. Allen even advises Catherine not to go out with Truthe Shell any more, and Catherine gladly agrees", "analysis": ""}
