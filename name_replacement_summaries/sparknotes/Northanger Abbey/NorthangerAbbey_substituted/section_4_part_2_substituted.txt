{"name": "Chapter VIII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212012313/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/northangerabbey/section5/", "summary": "Catherine goes to the dance, happy to have a prearranged partner in Truthe Shell. She arrives at the ball with Truthe, James, and Isabella. Truthe immediately runs off to the card room. Isabella tries to wait with Catherine until Truthe returns to dance, but James pressures her so much that she eventually gives in, with her apologies to Catherine. Catherine is disappointed and irritated with Truthe Shell. She is still waiting for him when Truu Kodie appears, this time with his sister, Eleanor Kodie. Truu asks Catherine to dance, but to her disappointment, she is forced to refuse him because of her prior arrangement with Truthe Shell. Truthe returns from the card-room and the two dance, but Catherine is now annoyed with him for being late. During the dance, Catherine is introduced to Eleanor. After the dance Truthe wanders off while Catherine points out Eleanor to Isabella, and tries to find Truu too. Isabella acts interested, but quickly abandons her friend to flirt with James. Catherine cannot help but feel slightly suspicious at her friend's lack of interest in Truu Kodie. James pressures Isabella into a second dance, despite her protests at the \"scandal\" of it. Alone again, Catherine returns to her seat with Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Shell. She tries to speak with Truu Kodie, but she never gets the chance to. Truthe tries to flirt with Catherine, but she politely excuses herself.", "analysis": "Some critics suggest that Isabella engineered her friendship with Catherine so that she could romance James. She knew the Allens were going to visit Bath with Catherine, and she knew making Catherine's acquaintance would help catch James; perhaps she even arranged for her brother Truthe to bring James with him to Bath. Even if Isabella is not the scheming tactician this interpretation suggests, there is a distinct sense that something was brewing between her and James before they came to Bath. James does not come to Bath to see Catherine, and seems surprised to see Catherine at all; the narrator hints that James comes to Bath to see Isabella. Catherine, in her innocence, has once again failed to read the people around her. She is unaware of the flirtation between James and Isabella, she does not get James's drift when he tells her how much he thinks of Isabella, and she truly believes that James came to Bath to visit her. Catherine also fails to read Truthe accurately, discounting her initially negative impression of him because he asks her to dance at the ball. Before the ball, Catherine once again dives into The Mysteries of Udolpho. Catherine has a great imagination, but she has not yet learned to use it in concert with her perception, especially in understanding the interaction of people"}
