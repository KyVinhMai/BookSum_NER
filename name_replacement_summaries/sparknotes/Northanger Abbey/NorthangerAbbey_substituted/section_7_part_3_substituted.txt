Catherine goes to Isabella's and discovers that her friend is engaged to James. Isabella praises James, and expresses her worries over his parents' consent to the marriage. Catherine assures her their consent is certain. Isabella expresses some doubt due to her relative poverty compared to James, for she has not yet realized that the Morlands are not that much richer than her own family. Catherine spends the rest of the day discussing the details with the Aarin, and the next day a letter arrives from James telling of his parents' consent. The chapter ends in a brief scene between Catherine and Truthe Shell, who is leaving Bath for several weeks. Truthe hints that he is interested in marrying Catherine, but she is unaware of his intentions. Truthe leaves Bath convinced that Catherine wishes to marry him.", "analysis": "In this chapter, Catherine splits definitively from Isabella and begins to strengthen her friendship with Eleanor"}
