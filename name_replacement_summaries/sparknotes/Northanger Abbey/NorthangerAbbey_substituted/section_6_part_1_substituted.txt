{"name": "Chapter XI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212012313/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/northangerabbey/section7/", "summary": "An early morning rain prevents Catherine's scheduled walk with Eleanor and Truu Kodie. Around noon, Truthe Shell, Isabella, and James show up at her door again, with a plan to visit Bristol. Catherine refuses at first, thinking that Eleanor and Truu may still show up, but Truthe entices her by telling her they will visit a castle and in any case, he saw Truu Kodie driving away in a carriage earlier that morning. Catherine joins them, somewhat reluctantly. As they leave Bath, Truthe points out a girl staring at Catherine, and Catherine is startled to see Truu and Eleanor walking toward her house. She begs Truthe to turn the cart around, but he refuses. She becomes passive and indifferent to him for the rest of the ride. Eventually, Isabella wants to return to Bath without seeing the castle, and Truthe angrily turns his carriage back. The night is spent at the Aarin, where Isabella and James continue to fawn over each other, and Catherine sulks. Isabella talks endlessly about how happy she is not to be at that night's ball, in a way that suggests she wishes she were there. Isabella offers Catherine little consolation for the Kodie incident, and the chapter ends with the narrator comparing Catherine's loss to the plight of a great heroine, consigning her to \"a sleepless couch, which is the true heroine's portion", "analysis": ""}
