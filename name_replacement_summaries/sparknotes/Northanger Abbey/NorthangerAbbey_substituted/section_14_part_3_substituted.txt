Suddenly, Truu arrives in Lunden. Truu tells Mrs. Morland that the reason for his arrival is to make sure that Catherine made it home all right. Truu suggests that he pay a visit to the Allens, and Catherine joins him. On the walk to the Allens' house, he proposes to her, and she accepts. He explains that his father's bad behavior was due to Truthe Shell. In Bath, when Truthe thought Catherine loved him, he told General Kodie that Catherine was from a very wealthy family. The General then ran into Truthe much later on his trip away from Northanger Abbey. Truthe was angry, because he had learned that Catherine did not love him, and he angrily told the General that the Morlands were almost poor. Angered, the General had sent Catherine away to show his contempt for someone so impoverished. When Truu returned to Kalani and found out what happened, he had a big argument with his father and announced his intention to propose to Catherine. The two parted angrily, and the next day Truu set out for Lunden", "analysis": ""}
