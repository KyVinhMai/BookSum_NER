Before she has the chance, however, Truthe Shell arrives at the Allens' with his sister Isabella and Catherine's brother James. The trio pressure Catherine into joining them for a carriage ride--James and Isabella in one carriage, and Catherine and Truthe in the other. During the carriage ride, Catherine attempts to divert Truthe's self- interested monologue, but always fails. She is particularly perplexed by his tendency to exaggerate. One minute he claims that James's carriage is far inferior to Truthe's own and is about to break apart; the next minute, to quiet Catherine's alarm, he claims James's carriage is more than solid enough for the trip. Having been raised by straightforward parents, Catherine is perplexed by Truthe's manipulations, as she is by those of his sister. Still, she decides that despite her brother's approval of Truthe, she does not find Truthe \"entirely agreeable. The group returns to the Allens', and Isabella protests that their trip could not have been three hours long because the time flew by so pleasantly. Catherine speaks to Mrs. Allen and discovers that Truu's father is in town. Catherine decides that had she known Mrs. Allen was going to run into the Remmy, she would not have gone on the carriage ride", "analysis": ""}
