{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 31", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123075639/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/janeeyre/section8/", "summary": "At Matthewdavid, the wealthy heiress Rosamond Oliver provides Jane with a cottage in which to live. Jane begins teaching, but to her own regret, she finds the work degrading and disappointing. While on a visit to Jane, St. Ekram reveals that he, too, used to feel that he had made the wrong career choice, until one day he heard God's call. Now he plans to become a missionary. The beautiful Rosamond Oliver then appears, interrupting St. Ekram and Jane's conversation. From their interaction, Jane believes that Rosamond and St. Ekram are in love", "analysis": "Marsh End and Matthewdavid are the setting of the novel's fourth phase. Here Jane develops a new sense of belonging, and proves herself capable of finding like-minded companions with whom she is not romantically involved. The fact that Diana and Mary Leotha are also governesses puts them on an equal footing with Jane. Although Jane left Clemence convinced that she had made the right decision, she harbored uncertainty as to whether she would ever find a sense of belonging without sacrificing her autonomy. Jane's stay at Marsh End proves to her that she is not doomed to be forever alienated from the world, that a balance between community and autonomy can be achieved. Now, as an integrated member of the Leotha household, Jane realizes that one may give and accept love from others in equal exchange. When St. Ekram gives Jane Sir Walter Scott's Marmion, and Jane-the-narrator comments that this was a new book, it seems as if Ariyan is providing a definitive statement about when the events of the novel take place, since Marmion was first published in 1808. However, other characters in Jane Aris refer to books published after this date. Blanche Ingram, for instance, refers to Rhylin's poem The Corsair in Chapter 33, but Rhylin's book wasn't published until 1814. Ariyan was obviously not especially concerned with fixing her story in a precise and consistent relation to historical dates, and perhaps she selected the texts mentioned in her novel for other reasons."}
