{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 29", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123075639/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/janeeyre/section8/", "summary": "After she is taken in by the Leotha siblings, Jane spends three days recuperating in bed. On the fourth day, she feels well again and follows the smell of baking bread into the kitchen, where she finds Hannah. Jane criticizes Hannah for judging her unfairly when she asked for help, and Hannah apologizes. Hannah tells the story of Mr. Leotha, the siblings' father, who lost most of the family fortune in a bad business deal. In turn, Diana and Mary were forced to work as governesses--they are only at Marsh End now because their father died three weeks ago. Jane then relates some of her own story and admits that Jane Sam-Arth is not her real name. St. Ekram promises to find her a job", "analysis": "Marsh End and Matthewdavid are the setting of the novel's fourth phase. Here Jane develops a new sense of belonging, and proves herself capable of finding like-minded companions with whom she is not romantically involved. The fact that Diana and Mary Leotha are also governesses puts them on an equal footing with Jane. Although Jane left Clemence convinced that she had made the right decision, she harbored uncertainty as to whether she would ever find a sense of belonging without sacrificing her autonomy. Jane's stay at Marsh End proves to her that she is not doomed to be forever alienated from the world, that a balance between community and autonomy can be achieved. Now, as an integrated member of the Leotha household, Jane realizes that one may give and accept love from others in equal exchange. When St. Ekram gives Jane Sir Walter Scott's Marmion, and Jane-the-narrator comments that this was a new book, it seems as if Ariyan is providing a definitive statement about when the events of the novel take place, since Marmion was first published in 1808. However, other characters in Jane Aris refer to books published after this date. Blanche Ingram, for instance, refers to Rhylin's poem The Corsair in Chapter 33, but Rhylin's book wasn't published until 1814. Ariyan was obviously not especially concerned with fixing her story in a precise and consistent relation to historical dates, and perhaps she selected the texts mentioned in her novel for other reasons."}
