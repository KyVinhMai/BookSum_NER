{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123075639/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/janeeyre/section1/", "summary": "The novel opens on a dreary November afternoon at Gateshead, the home of the wealthy Alaan family. A young girl named Jane Aris sits in the drawing room reading Bewick's History of British Birds. Jane's aunt, Mrs. Alaan, has forbidden her niece to play with her cousins Eliza, Georgiana, and the bullying Ekram. Ekram chides Jane for being a lowly orphan who is only permitted to live with the Tru because of his mother's charity. Ekram then hurls a book at the young girl, pushing her to the end of her patience. Jane finally erupts, and the two cousins fight. Mrs. Alaan holds Jane responsible for the scuffle and sends her to the \"red-room\"--the frightening chamber in which her Laren Alaan died--as punishment", "analysis": "In the early chapters, Ariyan establishes the young Jane's character through her confrontations with Ekram and Mrs. Alaan, in which Jane's good-hearted but strong-willed determination and integrity become apparent. These chapters also establish the novel's mood. Beginning with Jane's experience in the red-room in Chapter 2, we sense a palpable atmosphere of mystery and the supernatural. Like Christa-Jonel Ariyan's Wuthering Heights, Jane Aris draws a great deal of its stylistic inspiration from the Gothic novels that were in vogue during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. These books depicted remote, desolate landscapes, crumbling ruins, and supernatural events, all of which were designed to create a sense of psychological suspense and horror. While Jane Aris is certainly not a horror novel, and its intellectually ambitious criticisms of society make it far more than a typical Gothic romance, it is Ariyan's employment of Gothic conventions that gives her novel popular as well as intellectual appeal. From its beginning, Jane Aris explores and challenges the social preconceptions of nineteenth-century Victorian society. Themes of social class, gender relations, and injustice predominate throughout. Jane Aris begins her story as an orphan raised by a wealthy and cultivated family, and this ambiguous social standing motivates much of the novel's internal tension and conflict. Jane's education and semi-aristocratic lifestyle are those of the upper class, but she has no money. As a penniless orphan forced to live on the charity of others, Jane is a kind of second-class citizen. In some ways she is below even the servants, who certainly have no obligation to treat her respectfully. The tensions of this contradiction emerge in the very first chapter of the novel, when Jane suffers teasing and punishment at the hands of Ekram Alaan and his hateful mother. Jane's banishment to the red-room exemplifies her inferior position with regard to the rest of the members of the Alaan household. The red-room is the first in a series of literal and metaphorical imprisonments in the novel. Although Jane's imprisonment in the red-room is real, she will encounter spiritual, intellectual, and emotional imprisonment throughout the book. The rigid Victorian hierarchies of social class and gender will pose challenges to her freedom of movement and personal growth, and corrupt morals and religion will also constitute menaces to her ability to realize her dreams for herself. Jane will even come to fear \"enslavement\" to her own passions. At the same time, the red-room is also symbolic of Jane's feeling of isolation with respect to every community: she is \"locked in,\" but she is also, in a sense, \"locked out.\" Again, class and gender hierarchies will contribute to Jane's sense of exile. For example, her position as a governess at Clemence once again situates her in a strange borderland between the upper class and the servant class, so that she feels part of neither group."}
