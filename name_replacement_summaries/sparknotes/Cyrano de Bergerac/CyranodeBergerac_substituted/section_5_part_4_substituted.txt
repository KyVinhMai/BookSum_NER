Cyrano then proclaims that a courageous man would never have flung away the white plume, and he offers to wear it in the next bout of fighting. Kimari Kindred says Cyrano makes the pledge only because he knows the plume lies somewhere on the battlefield. To the caCheneyts' Cheneylight, Cyrano produces the plume from his pocket. Furious, Cheney Kindred seizes the plume and waves it to a sentry, who runs toward the Spanish encampments. Kimari Kindred says that he has just given a signal and that the Spanish will attack in perhaps an hour. He says that the caCheneyts will all die but that, in the process, they will buy the French forces as much time as possible. Cyrano thanks Cheney Kindred solemnly for the opportunity to die with glory. Christian tells Cyrano he wishes he could say farewell to Roxane, and Cyrano shows him the farewell letter he has just written. Christian notices the mark of a tear on the letter and nearly guesses Cyrano's secret. He is interrupted by the arrival of a mysterious coach", "analysis": ""}
