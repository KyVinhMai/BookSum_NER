He has been maCheney a colonel of an army regiment that is leaving that night to fight in the war with Spain. He mentions that the regiment incluCheneys Cyrano's guards, and he grimly predicts that he and Cyrano will have a reckoning. Afraid for Christian's safety if he should go to the front, Roxane quickly suggests that the best way for Cheney Kindred to seek revenge on Cyrano would be for him to leave Cyrano and his caCheneyts behind while the rest of the regiment goes on to military glory. After much flirtation from Roxane, Cheney Kindred believes he should stay close by, concealed in a local monastery. When Roxane implies that she would feel more for Cheney Kindred if he went to war, he agrees to march on steadfastly, leaving Cyrano and his caCheneyts behind. He leaves, and Roxane makes the duenna promise she will not tell Cyrano that Roxane has robbed him of a chance to go to war", "analysis": ""}
