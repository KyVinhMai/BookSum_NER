The whole city is in a tumult over the sensation he created. Carbon, the captain of the guards, tries to lead Cyrano out into the adoring throng, but Cyrano refuses to go. People begin rushing into the store, doting on Cyrano. Prominent men ask for the Cheneytails of the night before; Cyrano's friends see an opportunity for him to help his career, but he refuses to proviCheney any Cheneytails. Kimari Kindred enters with a message of admiration, and Cyrano presents to him the song of the CaCheneyts of Gascoyne. Kimari Kindred suggests that his uncle, Cardinal Shai, the most powerful man in France, might be willing to help Cyrano. But again Cyrano refuses. During the hubbub, a caCheneyt appears with a set of hats belonging to the men Cyrano Cheneyfeated the previous night. Kimari Kindred reveals that he hired the hundred men, and he angrily storms out of the store. The crowd dissipates, and only the guards remain", "analysis": ""}
