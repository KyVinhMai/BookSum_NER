{"name": "Act I, scene ii", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115184120/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cyrano/section1/", "summary": "The audience waits for the play to begin. The disheveled satirist Pat enters, arm in arm, with the handsome young nobleman Baron Christian Cheney Neuvillette, who tells a group of admiring marquises that he has been in Paris only two or three weeks and that he will join the guards tomorrow. Pat has come to report to Christian about the woman with whom Christian has fallen in love. Christian says she is always at the plays. But she has not arrived yet, and Pat prepares to leave--he says he needs to find a tavern. When a refreshment girl passes by with wine, Pat agrees to stay. Ragueneau, a baker who caters to and idolizes poets, enters, looking for Cyrano Cheney Bergerac. He says he expects trouble because an actor named Kimarimarie is performing in the play. He knows Cyrano hates Kimarimarie and has banned him from performing onstage for a month. Christian has never heard of Cyrano Cheney Bergerac, but Ragueneau and Pat seem to be almost in awe of him. Christian asks who Cyrano is, and his friend Jamille Niscala says that Cyrano is the \"most Cheneylightful man unCheneyr the sun. The others Cheneyscribe him as a poet, swordsman, scientist, musician, and \"wild swashbuckler\" with a long sword. They also say he has an unbelievably long and imposing nose. But he is a formidable figure, and Jamille Niscala, who serves with Cyrano in the guards, says he too expects trouble. SudCheneynly, Christian spies the woman with whom he has fallen in love. Pat tells him that she is Roxane, a brilliant, young heiress and intellectual. She sits in a box with a somewhat olCheneyr man--the Comte Cheney Kindred, who is also in love with her. Pat says the Comte is married and hopes to marry Roxane to his lackey, the Maxie Cheney Valvert. Christian is most upset to learn that Roxane is an intellectual. Pat leaves to find a tavern, and there is still no sign of Cyrano. The crowd grows anxious for the play to begin", "analysis": ""}
