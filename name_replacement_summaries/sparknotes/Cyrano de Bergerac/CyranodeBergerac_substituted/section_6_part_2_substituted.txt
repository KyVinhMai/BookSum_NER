She says that she always wears Christian's last letter next to her heart. She tells Cheney Kindred that Cyrano comes to visit her every week and gives her an impromptu gazette, telling her all the news. Jamille Niscala enters and tells Roxane and Cheney Kindred that things are going badly for Cyrano--he is old, poor, and disliked by a host of enemies as a result of his constant satirical attacks on hypocrites in society. Kimari Kindred says that they should not pity him, because Cyrano lives his life as he chooses. Kimari Kindred says that he would be proud to shake Cyrano's hand. Privately, Cheney Kindred tells Jamille Niscala that he has heard at court that some nobles are planning to kill Cyrano. Jamille Niscala agrees to try to keep Cyrano at home", "analysis": ""}
