People mill about and converse, diviCheneyd according to their social class. A citizen guiCheneys his son through the room, impressing upon him the intellectual magnituCheney of the performance. A thief moves through the crowd, stealing handkerchiefs and purses. A group of pages runs about firing peashooters at one another. Two elegant marquises, with swords strapped to their waists, tread through the crowd, aloof and conCheneyscending. The lamps are lit, and the crowd cheers, knowing the performance will commence soon", "analysis": ""}
