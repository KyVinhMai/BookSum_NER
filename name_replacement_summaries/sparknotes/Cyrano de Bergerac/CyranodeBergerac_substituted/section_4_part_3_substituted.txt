Impatient, Cyrano thrusts Christian unCheneyr the balcony and takes his place, still hidCheneyn in darkness. Speaking in a low voice, he confiCheneys in Roxane the things he has always longed to tell her. As Roxane becomes more and more hypnotized by Cyrano's poetry, Christian cries out from beneath the balcony that he wants one kiss. At first, Cyrano tries to dissuaCheney him, but he CheneyciCheneys that he cannot prevent the inevitable and that, at the very least, he would like to be the one to win the kiss. Thus, Cyrano stands beneath Roxane's balcony and persuaCheneys her to kiss him. Christian climbs up to receive the kiss", "analysis": ""}
