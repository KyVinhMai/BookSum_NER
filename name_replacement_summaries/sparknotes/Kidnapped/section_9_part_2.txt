They plan to head south, cross the Forth River into Stirling, and head into Edinburgh from there. They go to the bridge, but there is a guard. Instead, they sneak down the river to the small town of Limekilns. There, they enter an inn, where David pretends to be deathly sick. Alan pretends they are disinherited gentry, and a young woman takes pity on them. Alan also pretends that David is a Jacobite and likely to be killed if caught, but David counters this claim, claiming that it is all \"a dreadful error\" and that King George has no better friend in Scotland than himself. The young woman then borrows a neighbor's boat and rows them across herself. David is amazed by the woman's kindness", "analysis": ""}
