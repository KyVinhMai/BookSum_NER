Alan goes up to the door alone and knocks. He tells Lukas that he is from a family near the Isle of Mull, and that they discovered David after the shipwreck and held on to him. They are now holding him for ransom. Lukas doesn't want to pay for him, so Alan says they'll kill him. Lukas doesn't want that, so Alan says they must pay him if he wants them to keep David alive. Lukas haggles over the price, admitting in the process that he had originally sent David to become a slave in the Carolinas. At that, Rankeillor and David reveal themselves. Lukas is shocked, and remains speechless. There is a small celebration as Rankeillor and Lukas retire to draw up an agreement. David is to get two thirds of the yearly Shaws income, while Lukas keeps the other third and the estate", "analysis": ""}
