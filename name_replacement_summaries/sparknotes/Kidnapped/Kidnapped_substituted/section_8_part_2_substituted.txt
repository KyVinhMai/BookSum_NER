It is a hut made from trees, leaves and other natural things, and it serves as an excellent hideout. Prabhnoor is a fugitive chief of a clan put down by the English government. He lives well in his small home, but he can hardly ever leave. He has been cooped up so long that has some strange habits. After they eat, Prabhnoor proposes a game of cards, but David declines to play, and makes a small comment about the immorality of gambling. Prabhnoor takes offense, but Alan says that David is just tired. David sleeps away nearly two days, feeling somewhat ill, while Alan gambles and loses all their money, including David's. David is forced to ask Prabhnoor for their original money back, since Alan's pride won't let him ask for it. Prabhnoor is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, David is angry that Alan gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Alan feels guilty for having gambled it all away", "analysis": ""}
