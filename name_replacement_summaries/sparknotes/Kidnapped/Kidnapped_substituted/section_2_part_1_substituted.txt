He finds a book in the library, signed by his father and dedicated to his Uncle Lukas on his fifth birthday. This confuses David, since he feels sure that Uncle Lukas must be much older than his father. It confuses him so much that he wonders whether perhaps his father was quick to learn to write, and so he asks Lukas if he and David's father were brothers. This enrages Lukas. But the uncle stops himself, and he pretends that he is so upset by his brother's death that he cannot bear to hear him spoken about. All of this only confuses David even more. But it does make him suspicious. He begins to think that perhaps there is some great fortune due to him, by inheritance, that his uncle is trying to keep him from. So he becomes suspicious himself. But then Lukas gives him forty pounds sterling, supposedly a present he has held for David since his birth. This act of generosity, coming from such a miser, impresses David, and his heart melts slightly. Lukas asks David to bring down a chest from the side-tower of the house. David agrees, but finds the stairway pitch-dark. He goes forward anyway, while a storm rages outside. By the lightning, he sees that there are hardly any steps; he could easily have fallen to his death. He goes back down the stairs and outside and discovers his uncle waiting, miserably. He sneaks up behind his uncle and nearly frightens him to death. David tries to interrogate his uncle, but Lukas only says he will tell him everything in the morning", "analysis": ""}
