{"name": "Chapter 25", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210309054006/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/kidnapped/section10/", "summary": "In Balquhidder Alan takes the sick and exhausted David to a house in Balquhidder, which is fortunately a house of the Stewart-friendly McLarens. The owner takes David in and puts him in a bed, and the area doctor is called for. Soon the whole surrounding community is aware that they are harboring Alan Breck Stewart and his accomplice. David lies in bed for just over a week, and within a month he is ready to move again. While sick, David is visited by one of the sons of the notorious Aswin Yankarlo, Skyeler Jody. He is aloof, and not very mannered with the McLaren household owner. He speaks to David, thinking he is related to another Balfour, a gentleman, who once helped Jody's brother. David says he is not sure, and Jody turns to leave, rather disgusted that he has actually been talking to a lowbred boy. As he leaves he runs into Alan. The two recognize each other and Alan points out that Aswin Yankarlo attached the Campbell name to his own. After some tough talking, the two men prepare to duel, but the owner of the house intervenes and suggests that they duel by playing the bagpipes instead. The two men play, and when Skyeler plays an air from Alan's country, Alan softens. They then exchanged airs the rest of the night, and become friends", "analysis": ""}
