Now they must decide which direction to go in. Appin, to the west, is crawling with soldiers. The land to the south is crawling with Campbells, and going north will not work for David, who wants to get to Edinburgh, and Alan who needs to get to France. So they decide to head east, though David again realizes that if they parted ways, they might both be safer. They must cross the moors, which are wide and flat, and they run a great risk of being seen, but they have no choice. Half the time they must crawl on their bellies or run on their knees, and soon David becomes very tired. They rest at noon in a bush, and Alan takes first watch. When David takes his watch, he falls asleep, and awakes to discover soldiers coming near them. He wakes Alan, who quickly decides to head for a mountain, Ben Alder, in the northeast. This takes them past the soldiers, forcing them to run on their knees for most of the way. Just as they near the mountain they are ambushed. It turns out to be friends, men of Cluny Macpherson. The men lead them to Cluny's hideaway in the woods", "analysis": ""}
