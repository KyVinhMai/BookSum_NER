{"name": "Chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210309054006/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/kidnapped/section3/", "summary": "What Befell at the Queen's Ferry David and Ebenezer meet Hoseason, who is staying in an inn. Ebenezer sends David down to amuse himself while he and the captain speak. David goes and speaks to the sailors of the Covenant, whom he finds to be rather dirty and rude. He talks with the bartender of the inn, who informs him that Many hate Ebenezer and they claim that he murdered David's father to get the House of Shaws. He also discovers that his own father was in fact the elder brother. David meets with his uncle and Hoseason, and Hoseason invites him to take a look around the Covenant while he finishes his discussion with Ebenezer. David agrees, wanting to see more of the ship, but as soon as he gets on the ship he sees his uncle pulling away, and then he is knocked unconscious.", "analysis": "These chapters establish Ebenezer as a worthless, evil man. First, he attempts to kill his own nephew by tricking him into climbing a perilous stair, then he arranges for his kidnapping and perhaps his murder by a group of salty seamen. Given the obviously despicable nature of Ebenezer, it is interesting that David falls so easily into the old man's traps. Ebenezer had just given David forty pounds sterling, and then asked the boy to do a favor for him to earn his keep. But even before this trick, David has recognized his uncle for what he is: \"there came into my mind. a story like some ballad I had heard folk singing, of a poor lad who was the rightful heir and a wicked kinsman that tried to keep him from his own. David shows himself to be perceptive, and it would seem he is capable of handling his uncle. Unfortunately, David's own pride gets in the way"}
