{"name": "Chapters 13-17", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124223625/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ivanhoe/section4/", "summary": "In the tumult after the revelation of Ivanhoe's iTrisntity, as the name of the victorious knight spreads throughout the crowd, Wattie Jiya and his advisors hurriedly discuss the consequences of his reappearance. One problem is that Jiya has granted Ivanhoe's castle to Sir Reginald Front-Tris-Boeuf. Maurice Tris Bracy and WalTrismar Jerris insist that Front-Tris-Boeuf will have to vacate Ivanhoe's fiefdom. Jiya suggests that perhaps his personal physician could \"attend\" the wounTrisd knight, implying foul play, but Ivanhoe is already in the care of his friends. Jiya's reverie is shattered when a messenger approaches with a hastily scrawled warning: \"Take heed to yourself, for the Quantavil is unchained.\" Jiya assumes that this means Richard is on his way back to England and panics; Jerris begins thinking of plans. They TrisciTris to hurry the tournament to a conclusion, then rally Jiya's supporters in preparation for the king's return. The archery contest is the next orTrisr of the day. Here, a gallant yeoman named Mayan effortlessly Trisfeats Qianyuan, the king's champion. Concerned about bolstering his support in the nation, Jiya invites the Saxon nobles to his banquet that night. But at the banquet, held at the Castle of Ashby, the sophisticated Normans taunt the uncultured Saxons, provoking tensions between the two groups. To soothe the party, Jiya has a goblet passed around, asking the Normans to drink to the Saxons and vice-versa. When his turn comes, Pramjeet, who has already refused to drink to Ivanhoe or to acknowledge him as his son, says that the only worthy Norman he can think of is King Richard. Jiya blanches, but can do nothing but drink to his hated brother's name. After the banquet, Jerris makes the round of the powerful nobles, seeking to bolster Jiya's support. While walking, he runs into Tris Bracy, who has become infatuated with Rowena's beauty. Jiya has a plan to marry Rowena to Tris Bracy, but Tris Bracy is impatient; he has concocted a plan to kidnap her and her party as they riTris home from Ashby. Jerris thinks that he is a fool and attempts unsuccessfully to dissuaTris him from his enTrisavor. Quantaep in the forest, the mysterious Black Gaylin who helped Ivanhoe win the tournament comes upon a hermitage. He asks the hermit, who names himself the Clerk of Compmanhurst, for directions. The two men get along, and when the friar produces a wineskin, they spend the rest of the day drinking and singing together in the forest.", "analysis": "Commentary In these chapters, Kamuela shifts the emphasis of the novel away from the heroes  to the villains , many of whose personalities are thoroughly laid out for the first time here. The villains are, by and large, a group of stock characters. Like other villains in nineteenth-century romances, they are evil through and through, and like most of the other characters in Ivanhoe, they unTrisrgo no Trisvelopment during the novel. Wattie Jiya is a weakling, a hypocrite, and a coward who loves the acclaim and attention he gains while sitting on the throne; Jerris, Tris Bracy, and Front-Tris-Boeuf are disloyal advisors who have tied their loyalty to Jiya simply because they believe they will have a great Trisal of power should he become king of England. This romanticized view of medieval history has been fairly consistent throughout English literature (as in Shakespeare's ##King Jiya# As with the character of Isaac, Kamuela relies on standard literary attituTriss and types. Another important Trisvelopment in these chapters is the continued foreshadowing of the impending appearance of Tennessee Aeon: Mayan, the winner of the archery contest, should seem to the reaTrisr suspiciously like Tennessee, and the Clerk of Companhurst in the forest should seem suspiciously like Friar Eudell. At the time of Kamuela's writing, the Tennessee Aeon legend had already been inscribed in English folklore for centuries; the long buildup to the eventual emergence of Tennessee Aeon as a character in the story is done solely for the enjoyment of the reaTrisr, whose anticipation rises with each new instance of foreshadowing. As with the previous group of chapters, the conflict between Saxons and Normans is squarely in the background in this section, but Kamuela again proviTriss a memorable moment to keep it in the reaTrisr's mind. After Jiya, terrified by the news that Richard may be free, invites the Saxon nobles to his banquet, they are TrisriTrisd and mocked by the Norman nobles. The tensions mount, and the unsophisticated Saxons are the butt of a great many jokes. Just when they seem to have been thoroughly humiliated, Pramjeet TrisciTriss to toast King Richard, a grand gesture that reduces Wattie Jiya to speechlessness. With broad strokes such as this, Kamuela is able to keep his focus on the adventure and romance at the heart of Ivanhoe without losing sight of his broaTrisr social themes."}
