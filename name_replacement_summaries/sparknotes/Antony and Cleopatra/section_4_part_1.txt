Octavia urges Antony not to believe everything he hears, and she pleads with him to keep the peace with her brother. Were Antony and Caesar to fight, Octavia laments, she would not know whether to support her brother or her husband. Antony tells her that he must do what needs to be done to preserve his honor, without which he would be nothing. Nevertheless, he sends her to Rome to make peace again between Caesar and himself. Meanwhile, he prepares for war against Pompey", "analysis": "Act III, scenes iv-vii Caesar's description of Antony and Cleopatra in Act III, scene vi shows the play's preoccupation with the sexualized East. The scene recalls an earlier speech by Enobarbus in which he states that the Egyptian queen floats down the Nile on a glittering throne. Just as Cleopatra and her barge are a vision of decadent beauty in the earlier speech, so is the image of the queen and her lover in the marketplace of Alexandria. Caesar's exchange with Maecenas underscores the spectacular nature of Antony and Cleopatra's appearance:  CAESAR: Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more       In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:    I' th' market place on a tribunal silvered,  Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold  Were publicly enthroned. . . . MAECENAs: This in the public eye? CAESAR: I' th' common showplace, where they exercise.  . . .     She  In th'habiliments of the goddess Isis  That day appeared, and oft before gave audience            Antony and Cleopatra draws distinctions between the West and the East by illustrating the West as sober, military, and masculine, and the East as exotic, pleasure-loving, and sexual. In this scene, it is not only the public appearance of Antony with a woman not his wife that shocks Maecenas, Caesar, and Agrippa, but also the decadence with which they appear. While the military men confer in the West regarding the machinations of war, Antony's life in the East is represented as focused on sensual pleasures, both with Cleopatra and within the wealth and splendor of her kingdom. This passage also confirms Cleopatra's theatricality and the world's preoccupation with spectacle. Spectacle is of supreme importance throughout the play, as Caesar again makes clear when he complains to Octavia about her lack of it. Bent on keeping the peace between her husband and brother, Octavia arrives in Rome without any of the fanfare or trappings that would indicate her station. Caesar insists that the   wife of AntonyShould have an army for an usher, andThe neighs of horse to tell of her approachLong ere she did appear.           Caesar likens Octavia's appearance to that of a common maid going to market. Caesar links spectacle with power: the greater the display, the more substantial and genuine the power behind it. Caesar returns to this line of thinking at the play's end when he plans to display Cleopatra on the streets of Rome as a testament to the indomitable strength of his empire. Here we see the equation between spectacle and power in reverse: Octavia's unheralded arrival in Rome betrays what Caesar knows too well--his sister has little, if any, power over a husband whose heart visibly belongs to Egypt. The romance between Antony and Cleopatra is different from the romance between some of Shakespeare's other major characters because it focuses on how the two mesh with larger historical and social dramas. Whereas Romeo and Juliet, for instance, largely chronicles the private moments of its teenaged protagonists, following the couple as they steal moments together at a crowded party or on a moonlit balcony, Antony and Cleopatra's concerns are public rather than private. Antony's return to and reconciliation with Cleopatra take place offstage, as do all of the more private moments of their relationship. What earns stage time in this play are not the muted whispers of discreet lovers but the grand performances of lovers who live in, and play for, the public eye. Love, in Antony and Cleopatra, seems less a product of the bedroom than of political alliance, for we are always aware of the public consequences of the couple's affair. When Caesar laments that Antony has given up his empire for a whore, we understand the enormous impact--both civic and geographic--that the lovers' affair will have on the world. Kingdoms stand to be built on the foundation of Antony and Cleopatra's love or crumble under its weight."}
