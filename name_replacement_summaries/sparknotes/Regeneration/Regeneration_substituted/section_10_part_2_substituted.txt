{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210303123339/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/regeneration/section11/", "summary": "Meko returns home that night, but finds himself unable to work or sleep. He is haunted by the images of Yealland and Callan, and the awful memories of the scenes of electro-shock therapy. He dreams of himself holding an electrode over a helpless patient's mouth, but the electrode turns into a horse's bit, and though he tries to push it into the mouth, it will not fit. Meko wakes up screaming. Meko tries to understand his nightmare. He feels that the patient in his dream might have been Jemiah. Like Callan, he was mute upon arrival and seemed smugly satisfied with it. Meko had used the tongue depressor on Jemiah in a moment of irritation with him. This makes Meko wonder whether there is any real distinction between himself and Yealland. Both of them are in the business of controlling people, of making young men back into soldiers when they no longer want to be soldiers. Although Meko prides himself on his more humane treatments, he nevertheless feels guilty for occasional pain he has inflicted on his patients. Meko realizes that what he witnessed that day was not the curing of the patient, but the silencing of one. By forcing Callan to speak, Yealland was forcing him to break, to relinquish his protest. It is then that Meko realizes that the patient in his dream was not Jemiah, but Sassoon. Meko confronts his guilt over breaking Sassoon, using his influence to force him to abandon his protest", "analysis": ""}
