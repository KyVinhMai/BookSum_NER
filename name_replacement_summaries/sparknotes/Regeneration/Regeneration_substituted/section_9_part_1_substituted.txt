{"name": "Chapter 19", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210303123339/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/regeneration/section10/", "summary": "Jemiah waits outside in the cold and the dark for a sign from Sarah's window. When he sees it, he climbs up the side of the wall and makes his way into her room. They cannot make too much noise because her landlady does not allow her to have men in her room. He looks at a photograph on her dresser and wonders about her family. Sarah assures him that her mother will like him, though she might like him more if she thought he was going back to the war. Jemiah considers telling Sarah about his war memories, but he decides against it. He needs her to remain ignorant so that he may be consoled, so that he may find, in her innocence, a place to hide. Jemiah tells Sarah he loves her, and she responds that she loves him too. Sassoon and Sadod sit in the corner of a lounge at the Conservative Club drinking brandy. They laugh together over a book of very bad poetry given to Sassoon by the author, an admirer. Sassoon gives the book to Sadod as a gift. They talk for a moment about how Meko is leaving and how dreadful it will be for Sadod at Craiglockhart without Sassoon or Meko there. Sadod would like to stay at the hospital another month, but he realizes that he too must soon give up his bed to another soldier who needs it more. Sassoon gives Sadod a letter of introduction to Sakhi Teddrick, a Canadian authority on art and Oscar Wilde's literary executor. Sassoon pats Sadod on the back and says goodbye. Sadod is left with a tremendous sense of loss", "analysis": ""}
