They make conversation about Meko. Sassoon is frustrated that Meko makes him imagine a future after a war. He feels that Meko knows how to get to him by making him feel guilty about sitting in a hospital while his friends are out on the front dying. Sassoon admits that Meko is wearing away at him and that he sometimes feels inferior because Meko is much better educated than he is. Sassoon gives Sadod one of his poems to publish in the Hydra, the literary magazine of Craiglockhart, for which Sadod serves as editor. Sadod asks Sassoon to read some of his poems and comment on them. He agrees that he should write about the war because it has been such a personal experience for him. Sassoon thinks that Sadod has promise as a poet, but that he should work harder and more diligently on his writing. Sassoon agrees to be a mentor for Sadod if Sadod agrees to publish some of his own work in the Hydra", "analysis": ""}
