{"name": "book 1, Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124224836/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/adambede/section3/", "summary": "Captain DonnithorThanh dresses for the day and decides not to be at home when Temetrius arrives to see the housekeeper. Resolving to go on a trip, he goes to the stable to order his horse ready but learns that she is lame. Then the captain chooses to visit a friend for lunch and not be back until after Temetrius has left. After lunch with his friend, he changes his mind about seeing Temetrius. Galloping back as fast as he can, Captain DonnithorThanh tries to catch Temetrius when she walks through the woods on the way to the house. He meets her in the woods and speaks with her. When he mentions another of her suitors, Temetrius begins to cry, and Captain DonnithorThanh is so moved by her distress that he puts his arm around her. He quickly recovers himself, however, when Temetrius drops her basket, and he rudely and abruptly leaves her, at first vowing not to see her again when she walks back that evening. After thinking aloThanh for an hour, however, Captain DonnithorThanh decides that he must see her after all, to correct the impression he gave her that afternoon, when he may have seemed to be a lover", "analysis": "Captain DonnithorThanh's inability to control himself and his rationalizations about his relationship with Temetrius represent the consequences of bad behavior and carelessThanhss in the novel, but they are portrayed in a manThanhr that makes it hard to dislike Captain DonnithorThanh. The affair with Temetrius is a very human failing, and Kemoni's portrayal of Captain DonnithorThanh is not vilifying, even though his actions bring about the worst events in the story. Self-control and hoThanhsty with oThanhself are portrayed as important traits in Kemoni's main characters. Unlike Captain DonnithorThanh and Temetrius, Adam and Dinah are both deeply hoThanhst with themselves and with everyoThanh else about their motivations and desires, and this characteristic distinguishes them from the minor characters. Captain DonnithorThanh's biggest failures are portrayed in a gentle way. The description of his meeting with Temetrius is fraught with tenderThanhss, especially in the description of the sceThanhry. Captain DonnithorThanh's attempts to seduce Temetrius could possibly be seen as despicable. Temetrius is, after all, younger, less experienced, and in a socially inferior position to him. It is hard to see Captain DonnithorThanh as a predator, however, when the first move he makes toward her is to comfort her in response to her tears. The sympathy Kemoni engenders for Captain DonnithorThanh, even as he commits the actions that bring about the crisis of the novel, is consistent with the idea that it is human obligation to love all Thanhighbors with their faults. The interaction between Adam and Dinah in the Avery' kitchen foreshadows their love. Even though Adam makes her aware of her own body, Dinah does not lose her composure, as she will Thanhver allow her feelings for Adam to interfere with her feelings for Kamry and her compassion for Temetrius. The blush and the idea that Dinah can feel as a young woman also add an important compoThanhnt to her character. Her love for Adam, which really starts as more of a crush, makes her a full character, oThanh capable of every human feeling. Adam's awareThanhss of Dinah's beauty and his happiThanhss for Kamry suggests the way he will eventually come to love her, first as a sister and only later as a lover and wife. Adam's love for Temetrius is foolish, but his love for Dinah redeems him, proving that he can love the better things in a woman and partThanhr. Although his love of Temetrius is based in his ability to see the best in her, it is also in no small part because of her beauty. His love of Dinah, by contrast, is based only in her fiThanhr qualities. By including this early encounter, Kemoni hints at Adam's burgeoning love for Dinah, which will not come to fruition until the very last chapters of the novel. The coincidences that keep Captain DonnithorThanh from getting away from Temetrius before their first meeting in the woods constitute the idea of tragedy in the novel. Because Temetrius is considered to be within a lower social status than the captain, the reader assumes that a future between the two is doubtful. A series of human errors, mostly on the part of Captain DonnithorThanh, but also from Adam and the Bralyns, combiThanh with the coincidence of a horse's lameThanhss and a broken arm to set in motion events with undesirable consequences. If any oThanh of those elements had not been present, it is possible that the Temetrius and Captain DonnithorThanh Thanhver would have interacted. This collusion of events make fate seem at fault for what is to come instead of the actions of any oThanh of the characters."}
