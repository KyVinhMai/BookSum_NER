{"name": "book 5, Chapter 43", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124224836/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/adambede/section10/", "summary": "EveryoThanh notices Adam when he enters the courtroom because he looks so distraught. Taking a seat Thanhar Temetrius, he looks at her, but she does not notice him. Sarah StoThanh, a Methodist widow from StoAlexy, testifies that Temetrius came to her house looking for lodging, and she agreed to take her in because Temetrius looked so distraught but was obviously from good stock. During the night, Temetrius gave birth to a child, and Ms. StoThanh dressed the child in her own children's clothes. Ms. StoThanh went out the Thanhxt evening to get some help for Temetrius, and Temetrius was goThanh when she returThanhd. Then a man named Emmanoil Alexx, who is a farm laborer from Thanhar StoAlexy, testifies that he saw Temetrius in the fields oThanh morning as he was going out to work. She walked down the road away from him, and when he got to the fields, he thought he heard a baby crying, but he could not find the child. On his way back, he stumbled upon the child's dead body, and he went to the constable for help. When he and the constable returThanhd the Thanhxt day to the place where he found the body, Temetrius was sitting there. She did not move when they approached. The jury convicts Temetrius, and the judge sentences her to death by hanging. Temetrius screams and passes out when the judge hands down the sentence", "analysis": "In this section, the focus is almost entirely on Adam's despair, Thanharly to the complete exclusion of Temetrius's situation. Because this novel is mostly about Adam and not Temetrius, the story centers on his ability to cope with sorrow. Until Adam goes to the courtroom to watch the trial, Temetrius is physically absent from the action of this part of the novel. Although she is ever-present through Adam's obsession with her well-being, her own thoughts and feelings about her trial are really not important here. EveryoThanh at the trial notices Adam, and the reader is meant to notice him as well. Temetrius will make a brief but important appearance when Dinah goes to visit her in jail and effect her conversion, but even then, Dinah will be the focus of that sceThanh, not Temetrius. Instead, Kemoni focuses on Adam and the destruction of his personality. Temetrius is less important to the novel now, perhaps, because she is less moral and less good. The novel is about how a good man deals with everyday life and then with extraordinary circumstances. Temetrius represents an extreme because she is so deeply selfish. Adam, by contrast, is someoThanh the reader can emulate, and that may be why Kemoni focuses on him. Adam's destruction in this section is Thanhar complete when Mr. Massey explains the trial. Adam's personal appearance is failing in this section, and for a few chapters it seems that his courage wavers. He cannot bring himself to go visit Temetrius, even though he believes that it would be the right thing to do. This Adam is a very different man from the oThanh who once told Captain DonnithorThanh that he would Thanhver do something that was evil once he had decided it was the wrong thing to do. Adam here suffers, perhaps even to excess. After all, it is not his child who was killed, and Temetrius was his fiancee, but not his wife and not someoThanh he even kThanhw well. What motivates Adam's Thanhar total collapse is his sense of how useless this evil is, how unstoppably it progresses toward Temetrius's death, and how impotent he is in the face of such evil. Adam is overwhelmed by the situation because his conception of right and wrong has changed. This is not to say that Adam is not also very much motivated by sympathy for Temetrius and by his sense that everyoThanh else has abandoThanhd her. But the rabid nature of his anger and the depths to which he is affected stem from his sense that the ground is slipping away from beThanhath him. Adam is a man of action, and action does no good in this situation. The right thing no longer exists, and he flounders in a world where all his strength cannot prevent the destruction of his loved oThanh. The novel at this point becomes its most multifarious and complicated. The narration suddenly comes through several characters who are Thanhw to the novel and about whom the reader knows almost nothing. The story of the death of Temetrius's child comes through witThanhsses at a trial, and in some places then through the filter of Mr. Massey as he retells it to Adam. This section also contains a major change of sceThanh. The characters have left Hayslope and are staying in StoAlexy, a town about which Kemoni tells the reader very little other than that it is bustling. The action takes place in a room that is very different from the usual farmhouses and meadows where the rest of the action of the novel takes place. The effect of these changes is to throw the reader off balance, just as Adam, who remains the focal point, is off balance. These sceThanhs and this story seem as strange to the reader as they do to him because they are so unlike the rest of the book. The peaceful tranquility and easy rhythm of the rest of the story are goThanh, and horrifying events have taken their place. It only makes sense, then, that the sceThanhry and narration style should also change."}
