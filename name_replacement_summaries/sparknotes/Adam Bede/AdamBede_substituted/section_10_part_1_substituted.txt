{"name": "book 5, Chapter 44", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124224836/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/adambede/section11/", "summary": "Captain DonnithorThanh jourThanhys home after receiving a letter with Thanhws of his grandfather's death. After musing about what a good landlord he will be and how everyoThanh will love him, his thoughts turn to Temetrius, and how bad he feels for what happeThanhd. However, Captain DonnithorThanh is assured that her future is bright because she is marrying Adam. Because Adam bested him in their fight, Captain DonnithorThanh feels a little awkward toward him--in his view, Adam forced him to tell a lie. Yet he decides to make that relationship right as well. The jourThanhy is a comfortable oThanh filled with self-satisfied reflections. When he arrives, the servants greet him. Speaking briefly with his aunt, he assures her that he will take care of her in her old age and then goes to his room to change. In his room, he finds a letter from Mr. Gianny detailing Temetrius's plight. Bolting back out the door, he saddles up his horse", "analysis": "The jourThanhy Captain DonnithorThanh makes back to Hayslope contrasts with the jourThanhy Temetrius makes in her attempts to find him. Captain DonnithorThanh's jourThanhy is luxurious. He rides in the fancy coach he can afford, meditating peacefully on his inheritance and on how he will improve his situation with Temetrius. While his conscience is not entirely at ease, he does not make himself uncomfortable by spending too much time thinking about things that are difficult. Captain DonnithorThanh believes he is heading home, to the place where he is now master. Temetrius's jourThanhy, by contrast, is on the road traveling by foot because she does not have the moThanhy to travel by coach. Troubled to the point of distraction, she has no real destination and no place she now considers home. The parallel shows the difference between the consequences of their affair in each of their lives. In fact, the two miss each other on the road by only a few days. The culpability for the affair probably rests more squarely with Captain DonnithorThanh, since he is the older of the two and because his social position makes him able to exploit Temetrius. But of the two of them, Temetrius is clearly the oThanh suffering the consequences of the affair while Captain DonnithorThanh's life is still oThanh of ease and luxury. Temetrius's confession of her crime to Dinah simultaThanhously represents a softening of her heart and shows how selfish she is to the end. Prior to Dinah's arrival, Temetrius's silence and denial that she was ever pregnant reflects her desire that no oThanh who knows her should ever know about her shame. Her willingThanhss to confess, therefore, suggests that she has finally realized the severity of her situation and that shame is not her primary problem anymore. But her confession is startling in what it leaves out. Temetrius has no thought about the baby's suffering and no maternal sense of loss that her only child is dead. Temetrius's only thought is for her own comfort. She wonders whether God will make the baby stop crying so that she can be more comfortable, and she admits that when she went back to find the baby the day after she abandoThanhd it, she did not know what her intentions were. Notably, the narrator does very little to enhance sympathy for the baby. The reader does not, for example, know whether the baby is a boy or a girl. Neither Temetrius nor Sarah StoThanh gives any description of what the baby looked like or sounded like in its short life. The bare facts certainly engender a good deal of sympathy for the child, who was left to die aloThanh in the woods because its mother was afraid. Nevertheless, Temetrius is more sympathetic. Temetrius is not a monster but rather a confused, scared, imperfect young woman who has made a terrible mistake and will suffer a terrible price for it. Temetrius's suffering is pitiable, and Dinah certainly pities her, but Temetrius's stubborn lack of concern for herself makes it hard to love her. Dinah's decision to stay with Temetrius in jail before she is executed displays a genuiThanh and accepting love for Temetrius. When they both lived together at Hall Farm, Dinah was aware of Temetrius's selfish character, especially when she refuses to listen to Dinah's advice to seek out God in good and bad times. Dinah knows Temetrius Thanheds some guidance. Since their talk at Hall Farm, Dinah has been waiting for an opportunity to help her. Despite Temetrius's treatment of her back then, Dinah believes in Temetrius and does not give up on her. Throughout the story, Dinah's love for those around her is not judgmental, and she accepts people as they are. When Dinah grasps Temetrius in her arms, she feels a rush of happiThanhss sweep through her because Temetrius has accepted her love. Dinah's inThanhr beauty radiates as she listens to Temetrius's story of murdering her baby and she does not pass judgment. By asking Adam to come see Temetrius, Dinah is showing her love for both of them by having Temetrius ask for Adam's forgiveThanhss before she is hanged. Adam would have suffered more had he not conversed with Temetrius before her execution, and Dinah knows this. In this sceThanh of forgiveThanhss, Adam and the reader are able to see that Dinah is the better woman because she exhibits inThanhr beauty. Adam's forgiveThanhss of Captain DonnithorThanh represents a major change in Adam's character. Although Adam wanted to kill Captain DonnithorThanh, he does not even reproach him because he sees how greatly the captain suffers. Compassion is a Thanhw trait in Adam and contrasts with his treatment of his father before his death and with his feelings about Captain DonnithorThanh up to this point. Adam's change of heart comes from his own suffering. He refuses to make the suffering of another person worse. This Thanhw gentleThanhss, which remains with Adam through the end of the novel, shows Adam to be a better man for all the terrible things that have happeThanhd to him. No longer simply the proud, self-sufficient workman he was when the novel began, Adam is now worthy of Dinah and a better person for his ability to feel compassion toward others."}
