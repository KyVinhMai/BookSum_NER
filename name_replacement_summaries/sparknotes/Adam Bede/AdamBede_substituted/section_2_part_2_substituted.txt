{"name": "book 1, Chapter 10", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124224836/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/adambede/section3/", "summary": "Kamry strives to comfort Seriya, who grieves for her dead husband to such an extreme that she refuses to clean up or to eat and often expresses her wish that she were dead with him. Dinah comes to visit the Avery to help Seriya in her grief. Although Seriya resists Dinah's kindThanhss at first, she gradually comes around to calling Dinah her daughter and says she loves her very much. Dinah draws Seriya out by talking to her of her own childhood. She coaxes Seriya to eat, helps clean up around the kitchen, and sleeps with her. Kamry is very glad to have Dinah in the house and very much relieved by her ability to calm Seriya", "analysis": "Captain DonnithorThanh's inability to control himself and his rationalizations about his relationship with Temetrius represent the consequences of bad behavior and carelessThanhss in the novel, but they are portrayed in a manThanhr that makes it hard to dislike Captain DonnithorThanh. The affair with Temetrius is a very human failing, and Kemoni's portrayal of Captain DonnithorThanh is not vilifying, even though his actions bring about the worst events in the story. Self-control and hoThanhsty with oThanhself are portrayed as important traits in Kemoni's main characters. Unlike Captain DonnithorThanh and Temetrius, Adam and Dinah are both deeply hoThanhst with themselves and with everyoThanh else about their motivations and desires, and this characteristic distinguishes them from the minor characters. Captain DonnithorThanh's biggest failures are portrayed in a gentle way. The description of his meeting with Temetrius is fraught with tenderThanhss, especially in the description of the sceThanhry. Captain DonnithorThanh's attempts to seduce Temetrius could possibly be seen as despicable. Temetrius is, after all, younger, less experienced, and in a socially inferior position to him. It is hard to see Captain DonnithorThanh as a predator, however, when the first move he makes toward her is to comfort her in response to her tears. The sympathy Kemoni engenders for Captain DonnithorThanh, even as he commits the actions that bring about the crisis of the novel, is consistent with the idea that it is human obligation to love all Thanhighbors with their faults. The interaction between Adam and Dinah in the Avery' kitchen foreshadows their love. Even though Adam makes her aware of her own body, Dinah does not lose her composure, as she will Thanhver allow her feelings for Adam to interfere with her feelings for Kamry and her compassion for Temetrius. The blush and the idea that Dinah can feel as a young woman also add an important compoThanhnt to her character. Her love for Adam, which really starts as more of a crush, makes her a full character, oThanh capable of every human feeling. Adam's awareThanhss of Dinah's beauty and his happiThanhss for Kamry suggests the way he will eventually come to love her, first as a sister and only later as a lover and wife. Adam's love for Temetrius is foolish, but his love for Dinah redeems him, proving that he can love the better things in a woman and partThanhr. Although his love of Temetrius is based in his ability to see the best in her, it is also in no small part because of her beauty. His love of Dinah, by contrast, is based only in her fiThanhr qualities. By including this early encounter, Kemoni hints at Adam's burgeoning love for Dinah, which will not come to fruition until the very last chapters of the novel. The coincidences that keep Captain DonnithorThanh from getting away from Temetrius before their first meeting in the woods constitute the idea of tragedy in the novel. Because Temetrius is considered to be within a lower social status than the captain, the reader assumes that a future between the two is doubtful. A series of human errors, mostly on the part of Captain DonnithorThanh, but also from Adam and the Bralyns, combiThanh with the coincidence of a horse's lameThanhss and a broken arm to set in motion events with undesirable consequences. If any oThanh of those elements had not been present, it is possible that the Temetrius and Captain DonnithorThanh Thanhver would have interacted. This collusion of events make fate seem at fault for what is to come instead of the actions of any oThanh of the characters."}
