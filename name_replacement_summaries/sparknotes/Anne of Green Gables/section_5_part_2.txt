Marilla explains that Mrs. Allan has invited all the children in her Sunday school class, but this news does not diminish Anne's excitement. As usual, Marilla is troubled by Anne's enthusiasm, believing it will cause Anne pain when reality does not live up to her expectations. Anne is nervous that she will forget her manners and offend Mrs. Allan. Marilla gives her etiquette advice and tells her not to think about how she should behave but to imagine what sorts of behavior would please Mrs. Allan. After tea, Anne describes her time at Mrs. Allan's home. She admires Mrs. Allan so much that she says she wants to become a minister's wife. She tells Marilla that, according to Mrs. Rachel, the school is getting a new teacher named Miss Muriel Stacy", "analysis": ""}
