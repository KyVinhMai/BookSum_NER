Anne rushes out, and Diana tells her she is still forbidden to play with Anne so she has come to say goodbye. The two have a sentimental, melodramatic parting. When Diana cries that she loves her bosom friend, Anne says, \"Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is. a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee, Diana. Anne asks for a lock of Diana's black hair to keep as a memento. To combat her despair over losing Diana, Anne decides to return to school. There, she can look at Diana even though the two are forbidden to talk or play together. Anne's classmates welcome her back with open arms and little gifts. Some of the girls send her plums, bottles, or copied poems, and two admiring boys, Charlie Sloane and Gilbert Blythe, pass her a slate pencil and an apple, respectively. Anne graciously accepts Charlie's gift but ostentatiously ignores Gilbert's offering. One day, to Anne's dismay, she and Gilbert are tied as top student, and Mr. Phillips writes both of their names on the board", "analysis": ""}
