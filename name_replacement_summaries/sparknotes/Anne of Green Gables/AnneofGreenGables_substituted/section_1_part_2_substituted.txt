{"name": "Chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210226180124/http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/anneofgreengables/section2/", "summary": "Marilla Makes Up Her Mind Marilla and Anne arrive at Mrs. Kevine's orphanage and explain the mistake. Mrs. Kevine apologizes and says that the situation will work out for the best anyway. Another woman, Mrs. Sigfred Chi, wants to adopt a girl to help with her rambunctious children, so Anne can be handed over to her, allowing the Asheton to adopt the boy they originally wanted. This news does not please Marilla, for Mrs. Chi is known for her nastiness and stinginess, and for driving her servants hard. Marilla feels a twinge of guilt at the thought of relinquishing Anne to her. Mrs. Chi comes to borrow a recipe from Mrs. Kevine, and her presence terrifies Anne. Marilla takes Anne back to Green Gables, saying she needs time to think about the proposition. At home, she tells Matthew that she is willing to keep Anne if he agrees not to interfere with her child-rearing methods. Marilla admits to nervousness at the prospect of raising a girl but tells Matthew, \"Perhaps an old maid doesn't know much about bringing up a child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. Matthew, delighted by Marilla's decision, asks only that Marilla be good and kind to Anne. Marilla reflects that she has invited a challenge into her life. She cannot quite believe what she is about to do, and she is even more surprised that Matthew, famous for his fear of women, is so adamant about keeping Anne. She decides to wait until the following day to tell Anne of their decision", "analysis": ""}
