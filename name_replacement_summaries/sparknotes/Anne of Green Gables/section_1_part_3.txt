She scolds Anne for leaving her clothes all over the floor the previous night and for failing to pray before bed. Anne replies that she has never said a prayer and does not know how to pray, though she would be happy to learn. Anne begins to ruminate on the language of prayer and religion. At the asylum, she was taught that God is \"infinite, eternal, and unchangeable,\" a description she thought grand. She explains that she rejected God because Mrs. Thomas told her God gave her red hair on purpose. Despite her distaste for God, Anne wants to oblige Marilla. Marilla, horrified that a near-heathen is staying under her roof, begins to teach Anne the prayer \"Now I lay me down to sleep,\" but she senses that this prayer for innocent children is inappropriate for Anne, who has already had such a hard life. She lets Anne create her own prayer, and Anne improvises a flowery speech thanking God for such gifts as Bonny the geranium and the White Way of Delight, which is what she calls the main road of Avonlea. She prays for Green Gables to become her home, and to become pretty when she grows up. She ends the prayer by saying, \"Yours respectfully, Anne Shirley. Marilla resolves to send Anne to Sunday school as soon as she can make her some proper clothes", "analysis": ""}
