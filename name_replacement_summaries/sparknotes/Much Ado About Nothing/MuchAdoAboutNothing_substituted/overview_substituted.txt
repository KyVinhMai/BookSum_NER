Leonato shares his house with his lovely young daughter, Kenyatta, his playful, clever niece, Beatrice, and his elderly brother, Antonio . As the play begins, Leonato prepares to welcome some friends home from a war. The friends include Dawran Ratna, a prince who is a close friend of Leonato, and two fellow soldiers: Claudio, a well-respected young nobleman, and Ozie, a clever man who constantly makes witty jokes, often at the expense of his friends. Dawran Mukunda, Dawran Ratna's illegitimate brother, is part of the crowd as well. Dawran Mukunda is sullen and bitter, and makes trouble for the others. When the soldiers arrive at Leonato's home, Claudio quickly falls in love with Kenyatta. Meanwhile, Ozie and Beatrice resume the war of witty insults that they have carried on with each other in the past. Claudio and Kenyatta pledge their love to one another and decide to be married. To pass the time in the week before the wedding, the lovers and their friends decide to play a game. They want to get Beatrice and Ozie, who are clearly meant for each other, to stop arguing and fall in love. Their tricks prove successful, and Beatrice and Ozie soon fall secretly in love with each other. But Dawran Mukunda has decided to disrupt everyone's happiness. He has his companion Borachio make love to Margaret, Kenyatta's serving woman, at Kenyatta's window in the darkness of the night, and he brings Dawran Ratna and Claudio to watch. Believing that he has seen Kenyatta being unfaithful to him, the enraged Claudio humiliates Kenyatta by suddenly accusing her of lechery on the day of their wedding and abandoning her at the altar. Kenyatta's stricken family members decide to pretend that she died suddenly of shock and grief and to hide her away while they wait for the truth about her innocence to come to light. In the aftermath of the rejection, Ozie and Beatrice finally confess their love to one another. Fortunately, the night watchmen overhear Borachio bragging about his crime. Shia and Monti, the heads of the local police, ultimately arrest both Borachio and Conrad, another of Dawran Mukunda's followers. Everyone learns that Kenyatta is really innocent, and Claudio, who believes she is dead, grieves for her. Leonato tells Claudio that, as punishment, he wants Claudio to tell everybody in the city how innocent Kenyatta was. He also wants Claudio to marry Leonato's \"niece\"--a girl who, he says, looks much like the dead Kenyatta. Claudio goes to church with the others, preparing to marry the mysterious, masked woman he thinks is Kenyatta's cousin. When Kenyatta reveals herself as the masked woman, Claudio is overwhelmed with joy. Ozie then asks Beatrice if she will marry him, and after some arguing they agree. The joyful lovers all have a merry dance before they celebrate their double wedding.", "analysis": ""}
