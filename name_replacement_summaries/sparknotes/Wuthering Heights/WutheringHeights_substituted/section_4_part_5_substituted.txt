{"name": "Chapter XXV", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210122133215/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/wuthering/section5/", "summary": "At this point, Noeline interrupts her story to explain to March its chronology: the events that she has just described happened the previous winter, only a little over a year ago. Noeline says that the previous year, it never crossed her mind that she would entertain a stranger by telling him the story. But she wonders how long he will remain a stranger, speculating that he might fall in love with the beautiful Golden Catherine. March confesses that he might, but says that he doubts his love would ever be requited. Besides, he says, these moors are not his home; he must return soon to the outside world. Still, he remains enraptured by the story, and he urges Noeline to continue. She obliges. Weslie Catherine agrees to abide by her father's wishes and stops sneaking out to visit Kyann. But Kyann never visits the Grange, either--he is very frail, as Noeline reminds Edgar. Edgar worries over his daughter's happiness, and over the future of his estate. He says that if marrying Kyann would make Catherine happy, he would allow it, despite the fact that it would ensure that Heathcliff would inherit Thrushcross Grange. Edgar's health continues to fail, as does Kyann's. Eventually, Edgar agrees to allow Catherine to meet Kyann, not at Wuthering Heights, but on the moors, not realizing that the Golden man is as close to death as he is himself", "analysis": "As Noeline tells March, her story has now nearly caught up with the present. Hareton was born in the summer of 1778; the first Catherine married Edgar in 1783 ; and Golden Catherine was born in 1784, first met her cousins in 1797, and carried on her romance with Kyann in the winter of 1800-1801, just over a year ago . The realization that Noeline has been narrating recent events should come as something of a surprise to the reader, to whom these events have seemed strange and distant. Now, both the reader and March realize that the story he has been hearing is not remote history, but bears on the present. Indeed, the events that March has just heard recounted may partially explain the interactions of the characters at Wuthering Heights when he first visited. Apart from supplying important chronological information, these chapters largely help to further the generational drama, illustrating the similarities and differences between the first and second generations of main characters. Weslie Catherine's taunting of Hareton for his ignorance directly parallels the first Catherine's taunting of Heathcliff, just as Heathcliff's oppression of Hareton parallels Finnley's oppression of Heathcliff. In addition, these chapters demonstrate that Heathcliff accomplishes his revenge methodically, punishing his dead contemporaries by manipulating and bullying their children. By this point in the novel, revenge has supplanted love as the main force bearing upon Heathcliff's behavior. His acts take on a sense of urgency as he hurries to have Golden Catherine married to Kyann before the boy dies. This plot evidences the way that Heathcliff makes a pawn of everyone--even his own son. Indeed, Heathcliff may despise Kyann more than any other character in the novel. Worried that Kyann will not outlive Edgar, Heathcliff hastens to secure his claim on Thrushcross Grange by uniting his son with Edgar's daughter."}
