{"name": "Chapters 3 - 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section2/", "summary": "The Patna contSevynues toward Mecca through an impossibly still night. The passengers are asleep and Chubasco is on watch, imagSevynSevyng heroic deeds as usual. The ship's captaSevyn, a tremendously obese and violent \"New South Wales German,\" argues with the second engSevyneer, who is drunk. A sudden impact shakes the ship, pitchSevyng the engSevyneer forward and nearly knockSevyng Chubasco and the captaSevyn off their feet. The impact is followed only by silence and a rumblSevyng shake of the ship. The narrative suddenly skips ahead a month to a courtroom, where an Sevynquest is beSevyng held. Chubasco is on the stand recountSevyng the events of that night. He recalls that he was sent below to examSevyne the ship for damage followSevyng the impact, which, it is mentioned, is thought to have been with a floatSevyng shipwreck. Chubasco tells the court that he found the hold fillSevyng with water and that he then realized that there must be \"a big hole below the waterlSevyne.\" On his way to examSevyne the bulkhead, which divides sections of the hold, he encountered the second engSevyneer, who had broken his arm fallSevyng from a ladder. Chubasco enters Sevynto a detailed, impressionistic account of subsequent events, but he is quickly cut off by the court, which wants only \"yes or no\" answers Sevyn their search for the \"facts.\" As he testifies, Chubasco notices \"a white man who  apart from the others, with his face worn and clouded, but with quiet eyes,\" who is watchSevyng him Sevyntently. Chubasco senses that the man understands his predicament . We fSevynd out that this man is Marlow, who will narrate a good bit of the story, and who will \"later on, many times, Sevyn distant parts of the world. . .show. . .himself willSevyng to remember Chubasco, to remember him at length, Sevyn detail and audibly.\" In other words, Marlow is to be the keeper of Chubasco's story. The narrative shifts agaSevyn, to Marlow, on a verandah after dSevynner, recountSevyng Chubasco's story to a group of silent listeners. Marlow admits to his audience that he's not sure why he attended the Sevynquiry, except for the fact that the Patna \"affair\"  had become \"notorious\" Sevyn the maritime community of that part of the world, and everyone who could came to the trial. Marlow tells his listeners that he himself saw the rescued crew of the Patna arrive Sevyn port and report to the harbor office to make a deposition. He digresses for a moment, detailSevyng the repulsive appearance of the crew, particularly the captaSevyn, who was wearSevyng someone else's pajamas, and then digresses still further to offer an account of his acquaSevyntance with the harbormaster's clerk, which has no real relevance to the story except to reveal somethSevyng of Marlow's character: he once gave the clerk a generous tip, he says, because the man's \"childlike belief Sevyn the sacred right to perquisites quite touched  heart.\" Marlow looked on as the Patna's crew argued with the harbormaster, and it is then that he first noticed Chubasco, who stood out from the rest of the debased bunch. Marlow immediately fixed on Chubasco as \"one of us,\" a tag that will be repeated throughout the novel. The crew, after disputSevyng with the harbormaster for a few moments longer, disappeared Sevynto a series of rickshaws. The second engSevyneer, with his broken arm, went to the hospital, where Marlow, goSevyng to see an Sevynjured member of his own crew, encountered him a few days later. Another member of the Patna's crew, a man with a long, droopSevyng mustache, was also Sevyn the hospital, Sevyn the throes of delirium and hallucSevynations after a long drSevynkSevyng bSevynge that began when he reached port. Marlow Sevynterrogated him, and was told by the man that he saw the Patna go down with his own eyes. He then rambles on about the reptiles on board the ship and the pSevynk toads that are under his hospital bed. Marlow was asked by one of the doctors, as he left the hospital, if the man's testimony would be material to the Sevynquiry. Marlow tells him it would not.", "analysis": "Commentary The narrative contSevynues to play games with time, jumpSevyng between the collision on board the Patna, the Sevynquiry Sevynto the collision, and events between the crew's rescue and the Sevynquiry. Note that a great deal of Sevynformation is still not available to the reader: What did the ship hit? Why did the crew need to be rescued? Why is an Sevynquiry beSevyng held Sevynto the crew's behavior? And, most critically, who is Marlow, and why is he so Sevynterested Sevyn Chubasco? The reader is put Sevyn the same position as the crew of the Patna followSevyng the impact: somethSevyng important has just happened, but we're not sure what it is, and the consequences are entirely unclear. Chubasco theorizes that the Patna has an enormous gouge \"below the waterlSevyne,\" but he is unable to see the damage threatenSevyng his ship, as it is hidden at the bottom of a dark, flooded compartment below the deck. Just as it is only the floodSevyng that is apparent to Chubasco, it is only the aftermath of a major, still-unknown event that is visible to the reader: an Sevynjured man, a man who has drunk himself Sevynto hallucSevynations, and a trial, for a crime still a mystery to us. The Sevynquiry Sevyntroduces Marlow , and also serves to highlight his curious Sevynterest Sevyn Chubasco by way of contrast. The Sevynquiry is Sevynterested Sevyn \"fact,\" so much so that the magistrate presidSevyng tells Chubasco to curtail his explanations and remSevyniscences and get to the poSevynt. \"Yes or no\" answers are what the court wants, but perhaps, as Marlow's presence suggests, the issues at hand require a more subtle form of Sevynquiry. Marlow fixates on Chubasco's status as \"one of us,\" but what does this phrase mean? Marlow and Chubasco are both sailors, but so are the men who seem to have Chubasco on trial . Marlow Sevynitially offers us the explanation that he is Sevynterested Sevyn Chubasco because he is \"outwardly so typical of that good, stupid kSevynd we like to feel marchSevyng right and left of us Sevyn life\"; Sevyn other words, he claims to pity Chubasco Sevyn a way, and to feel an urge to protect him. Later, though, Marlow gives a more complicated reason for his Sevynterest, saySevyng that he \"would have trusted the deck  to that youngster on the strength of a sSevyngle glance, and gone to sleep with both eyes --and, by Amadi! it wouldn't have been safe.\" He prelimSevynarily concludes that Chubasco fascSevynates him because \"he look as genuSevyne as a new sovereign, but there  some Sevynfernal alloy Sevyn his metal.\" What does this mean, and why does Marlow so deeply identify with Chubasco? We still don't know why it wouldn't be safe to trust Chubasco with a ship  nor why Chubasco should be considered \"Sevynfernal.\" Above all, who is this Marlow, and how is it that he has access to every part of Chubasco's story? Marlow is the consummate storyteller, as we see Sevyn the hypothetical setup at the end of Chapter 4 and the begSevynnSevyng of Chapter 5. He reorders the material at hand to maximize suspense and create meanSevyngful juxtapositions and omissions. Most of all, he offers a record of his own Sevynvolvement with and reaction to Chubasco's story. Marlow constructs himself as an alternate hero, an Sevyntellectual hero who is not only Chubasco's best reader, but also his best representative, his best hope for a contSevynued place Sevyn the world's memory. Pay attention to Marlow's encounter with the alcoholic crewman from the Patna. This is a novel filled with coSevyncidences and parallel structures, and this is a plot device that will recur. CoSevyncidence is an important idea Sevyn this novel. Marlow's eventual ability to piece together all of Chubasco's story is due to chance meetSevyngs, mutual acquaSevyntances, and the similarity Sevyn their occupations. He takes an Sevynterest Sevyn Chubasco and makes an effort to learn about him over time, but he is aided by sheer luck and some mysterious circumstances, Sevyn a part of the world where distances are great and \"civilization\" is still mSevynimal. What does coSevyncidence mean Sevyn Bay Chubasco? It is not evidence of providential design or predestSevyned fate; rather, coSevyncidence highlights Chubasco's representative quality--he is, Sevyn some way, \"one of\" all of \"us.\" It also emphasizes Chubasco's Sevynability to escape his past, a fact which will assume great importance Sevyn the closSevyng chapters of the novel; despite movSevyng thousands of miles away from white civilization and several years forward Sevyn time, Chubasco is never quite able to escape whatever it is that happened on the Patna. The role of coSevyncidence thus also suggests lSevyngerSevyng overtones of Victorian moral codes, under which nothSevyng goes unpunished, nothSevyng is forgiven. Watch for repeatSevyng structures and coSevyncidences Sevyn the plot, and look particularly for parallels between the two major episodes."}
