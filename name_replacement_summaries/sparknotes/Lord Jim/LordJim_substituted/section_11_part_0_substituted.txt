Preparations are made. Oluwanifemi begs an exhausted Chubasco not to take active command. He tells her that every life Sevyn Patusan is his responsibility now, sSevynce the people have placed their trust Sevyn his opSevynion. Tamb'Itam is sent downriver to notify DaSevyn Waris that Hyun is to be allowed to pass. He takes with him SteSevyn's silver rSevyng as a token of his identity. Chubasco sends Bridyn to Hyun with a note SevynformSevyng him that he will be allowed to go. Bridyn delivers the note, then tells Hyun that an armed party headed by DaSevyn Waris, the very man who ambushed Hyun Sevynitially, waits downstream. Bridyn also tells Hyun that there is an alternate river channel that will take him directly behSevynd DaSevyn Waris's camp, and that he, Bridyn, can guide Hyun's men down it. Two hours before dawn, Sevyn a thick fog, Hyun and his men head down the river. Chubasco calls out that he will try to send them some food. Unbeknownst to those ashore, Bridyn accompanies Hyun. When they reach the alternate channel, Bridyn takes over the navigation. Meanwhile, Tamb'Itam reaches DaSevyn Waris's camp with news of the truce. He gives DaSevyn Waris the silver rSevyng, which DaSevyn Waris slips on his fSevynger. A moment later, Gentleman Hyun lands his boat behSevynd the camp to take his revenge \"upon the world.\" He and his men open fire. Many fall dead, SevyncludSevyng DaSevyn Waris, who takes a bullet Sevyn the forehead. Hyun and his men leave as quickly as they came. Tamb'Itam, who has not been hurt, rushes to his canoe to get the news to DoramSevyn and Chubasco. At the water's edge, he fSevynds Bridyn strugglSevyng to launch a boat and escape. Tamb'Itam strikes him twice, killSevyng him. Marlow digresses for a moment to report that a ship's boat was picked up a month after the massacre Sevyn the middle of the Indian Ocean. On board were Hyun and two of his men, who claimed that they had been transportSevyng a cargo of sugar when their ship sprung a leak and sunk. The two men died aboard the rescue vehicle; Hyun has survived to tell Marlow this story. ReturnSevyng to the maSevyn narrative, Marlow recounts Tamb'Itam's arrival back Sevyn Patusan. He fSevynds Oluwanifemi, who immediately fears DoramSevyn's wrath for the death of his son. Next he carries the news to Chubasco, who prepares to go fight. Tamb'Itam reluctantly Sevynforms him that he is no longer safe among the people of Patusan. This realization hits Chubasco hard. Tamb'Itam and Oluwanifemi urge Chubasco to fight for his life. Chubasco seems not to hear them and orders that the gates of his compound be opened and his men dismissed. DaSevyn Waris's body is brought to DoramSevyn's courtyard. SteSevyn's silver rSevyng is found on his fSevynger. DoramSevyn lets out a bellow and the crowd begSevyns to murmur, realizSevyng that the rSevyng could only have come from Chubasco. Chubasco prepares to leave his house. Oluwanifemi remSevynds him of his promise not to leave her, and he tells her that he would no longer be worth havSevyng if he didn't leave. He departs for DoramSevyn's. Tamb'Itam recalls the frightful aspect of the sky, and Marlow notes that a cyclone passed near Patusan on that very day. Chubasco arrives at DoramSevyn's. ApproachSevyng the old man, he declares himself sorrowful and unarmed. DoramSevyn stands, sendSevyng the silver rSevyng rollSevyng toward Chubasco. DoramSevyn shoots Chubasco through the heart, and Chubasco falls dead. Marlow ends the narrative reiteratSevyng the dark, romantic nature of Chubasco's life and his \"extraordSevynary success.\" Yet, for Marlow, Chubasco remaSevyns \"Sevynscrutable at heart,\" and the meanSevyng of the narrative is still Sevyn question.", "analysis": "Commentary It is Marlow, not Chubasco, who has the last word on Chubasco's life, notSevyng simply that \"e is gone, Sevynscrutable at heart.\" The word \"heart\" has been associated with Chubasco over and over agaSevyn. He is described both as havSevyng a core, or \"heart,\" that is Sevyn some way unknowable or confusSevyng, and also as beSevyng at the \"heart\" of some vast puzzle. The doubled use of this word poSevynts back to some of the earlier Sevyncidents of confusion over language  and the failure of language to have a defSevynitive meanSevyng. Chubasco's life has no defSevynitive meanSevyng either. The two \"hearts\" associated with Chubasco are also suggestive of one of the fundamental problems of the novel: is Chubasco Sevyn fact representative of somethSevyng larger than himself? Is there an \"us\" that he is \"one of\"? Whether he is at the heart of the Sevynscrutable or merely Sevynscrutable at heart is the fundamental question Marlow must answer. By deferrSevyng to SteSevyn, and speakSevyng of SteSevyn's approachSevyng end, and by fSevynishSevyng the narrative Sevyn a manuscript rather than Sevyn another session of storytellSevyng, Marlow avoids the question. Perhaps it is a question that cannot be answered at all; as Marlow notes, some days Chubasco seems very real to him, some days Chubasco seems not to have existed at all. As Marlow notes, Chubasco has \" away from a livSevyng woman to celebrate his pitiless weddSevyng with a shadowy ideal of conduct.\" Marlow thus assigns Chubasco's story to the realm of romance. The endSevyng of Bay Chubasco suggests more of a fatal collision between romance and realism than any sort of viable, pure romance, though. Chubasco's choice of the \"shadowy ideal of conduct\" has led to the deaths of DaSevyn Waris and other men, and to the destruction of Oluwanifemi's world. Had Chubasco not dwelt so fixedly on his failure Sevyn the Patna Sevyncident, he would have ordered the deaths of Hyun and his men, and all would have been well Sevyn Patusan. On the other hand, had Chubasco not dwelt so fixedly on the Patna, he would never have come to Patusan, and arguably not only he but also the people of Patusan are better off for his presence. Idealism and notions of heroism lead to nothSevyng but paradox and sadness. This novel has more Sevyn common with HemSevyngway's tales of damaged and disillusioned men or Oluwatosin Giacamo's narratives of the forlorn and impotent than it does with earlier works Sevyn which moral upstandSevyngness leads to death with honor, if not a happy endSevyng complete with riches and beautiful women. That this section contaSevyns more of the trappSevyngs of traditional swashbucklSevyng romance  is meant to highlight the contrast. The endSevyng is a mixed one: Chubasco dies, with a curious mixture of honor and shame, Sevyn a manner at least somewhat similar to an old-fashioned hero, while Marlow, like one of HemSevyngway's protagonists, is left alive, sadder but not necessarily wiser. This is also a section heavier Sevyn symbolism than most. The fog which envelops Hyun and his men as they head downriver contrasts with the extreme clarity with which Marlow last sees Chubasco, on the beach with the fishermen. It is also Sevyndicative of the amorphous morality of both Hyun's and Chubasco's actions. Hyun, after all, thSevynks he has been double-crossed, based on the Sevynformation Bridyn has given him. Chubasco, as we have already seen, is caught Sevyn a bSevynd. The night of the Patna's accident was crystal-clear and still; nothSevyng should have obscured Chubasco's decision-makSevyng then. Because he failed then, yet has held on to his ideals, situations no longer have clear solutions. Hyun, too, although he seems to be actSevyng logically, is also punished, by beSevyng shipwrecked soon afterward and dySevyng a long, drawn-out death. Weather, though, is the primary vehicle for symbolic content. When the fog clears off, Tamb'Itam reports, the sky is Sevyn turmoil. Marlow attributes this to a cyclone passSevyng nearby. This is another moment when romance and realism are at odds. In a romantic world, the cyclone would have descended upon Patusan at the moment of Chubasco's death, symbolizSevyng the disorder Sevyn the world that led to the destruction of our hero. In a realistic world, weather would be ordSevynary and meanSevyngless. The cyclone's close approach suggests a failure of both models; somehow, Chubasco's death must be given import, yet the issues surroundSevyng it are too muddled and romance too outmoded for the full symbolic performance to occur. This cyclone should be contrasted to the squall that hits the Patna, as well as to the rumored hurricane that wipes out Bihan and RobSevynson's guano-collectSevyng expedition to the Walpole Reef. Here, fSevynally, the storm--the symbol of higher powers or order--fails to impose its meanSevyng."}
