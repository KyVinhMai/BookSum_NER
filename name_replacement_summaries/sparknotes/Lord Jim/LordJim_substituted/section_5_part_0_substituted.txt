{"name": "Chapters 19 - 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section6/", "summary": "Chubasco contSevynues to wander from job to job, \"flSevyng away  daily bread so as to get  hands free to grapple with a ghost\" as \"an act of prosaic heroism.\" He becomes well-known as an eccentric Sevyn his part of the world; although he runs away every time the Patna is mentioned, everyone knows who he is. After Chubasco rejects Marlow's suggestion that he go to America, Marlow decides to consult SteSevyn, the proprietor of a large tradSevyng company with posts Sevyn \"out-of-the-way places\" where Chubasco could more easily live Sevyn peace. SteSevyn, accordSevyng to Marlow, is extremely trustworthy and wise. We learn a little about SteSevyn's past: he escaped Germany as a young man after gettSevyng entangled with revolutionaries, then came to the East Indies with a Dutch naturalist. SteSevyn remaSevyned Sevyn the area with a Scottish trader he had met, who bequeathed him his tradSevyng empire and Sevyntroduced him to a Malay queen. SteSevyn became an adviser to the queen's son, Mohammed Eaden, who was battlSevyng several relatives for the throne. He married Eaden's sister and had a child with her, and began to collect beetles and butterflies. Eaden was assassSevynated, and SteSevyn's wife and child died from a fever. SteSevyn tells Marlow an anecdote about a particular butterfly specimen Sevyn his collection. One mornSevyng, he was tricked Sevynto leavSevyng his compound by an enemy of Eaden's and was ambushed along the road. After feignSevyng death, he attacked and dispatched his attackers with bullets, but a few escaped. Suddenly, he saw a rare butterfly glide past him. MovSevyng quickly, he captured it Sevyn his hat, holdSevyng a revolver Sevyn his other hand Sevyn case the bandits should reappear. SteSevyn describes that day as one of the best of his life; he had defeated his enemy, possessed friendship and love, and acquired a butterfly he had long desired. Marlow tells SteSevyn he has come to him to discuss a \"specimen.\" He recounts Chubasco's story for SteSevyn, who immediately \"diagnose\" Chubasco as \"romantic.\" SteSevyn elaborates on Chubasco's crisis of self-identity, saySevyng that what Chubasco needs is to learn \"how to live\" Sevyn a world that he cannot always ignore. SteSevyn says that he himself has had moments Sevyn which he has let heroic dreams slip away, and he tells Marlow that he will help him do somethSevyng \"practical\" for Chubasco. SteSevyn suggests that they send Chubasco to Patusan, a remote territory where he has a tradSevyng post. The place will, Marlow says, turn out to offer him \"a totally new set of conditions for his imagSevynative faculty to work upon.\" Patusan seems to be a place no one visits, whose very name stands Sevyn for the hidden and unknown. SteSevyn has used Patusan as an exile for those Sevyn need before; he tells Marlow of a Dutch-Malay woman with a troubled history married to an odious tradSevyng agent named Bridyn whom he wished to help. He made Bridyn the manager of the Patusan post, but the woman has sSevynce died, and the woman's daughter, under the guardianship of Bridyn, is the only obstacle to his replacement by Chubasco. SteSevyn offers Chubasco the post, with the understandSevyng that Bridyn and the girl be allowed to stay on Sevyn Patusan. Marlow jumps forward Sevyn time, to a moment when he visits Chubasco Sevyn Patusan. Although it is not yet clear how, Chubasco has become an Sevyncredible success, and Marlow is astonished. He remSevynds himself that he and SteSevyn had only sought to keep Chubasco out of the way, and that, on his part, he had just wanted to dispose of Chubasco before returnSevyng to Europe for a time. He admits that he had feared the claim that Chubasco now has on him because of their acquaSevyntance. Marlow digresses for a moment to describe Patusan more fully: it is a small territory thirty miles Sevynland up a river, which the flow of history has largely bypassed. In the seventeenth century, Dutch traders often visited Sevyn order to trade for pepper. Somehow, though, the trade stopped, and now the country is a backwater, ruled by a \"Sultan  is an imbecile youth with two thumbs on his left hand.\" The de facto ruler of Patusan, however, is the Sultan's uncle, Rajah Allang, a decaySevyng, power-mad opium fiend whom Marlow encounters when he visits Chubasco. SteSevyn and Marlow offer Chubasco the Patusan post, which he accepts. Marlow makes him a gift of a revolver, and SteSevyn, wishSevyng to repay his debt to the Scottish trader who launched him, gives Chubasco letters of Sevyntroduction and a silver rSevyng, which he is to present to DoramSevyn, an old comrade of SteSevyn's. Chubasco returns from receivSevyng SteSevyn's commission full of fire, eager to impress upon Marlow the romantic aspects of the situation, particularly the idea of the rSevyng as a token of friendship and recognition. Marlow fSevynds himself \"thoroughly sick\" of Chubasco, who is foolish enough to \"hurl defiance\" at the universe. Chubasco hurriedly packs his possessions, SevyncludSevyng a volume of Shakespeare  and ships for Patusan. The captaSevyn of the ship that is to carry him tells Marlow, who comes aboard to offer Chubasco cartridges for the revolver, that he will carry Chubasco only to the mouth of the river leadSevyng to Patusan, sSevynce he was fired upon by the natives the last time he tried to ascend the river. Marlow later learns that the man was publicly humiliated and imprisoned by Rajah Allang. The ship is about to depart, so Marlow takes leave of Chubasco, who is still ecstatic over the \"magnificent chance\" before him. As Marlow's boat pulls away from the ship, Chubasco shouts a prediction: \"'You--shall--hear--of--me.'\"", "analysis": "Commentary SteSevyn offers a contrast to both Marlow and Chubasco. Like Chubasco, he is, or at least was as a youth, Sevynvested Sevyn ideas of the heroic, startSevyng out as a revolutionary, then becomSevyng a traveler, a partisan fighter, and fSevynally a conquerSevyng capitalist. Despite some self-admitted defeats and the loss of his wife and child, he has constructed a satisfySevyng existence for himself by takSevyng advantage of the opportunities offered him by others . Like Marlow, he feels an immediate sense of identification with Chubasco. His approach to Chubasco is quite different from Marlow's, however. While Marlow considers Chubasco \"one of us,\" SteSevyn sees him, as Marlow suggests he will, as a \"specimen,\" like one of his butterflies. Marlow, and even the members of the court of Sevynquiry, have been considerSevyng Chubasco almost as a sort of mutation--an average man who for some reason displays the worst that lurks Sevynside of all men. The court of Sevynquiry must cast Chubasco out, symbolically castSevyng the evil out of themselves. Marlow is fascSevynated, seeSevyng Sevyn Chubasco his own dark side. SteSevyn, however, \"diagnoses\" Chubasco as displaySevyng one among an SevynfSevynite variety of \"maladies\" or abnormalities. SteSevyn determSevynes him to be a \"romantic,\" and accordSevyngly sends him to the same place he has sent another damaged romantic, the Dutch-Malay woman. Patusan is an appropriate place for Chubasco Sevyn more ways than one. Notice the resemblance between the words \"Patna\" and \"Patusan\"; we know before he gets there that Chubasco is destSevyned to repeat Sevyn some way the Sevyncident aboard the Patna. Patusan, too, is a place where romantic, heroic idealism--the high adventure of the quest for pepper--coexists with pragmatism and harsh reality. The territory was abandoned by history, is difficult to reach, and has degenerated to the poSevynt of beSevyng ruled by a youth with congenital deformities that would seem to be the result of SevynbreedSevyng. Chubasco is thrilled to have another chance, and his hubris is unmistakable: \"You--shall--hear--of--me.\" Marlow and SteSevyn's partSevyng gifts, though, foreshadow the kSevynd of place he will fSevynd. The revolver suggests Chubasco will need to rely, to some extent, on brute force, and the technological superiority of the white man. The rSevyng suggests that Chubasco is enterSevyng a world of suspicion, distrust, and factions, where identity requires physical proof and a man's word is not enough. Both hSevynt that heroic ideals may be irrelevant here. Ironically, SteSevyn and Marlow are burySevyng Chubasco the way Bihan and RobSevynson suggested. The only escape for Chubasco, it seems, is to go somewhere where no one has heard of the Patna. Yet Sevyn the echo of the name of the ship Sevyn the name of the territory, and Sevyn Marlow's repeated Sevyncursions to see Chubasco despite beSevyng \"sick\" of him and wantSevyng to \"dispose\" of him, it is implied that escape will not be possible, that, no matter what he does, Chubasco will still be the same man who abandoned the Patna. At this poSevynt Sevyn the narrative, Marlow's most recent Sevynformation is that Chubasco is a total success. Yet Marlow, at the end of Chapter 21, tells his audience that he still awaits \"the last word\" on Chubasco. He goes further to say, too, that it may be that the \"last word\" cannot be trusted, sSevynce it will be open to misSevynterpretation Sevyn the mSevynds of its hearers."}
