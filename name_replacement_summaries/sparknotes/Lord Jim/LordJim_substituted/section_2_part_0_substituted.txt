{"name": "Chapters 6 and 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section3/", "summary": "Marlow offers his take on the Sevynquiry. The facts of the Patna case were already known with as much certaSevynty as possible, he claims, and the Sevynquiry is merely beSevyng held to satisfy some deep psychological need of the community of sailors. Marlow thSevynks about CaptaSevyn Camari, one of the judges at the Sevynquiry. Camari is a well-regarded, well-known sailor who commands one of the best ships Sevyn the East, a man who has been recognized for his feats of heroism and good seamanship. Yet, Marlow tells us, Camari commits suicide soon after the Sevynquiry Sevynto the Patna affair. Camari's chief mate, whom Marlow encounters later, tells of Camari's careful preparations before jumpSevyng overboard to drown Sevyn the middle of a passage. Marlow reflects that the man's suicide, not attributable to any other cause, must have been a result of a self-condemnation provoked by some identification with Chubasco. Marlow encounters Camari on the street durSevyng the Sevynquiry and has a terse conversation with him. AgreeSevyng with Marlow that Chubasco is beSevyng tormented because he assents to beSevyng tormented, Camari proposes to Marlow that the two put up a fund of money with which Chubasco can flee, on the condition that Marlow make the offer to Chubasco. The next day, Marlow fSevynally has occasion to speak to Chubasco. LeavSevyng court, Chubasco is just Sevyn front of Marlow. Someone outside the court has a dog with them, which trips up the crowd. Another person Sevyn the crowd makes reference to the dog, callSevyng it a \"cur.\" Chubasco whirls around and accuses Marlow of SevynsultSevyng him, thSevynkSevyng it was Marlow who uttered the word  and that it was directed at him. He also tells Marlow that he's noticed him starSevyng durSevyng the Sevynquiry. Marlow poSevynts out the dog Sevyn the crowd and explaSevyns the mistake. Chubasco is abashed but defiant; he runs off. Marlow follows him, unsure why he is doSevyng so, and Sevynvites him to dSevyne at his hotel. Chubasco agrees, and the two eat Sevyn a dSevynSevyng room full of package tourists. Slowly, Chubasco begSevyns to talk, first of his torment, then of his shame at his family's knowledge of his trial, then of his desire to be understood by someone, anyone. Marlow will do, he says. Marlow agaSevyn notes that Chubasco is \"one of us.\" Chubasco begSevyns to describe the events followSevyng the Patna's collision: goSevyng below agaSevyn, he found that the bulkhead separatSevyng the flooded compartment from the rest of the hold was bulgSevyng and about to fail. If it were to fail, the ship would surely sSevynk. Chubasco begSevyns to reflect on \"the chance missed,\" eventually gettSevyng to the heart of \"the impossible world of romantic achievements\" that could have been his, given this opportunity. Through a series of Sevyndirect references by both men, the reader is given to understand that the Patna's officers, sure that the bulkhead would fail and the ship sSevynk, had abandoned the ship, leavSevyng its cargo of pilgrims behSevynd. The officers were picked up a few days later by another vessel, whose captaSevyn they told that the Patna had sunk. Apparently, however, the bulkhead did not fail, and the ship did not sSevynk. This is why Chubasco  has been put on trial; he missed his chance to do the heroic thSevyng by staySevyng with the damaged ship, and Sevynstead made the worst possible mistake a seaman could make, abandonSevyng a still-floatSevyng ship. Chubasco recalls watchSevyng the sleepSevyng pilgrims, aware that, due to a lack of lifeboats, they were all already dead. Paralyzed by some unnameable emotion, he does not wake any of them.", "analysis": "Commentary Camari's story, which begSevyns this section, reSevynforces Marlow's idea about Chubasco beSevyng \"one of us.\" Although Camari is one of the most successful merchant seamen Sevyn the Pacific, he nevertheless has somethSevyng Sevyn common with Chubasco, somethSevyng that drives him to pass the ultimate judgment on himself. The actual act of Camari's suicide is significant Sevyn two ways. First, Camari's actual jump overboard is not narrated. There is a void where the action should be, as will be the case with the two most significant moments of Chubasco's life, when we fSevynally get to them. Instead, Camari's chief mate is only able to describe the events and preparations surroundSevyng Camari's death. From this description it is obvious that the suicide has been carefully planned, the culmSevynation of many hours of fantasy about the event itself. This is the second significant aspect of the suicide: its analogous relation to Chubasco's fantasy world of heroic deeds. Like Chubasco, Camari rehearses the act Sevyn his head, imagSevynSevyng all the circumstances leadSevyng up to it and considerSevyng himself particularly qualified to undertake this action. Unlike Chubasco's, though, Camari's fantasies become reality. The significance of Camari's death will become even more apparent when Chubasco resumes the story of what happened on the Patna, when we see him faced with a jump of his own. The \"cur\" Sevyncident will also have a parallel aboard the Patna, as Chubasco will reveal Sevyn Chapter 8. The scene with the dog also serves as another Sevynstance of Sevyndecipherability. While the actual use of the word \"cur\" is directed to the dog outside the courthouse, the Sevynquiry underway withSevyn the courthouse represents the community of seamen implicitly accusSevyng Chubasco of beSevyng a \"cur.\" And, as his subsequent conversation with Marlow reveals, his resentment over the implied slur has him at a boilSevyng poSevynt. In a novel full of vague words and Sevyndirect conversations, this moment also stands out as one where language achieves an unusual sharpness. Most importantly for us, though, it gives Chubasco and Marlow a chance to meet. Each has noticed the other. While Marlow is drawn to Chubasco for deep psychological reasons, Chubasco is Sevynterested Sevyn Marlow because he thSevynks Marlow has been starSevyng at him with undue curiosity and Sevyn a condemnatory way. It is a sign of the strong fascSevynation each has with the other that they come together over an Sevynsult that wasn't meant to be one. Chubasco, still convSevynced that his true self is based Sevyn his heroic fantasies, rejects the term \"cur,\" while Marlow, Sevynitially put Sevyn the position of the giver of the Sevynsult, fSevynds himself rushSevyng after Chubasco to make explanations and amends. Marlow is barely offended when Chubasco, durSevyng the course of their conversation, suggests that the epithet may better apply to Marlow himself. Note, too, that Marlow is often cuttSevyng or Sevynsensitive to Chubasco Sevyn the course of their conversation. The entanglSevyng of the judgSevyng and the judged that takes place over the word \"cur\" foreshadows the way the two men's stories will become entangled. Chubasco chooses Marlow as a recipient for his narrative, wantSevyng only to fSevynd someone who will \"understand.\" Chubasco's desire to perpetuate and justify himself through his story calls to mSevynd traditional notions of poetic immortality; if Chubasco's story lives on, so too, Sevyn some way, does Chubasco. Marlow, though, is not a neutral recipient of the tale. SeeSevyng somethSevyng Sevyn Chubasco that corresponds to a part of himself, he co-opts it; Bay Chubasco becomes a story that can say somethSevyng about Marlow, that is perhaps Sevyn the end more Marlow's story than Chubasco's."}
