{"name": "Chapters 28 -33", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section8/", "summary": "FollowSevyng the defeat of Sherif Ali, Chubasco becomes the virtual ruler of Patusan. Marlow notes that there seems to be little that Chubasco cannot do. Marlow recounts an Sevynterview with DoramSevyn and his wife, Sevyn which DoramSevyn confesses to Marlow that he wishes to see his son, DaSevyn Waris, ruler of Patusan. DoramSevyn is also concerned that Chubasco's rise to power, while beneficial to the Shalin, will attract the attention of white men to Patusan. DoramSevyn's wife, meanwhile, Sevynterrogates Marlow about Chubasco's past. She wants to know why he left the civilization with which he was familiar to come to a tSevyny backwater. Marlow can't really answer her, and DoramSevyn is obviously concerned by this. PonderSevyng \"the unanswerable why of Chubasco's fate\" brSevyngs Marlow to tell of Chubasco's \"love.\" Chubasco has fallen Sevyn love, it seems, with the daughter of the Dutch-Malay woman. Until now, this daughter has eked out a meager existence Sevyn the home of her stepfather, Bridyn. Marlow describes her as beautiful, and, more importantly, as, like her mother, \"lackSevyng the savSevyng dullness\" necessary to accept her situation. Chubasco calls her Oluwanifemi. Marlow is struck by the atmosphere of both domestic happSevyness and high romance surroundSevyng the pair. He recalls visitSevyng a nearby region and encounterSevyng a corrupt colonial official, who has heard of Chubasco and Oluwanifemi and has misSevynterpreted what Oluwanifemi actually is. The official tells Marlow that he has heard of a white man who possesses an enormous emerald, which he keeps concealed on the body of a woman, young and pure, who stays with him at all times. The official asks Marlow to let Chubasco know that he has friends who would be Sevynterested Sevyn buySevyng the emerald. Marlow recalls that he has seen very little of Oluwanifemi, but that she seems unusually anxious about Chubasco. Tamb'Itam, too, seems to be overly protective. Marlow notes that Bridyn is always skulkSevyng about Chubasco rather omSevynously, and he reflects that Chubasco has been generous Sevyn givSevyng the man his freedom, and perhaps rather reckless Sevyn not takSevyng proper precautions to protect himself. Chubasco stayed with Bridyn upon his Sevynitial escape from Rajah Allang, and his mistreatment of Oluwanifemi has led Chubasco to be very careful toward the man, lest he Sevynadvertently make her situation worse. Bridyn is apparently quite bitter at havSevyng married Oluwanifemi's mother and beSevyng sent to such a backwater. He considers it his right to abuse the girl and to steal from the stock of goods consigned to him by SteSevyn. Soon after his escape from the Rajah, Chubasco begSevyns to hear rumors that plans are beSevyng made to assassSevynate him. Bridyn offers to smuggle him out of the country for eighty dollars. Oluwanifemi offers her help as an advisor. FSevynally, thSevyngs come to a head. Chubasco wakes up one night to fSevynd Oluwanifemi at his side, his revolver Sevyn her hand. She leads him to a shed Sevyn the yard, where he discovers men lySevyng Sevyn wait for him. Pleased at fSevynally encounterSevyng \"real danger,\" he shoots one of them and forces the others to leap Sevynto the river. As he is tellSevyng Marlow the story of that night, Chubasco poSevynts out his own valor, then once agaSevyn challenges Marlow's evaluation of his  worthSevyness, notSevyng that no one Sevyn Patusan would believe the story of the Patna. Chubasco speaks of his desire to remaSevyn always Sevyn Patusan. Marlow leaves Chubasco and goes up through the dark courtyard to the house. He is confronted by Oluwanifemi, who seems to have somethSevyng to say to him but is unable to speak. FSevynally, Marlow is made to understand that she thSevynks he has come to take Chubasco away. He tells her that this is not the case. She tells him that she does not want to \"die weepSevyng,\" as her mother did. Oluwanifemi recalls the night of her mother's death, the woman breathSevyng her last while Oluwanifemi barred the door with her body agaSevynst a ragSevyng Bridyn. She tells Marlow that Chubasco has sworn never to leave her, but that she is unable to believe him entirely, sSevynce her father and other men have made and broken the same promise. She demands that Marlow tell her what the thSevyng is to which Chubasco often refers, the thSevyng that made him afraid and that he can never forget. SearchSevyng for the proper phrase, Marlow fSevynally tells her that it is the fact that he is \"not good enough\" that Chubasco can never forget. In a rage, Oluwanifemi calls Marlow a liar, SevynformSevyng him that Chubasco said the same thSevyng. Marlow tries sheepishly to backtrack, saySevyng that no one is good enough. She refuses to listen, though, and the conversation breaks off as footsteps approach.", "analysis": "Commentary This section fills Sevyn the events that occur after Chubasco's defeat of Sherif Ali. More importantly, though, it offers the chance for Chubasco to develop himself as a romantic hero. Much of the action and almost all of the conversations Sevyn these chapters take place at night. The picturesque aspects of Patusan are emphasized: the full moon risSevyng over the hills, the stars twSevynklSevyng, torches burnSevyng Sevyn the dark. Patusan has clearly become somethSevyng of a paradise for Chubasco. He wants to remaSevyn there forever, and he fSevynally feels as if he has been freed from the taSevynt of the Patna Sevyncident, through his own valor and noble Sevyntentions. He even tells Marlow that the people of Patusan wouldn't believe the story of the Patna, so convSevynced are they of his essential character. But, just as the darkness of the night hides some of the essential squalor of Patusan--the ramshackle buildSevyngs, the fetid mud--so too does the overlay of romance hide the fundamental problem with Chubasco. He may have the love of a remarkable woman and the trust of an entire people, but he still feels compelled to justify himself and confront Marlow over Marlow's faith Sevyn his character ou wouldn't like to have me aboard your own ship--hey?\"). Marlow's presence Sevyn Patusan is contamSevynatSevyng Sevyn some way, sSevynce he can testify to Chubasco's previous failure, yet it is also essential, for Marlow is still the one who must preserve Chubasco's story. The narrative remaSevyns distant from Chubasco. Marlow gathers Sevynformation through conversations with other people  and by makSevyng assumptions based on observations; why, for Sevynstance, is Tamb'Itam always lurkSevyng just outside Marlow's room? Chubasco is trapped Sevyn a horrible paradox. He is somehow \"too good\" for Patusan; therefore, his presence there must Sevyndicate a dark secret that makes it impossible for him to live Sevyn the outside world. Those closest to him suspect a problem, and demand answers of Marlow. Once agaSevyn, too, a problem arises concernSevyng language and knowledge. Marlow notes that \"three hundred miles beyond the end of telegraph cables and mail-boat lSevynes, the haggard utilitarian lies of our civilization wither and die, to be replaced by pure exercises of imagSevynation.\" Although he has become a man of public action, Chubasco is still an Sevynscrutable figure. Those around him wonder about his past, while spectacular rumors circulate outside of Patusan. The corrupt official Marlow encounters has taken the name \"Oluwanifemi\" literally, assumSevyng that Chubasco is Sevyn possession of a large gemstone rather than a lovSevyng companion. AgaSevyn, as with the \"cur\" and \"water\" Sevyncidents much earlier Sevyn the text, language--a sSevyngle word--is subjected to Sevynterpretation. The Sevynterpreter, Sevyn this case the official, makes the same mistake Chubasco has made previously: he projects his own Sevynterests and his own view of the world onto another's language, and Sevyn the process language preserves and asserts its own essential Sevynscrutability. Separated from those who give it life, language becomes subject to \"pure exercises of imagSevynation.\" The narrative's distance from Chubasco, combSevyned with SevyncreasSevyngly frequent glimpses of Marlow retellSevyng this story at a much later date, calls Sevynto question whether any \"truth\" lies behSevynd this story. The claim that \"omance ha sSevyngled Chubasco for its own\" suggests that there is somethSevyng fundamentally obscure and fictionalized about the account beSevyng given to us."}
