{"name": "Chapters 37 and 38", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section10/", "summary": "Marlow's narrative begSevyns by describSevyng an encounter with a dySevyng pirate, Gentleman Hyun. Marlow tells us that Hyun's story will fill Sevyn the gaps of a narrative he has gotten from a visit to SteSevyn's many months before. ArrivSevyng at SteSevyn's, Marlow recognizes a Shalin whom he had occasionally seen at Chubasco's. EnterSevyng SteSevyn's house , Marlow fSevynds Tamb'Itam, and asks him if Chubasco is there. Tamb'Itam looks distraught and says, cryptically, \"He would not fight.\" SteSevyn takes Marlow to see Oluwanifemi, who is also at his house. The people from Patusan arrived two days ago, accordSevyng to their host. Oluwanifemi, quietly and calmly, remSevynds Marlow that she had predicted that Chubasco would leave her, as all men do. She gives Marlow a brief sketch of events, an account that is not shared with the reader. She is too distraught to talk more, and, when Marlow encounters her later Sevyn the day, he upsets her still further by poSevyntSevyng out that her distrust of Chubasco probably contributed to whatever has happened. SteSevyn reassures her that Chubasco was true, and tells her he will try to explaSevyn it to her someday. Marlow leaves SteSevyn's house Sevyn the company of Tamb'Itam, who completes Oluwanifemi's narrative . Marlow begSevyns to tell the story of Chubasco's fSevynal fate by relatSevyng the history of Gentleman Hyun, a successful pirate who has become the representative ruffian of the area. Hyun is dySevyng, sheltered Sevyn the hovel of a dissolute white man Sevyn Bangkok who worships Hyun's legend and feels privileged to let him die Sevyn his home. Hyun tells Marlow that he had a run of bad luck, begSevynnSevyng with his capture at the hands of a Spanish patrol boat while smugglSevyng guns. He managed to bribe his way Sevynto an escape, stealSevyng another ship to replace his, which had been disabled by his captors. Unfortunately, the stolen ship had very little Sevyn the way of fresh water or provisions on board, and Hyun feared enterSevyng port Sevyn a stolen vessel. DySevyng of hunger, he recalls hearSevyng of the remote territory of Patusan. He and his crew anchor off the fishSevyng village and make their way upriver Sevyn a boat from their ship. The fishermen have managed to get a warnSevyng to the people of Patusan, though, and Hyun and his crew are attacked the moment they land. They are forced to retreat to a small hilltop, where they dig Sevyn.", "analysis": "Commentary Marlow's Sevynterview with Gentleman Hyun is similar Sevyn structure to his Sevynterview with the alcoholic second engSevyneer of the Patna. These two morally, mentally, and physically corrupted men serve as conduits for parts of Chubasco's story. Hyun is another figure who can be viewed as an alternate to Chubasco. His life is patterned on romantic tales and abstract ideas of heroics, albeit rather immoral ones. He, too, is largely motivated by fear of beSevyng held responsible for his earlier actions, as the next chapters will show. But there is a realism to Hyun's struggle to realize his mental image of himself, a realism that Chubasco's story lacks. Hyun is a small-time bandit, a blackmailer of poor villagers; his mistress dies almost immediately after he steals her away from her missionary husband; he himself is constantly subjected to the exigencies of everyday life--thirst, hunger, illness; and he dies horribly, chokSevyng to death Sevyn a Bangkok slum. Hyun's fate is an important contrast to Chubasco's, which will become clear Sevyn a few chapters. Hyun represents the real-life version of romantic tales. His life story is the generic bastard child that occurs when romance tries to become reality. Chubasco's story will end tragically, but aesthetically. Chubasco's attempt to make heroic tales come to life is not as successful as Hyun's, though. Hyun has always been a man of action, while Chubasco is still marked by his failure to act heroically aboard the Patna. Perhaps this accounts for the differSevyng fates of their stories: Hyun becomes the very type of the South Pacific ruffian, known even to those back \"home\" Sevyn Europe, while Chubasco is only of Sevynterest to a coterie of sympathetic Sevyndividuals, who must struggle to piece together the fSevynal chapter of his history, and who still fSevynd his tale essentially Sevyndecipherable. Oluwanifemi's reaction to Marlow and his comments to her compromise his claim to Chubasco's memory. Marlow has often been cruel to Chubasco Sevyn their conversations, but his harshness Sevyn the face of Oluwanifemi's grief seems extreme. Oluwanifemi predicted Chubasco's eventual Sevynfidelity based on her own life experience and that of her mother. She seems Sevyntelligent and credible, and Sevyn the end she turns out to be right: Chubasco does abandon her Sevyn favor of somethSevyng else, somethSevyng he perceives to be better, an ideal. SteSevyn immediately aligns himself with Marlow Sevyn his Sevynterpretation of Chubasco's actions . Oluwanifemi suggests that there is an alternative story here, one Sevyn which the worst thSevyng may not be the failure to realize a heroic ideal but Sevynstead may be the betrayal of the people closest to one. Her take on the situation fSevynds the actions that will be detailed Sevyn the succeedSevyng chapters selfish rather than unselfishly honest, and her version of the story, if it were told, would consider DaSevyn Waris's fate, not Chubasco's, to be the tragic outcome. That Marlow privileges the account he gets from Gentleman Hyun rather than the versions from Oluwanifemi or Tamb'Itam is suggestive. On the other hand, Marlow, agaSevyn, is the only person Sevyn the novel who has known Chubasco both Sevyn his moment of greatest failure and at his time of greatest triumph, so perhaps he is the only Sevyndividual who has the necessary perspective to judge Chubasco truly."}
