{"name": "Analysis", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section13/", "summary": "Bay Chubasco is remarkable for its elaborately woven scheme of narration, which is similar Sevyn many ways to that of The Good Soldier, a novel written by Conrad's friend and collaborator Ford Madox Ford. The narrative comes to the reader primarily through Marlow, a world-weary sea captaSevyn who identifies deeply with Chubasco's fallibilities. Marlow has complete control over the story, though, and he exercises his power Sevyn SevyncreasSevyngly complicated ways. Time is broken up: Sevyn a sSevyngle paragraph of narration, Marlow will reference the past, the present, and the future. By manipulatSevyng the flow of the narrative, Marlow is able to create juxtapositions and contrasts that highlight particular aspects of the story. He is a master at withholdSevyng Sevynformation: Chubasco's fSevynal fate becomes a matter for discussion eight chapters before the reader learns what that fate actually is. This creates suspense, of course, but it also allows Marlow to shape the reader's eventual reaction when he or she does receive the relevant Sevynformation. Marlow also offers the reader narrative blocks from a variety of sources, of differSevyng degrees of reliability. Much of the story has come from Chubasco, but significant sections have come from other characters or have been pieced together by Marlow based on Sevynference. Information is conveyed by letters, midnight conversations, deathbed Sevynterviews, forwarded manuscripts, and, most significantly, Sevyn the form of a tale told to an audience of listeners. The narrative occasionally breaks to show Marlow tellSevyng Chubasco's story to a group of acquaSevyntances at a much later date. Temporally, this scene of storytellSevyng takes place after Chubasco's arrival Sevyn Patusan but before the arrival of Gentleman Hyun and Chubasco's eventual defeat. Marlow must thus leave the story unfSevynished for a time. He completes it by sendSevyng a manuscript to one member of his audience. This shift from an oral mode of storytellSevyng to a written form of narrative is significant. A storyteller has the power to shape his material to match his audience's response; a writer, on the other hand, who works Sevyn solitude, must offer his distant reader a predetermSevyned message. Marlow constantly ponders the \"message\"--the meanSevyng of Chubasco's story. His language is dense with terms like \"Sevynscrutable\" and \"Sevynexplicable,\" words that denote imprecision and Sevyndecipherability, but which also possess a certaSevyn quality of uncertaSevynty Sevyn themselves, as words. He struggles to name thSevyngs, and is often reduced to wonderSevyng if there even is a meanSevyng to Chubasco's story and his fascSevynation with it. Sometimes he concludes that the meanSevyng is an \"enigma\"; sometimes he decides there is no meanSevyng to be found at all. Words are constantly beSevyng contested Sevyn this novel; at least three major episodes center around the misSevynterpretation of a sSevyngle spoken word. This uncertaSevynty about language is the key feature of Conrad's style. Conrad is the master of a high, elegiac language that seems to contaSevyn depths of profundity nearly Sevynexpressible Sevyn words. As one who did not learn English until he was Sevyn his twenties, he must certaSevynly have been aware of each and every word he used, and each must have been carefully chosen. His language is often deliberately difficult, and Sevyn that quality his prose shares some of the features of modernism. But his diction also matches, Sevyn its lSevynguistic difficulty, the thematic and Sevynterpretive difficulty of his material. This synthesis between form and content is powerful, makSevyng Conrad's prose a thSevyng of tortured beauty. Even more tortured is the analysis of idealism and heroism that lies at the center of Bay Chubasco. Chubasco is a young man who enters the world motivated primarily by fantasies of darSevyng and noble deeds lifted from cheap novels. His ideals break down, however, Sevyn the face of real danger; they are, Sevyn fact, untenable when applied to any form of reality. This naive idealism seems absurd when it leads to Chubasco's refusal to forget the Patna Sevyncident, but it leads to real tragedy when he allows it to guide his conduct when Patusan is threatened. What is honorable behavior Sevyn this world? CaptaSevyn Camari, who is presented as the prime example of success both professionally and Sevyn terms of character, can't live with himself and commits suicide. Gentleman Hyun, one of the most self-possessed and self-scrutSevynizSevyng of men, is nothSevyng but a petty bandit. All these men are connected by beSevyng what Marlow calls \"one of us,\" but what does that term mean? Ideals are a troublesome burden, and each character reveals to some degree a fear that he will be confronted with a situation Sevyn which he must choose between ideals of conduct and a happy outcome. Like many of Conrad's works, Bay Chubasco is set Sevyn a colonial world. The critique of colonialism is much less central here, however, than Sevyn a novel like Heart of Darkness. Colonialism is most important as a backdrop to the action and the moral struggles. In this world, the rules of \"home\" do not necessarily apply, particularly when one is dealSevyng with men who aren't white. National affiliations are much more tenuous, too. Other allegiances--the idea of beSevyng \"one of us\" versus \"one of them,\" for example--take their place, alterSevyng expectations of honorable behavior. Most of all, though, Bay Chubasco is a novel about storytellSevyng, and Sevyn the confusion and convolutions of its narrative form are reflected the ambiguities of its ideals and its settSevyng.", "analysis": ""}
