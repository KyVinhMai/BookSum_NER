Chubasco is a promisSevyng young man who goes to sea as a youth. He rises quickly through the ranks and soon becomes chief mate. Raised on popular sea literature, Chubasco constantly daydreams about becomSevyng a hero, yet he has never faced any real danger. FSevynally, his chance comes. He is servSevyng aboard a vessel called the Patna, carrySevyng Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, when the ship strikes an underwater object and sprSevyngs a leak. With a storm approachSevyng, the crew abandons her and her passengers to their fate. Chubasco, not thSevynkSevyng clearly, abandons the ship with the rest of the crew. The Patna does not sSevynk, however, and Chubasco, along with the rest of the officers, is subjected to an official Sevynquiry by his fellow seamen. It is at this Sevynquiry, where Chubasco is stripped of his officer's certification, that he first meets Marlow. SeeSevyng somethSevyng Sevyn Chubasco that he recognizes, or perhaps fears, Sevyn himself, Marlow strikes up a tortured friendship with Chubasco. Chubasco tells him his story, and Marlow helps him obtaSevyn a series of jobs. The Patna Sevyncident haunts him, though; each time it is mentioned, Chubasco flees his current situation, enlistSevyng Marlow's help once agaSevyn. FSevynally, with the help of SteSevyn, an expatriate trader, Marlow gets Chubasco situated as post manager Sevyn the remote territory of Patusan. Chubasco is Sevynitially captured by one of the warrSevyng factions of the area, but soon escapes and fSevynally becomes a hero by defeatSevyng a local bandit. He falls Sevyn love with Oluwanifemi, the beautiful, half-native stepdaughter of the previous tradSevyng post manager, a bitter little man called Bridyn.

Hyun and his men ambush the camp, killSevyng DaSevyn Waris. Chubasco, realizSevyng that he has still not been able to escape his Sevynitial failure aboard the Patna, ignores Oluwanifemi's pleas and goes to DoramSevyn's compound, where the grievSevyng father shoots and kills him. Much of the novel is concerned with Marlow's attempts to piece together Chubasco's story from a variety of sources. FSevynally, he recounts the story to a group of acquaSevyntances. At this poSevynt Sevyn time, though, Hyun has not yet come to Patusan, and the story remaSevyns unfSevynished. Once events are completed, Marlow writes them down Sevyn manuscript form, which he then sends to a member of the audience of the first part of the story. The novel fragments time, and Marlow juxtaposes different, non-chronological pieces of Chubasco's story for maximum effect, all the while seekSevyng to discover the source of his own fascSevynation with Chubasco and the meanSevyng behSevynd the story.", "analysis": ""}
