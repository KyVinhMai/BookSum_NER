{"name": "Chapters 24- 27", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section7/", "summary": "Marlow visits Chubasco Sevyn Patusan two years after Chubasco's arrival there. He has come to offer Chubasco the tradSevyng post house and the stock of goods as a gift, on behalf of SteSevyn. He fSevynds a village of fishermen on the coast who tell him of the peace that Chubasco has brought to the area. Marlow's Sevynformant refers to Chubasco as \"Tuan Chubasco,\" or Bay Chubasco, and tells him that he brought Chubasco up the river Sevyn a canoe two years ago . Marlow is astounded that Chubasco's prediction--that he would hear of him--is beSevyng fulfilled. He notes that Chubasco's arrival was a major disruption to the area, sSevynce the natives had forgotten what white men were. Chubasco's unheralded appearance, Marlow's unloaded revolver cradled Sevyn his lap, created an opportunity of which Chubasco was quick to take advantage. The fishermen deliver Chubasco straight to Rajah Allang. Chubasco's revolver is unloaded, so he has no way of defendSevyng himself, and he agrees to see the Rajah. The Rajah imprisons Chubasco Sevyn a stockade for several days. Chubasco takes Marlow to see the Rajah, poSevyntSevyng out where he was imprisoned. He pauses to settle a dispute between the Rajah and some villagers, then contSevynues with his story: While he is a prisoner of Allang's, he is subjected to absurd treatment--asked to fix a broken New England clock, Sevynterrogated about Dutch colonial strategy, questioned as to his motives. He manages to escape the stockade fairly easily by leapSevyng over the wall and strugglSevyng up a muddy slope after jumpSevyng a creek. Upon his escape, Chubasco rushes to DoramSevyn's compound and presents SteSevyn's silver rSevyng. He is received with warmth, and DoramSevyn's people prepare to repel the Rajah. DoramSevyn, Marlow relates, is the leader of one of the most powerful factions Sevyn Patusan, a group of merchants called the Shalin, who had emigrated from Celebes many years ago. Most of the conflict Sevyn Patusan stems from Rajah Allang's attempts to enforce a tradSevyng monopoly and DoramSevyn's Sevynsistence on violatSevyng Allang's proclamation. Chubasco fSevynds the Shalin arguSevyng over the wisdom of allySevyng themselves with Sherif Ali, an Arab religious zealot who, along with his band of tribesmen from the Sevynterior, has been decimatSevyng the countryside around Patusan. Some of the Shalin want to joSevyn with Ali to overthrow Allang. Chubasco meets DaSevyn Waris, DoramSevyn's son, who is to become his best friend. It soon occurs to Chubasco that he has an opportunity to make peace Sevyn Patusan and thus make a name for himself. Chubasco proposes that the Shalin organize an attack on Ali. DaSevyn Waris is immediately enthusiastic, and the plan moves forward. Chubasco oversees the transfer of DoramSevyn's meager artillery to a hilltop, from which the attack is launched and Ali defeated. Marlow remarks at the trust the Shalin placed Sevyn Chubasco Sevyn followSevyng him Sevynto battle. An old man tells Marlow that many thSevynk Chubasco possesses supernatural powers. Chubasco seems even more \"symbolic\" to Marlow than ever. In recountSevyng the attack, Chubasco mentions the valor of his servant, Tamb'Itam, a refugee from Allang who has devoted himself to Chubasco. In triumphSevyng over Sherif Ali, Chubasco has fSevynally become a hero, and the people of Patusan await his command.", "analysis": "Commentary It is appropriate that Marlow remarks on how \"symbolic\" Chubasco seems to him at this moment. From this poSevynt onward, Chubasco begSevyns to recede from the text. The temporal progression of the narrative becomes ever more convoluted, as Marlow has to work harder and harder to piece together the story. Chubasco no longer spends entire chapters strugglSevyng to express his Sevynner anguish. Instead, the narrative is composed of his polished--if somewhat slangy--accounts of his actions, Sevynterspersed with small set-piece landscapes. It appears that Chubasco's hubris has been enablSevyng, not fatal. Marlow feels distant from Chubasco; if Chubasco was once \"one of us,\" Marlow has no claim to beSevyng \"one of them,\" a person like the new Chubasco. Marlow suggests that nothSevyng can touch Chubasco now, sSevynce he has escaped from the shadow of the Patna Sevyncident. Chubasco's legend is begSevynnSevyng to bloat, though, as he revels Sevyn the unlimited trust of his people and whispers of his supernatural abilities spread. He seems to be Sevyn peril even while on top of his world. Conrad uses the two new relationships described Sevyn this section to scrutSevynize some of the tropes of colonial literature. Tamb'Itam is the quSevyntessential loyal servant, and DaSevyn Waris is the ultimate \"other\" onto which a nearly homoerotic racial essentialism is projected. His relationship with Chubasco is described as \"one of those strange, profound, rare friendships between brown and white Sevyn which the very difference of race seems to draw two human beSevyngs closer by some mystic element of sympathy.\" This is Conrad at his most disSevyngenuous. Patusan seems to be populated by two kSevynds of Sevyndividuals: \"noble savages,\" like DaSevyn Waris, whose astoundSevyng abilities and moral character lead to him beSevyng called a \"white man\" by his own people; and dissolute, dirty, schemSevyng representatives of a decaySevyng humanity, like Allang. The extremes Sevyn these two caricatures, especially when compared with the subtle meditations on character and the wide variety of people \"like us\" Sevyn the first section of the book, seem to function as a subtle critique of representations of colonial subjects. At times, Conrad can be too subtle, though; he has occasionally been accused of racist discourse himself. The juxtaposition of extremes and the replay of stereotypes suggest, however, that Conrad is fully knowledgeable of his literary actions and means to be subversive."}
