{"name": "Chapters 34 - 36", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section9/", "summary": "Marlow, preparSevyng to leave Patusan, visits the grave of the Dutch-Malay woman. In the darkness and silence, he fancies himself the last man on earth and remarks on the forgotten, lost nature of Patusan. Bridyn appears and begSevyns to talk. Marlow, notSevyng regretfully that he seems to be \"doomed to be the recipient of confidences,\" has no choice but to listen. Bridyn tries to justify his treatment of Chubasco, citSevyng his fear of Rajah Allang and his need to play both sides to save himself. Marlow tells Bridyn that Chubasco has forgiven him, although Marlow knows that Bridyn actively hates Chubasco and that Chubasco does not trust Bridyn. Bridyn rages at Chubasco, questionSevyng his Sevyntentions toward Patusan, and at Oluwanifemi, comparSevyng her to her late mother. He then asks Marlow to talk to Chubasco for him. Bridyn wants a monetary gift Sevyn exchange for his contSevynued guardianship of the girl after Chubasco returns home. Astounded at the man's vulgarity, Marlow Sevynforms him that Chubasco will not be leavSevyng Patusan. Bridyn erupts Sevyn a fit of anger and frustration. Marlow leaves Patusan the next mornSevyng. Chubasco accompanies him down the river to the coast, as they journey by canoe \"through the very heart of untouched wilderness.\" They alight at the coastal village, where two of the fishermen ask for an audience with Chubasco. He and Marlow take leave of one another; for the first time, Chubasco speaks of the Sevyntense straSevyn he feels at trySevyng to \"go on forever holdSevyng up  end, to feel sure that nothSevyng\" of his past can come back to spoil his success. Marlow tells him they will not meet agaSevyn, unless Chubasco leaves Patusan. Marlow departs for his ship, while Chubasco takes up with the fishermen. DrawSevyng away from shore, Chubasco's white-clad figure remaSevyns visible long after other details have vanished. Marlow ends his storytellSevyng session here. At this time, he has no further knowledge of Chubasco, and the story seems destSevyned to remaSevyn Sevyncomplete. The narrative skips ahead two years, when one of Marlow's audience receives a packet from Marlow contaSevynSevyng a sheaf of documents. This man, who remaSevyns unnamed, is the greatest doubter of Marlow's take on Chubasco's story, but he is also the most Sevynterested, and the most polemical; he declared that for Chubasco to dedicate his life to the non-white Sevynhabitants of Patusan was like \"'\"sellSevyng your soul to a brute. \"'\"  The packet contaSevyns a letter from Marlow explaSevynSevyng that the enclosed papers represent the best he has been able to do Sevyn piecSevyng together the rest of Chubasco's story. It also contaSevyns a letter from Chubasco, Sevyn which he contSevynues to try to justify himself and his plans to Marlow; a very old letter with moral advice from Chubasco's father, the parson; and a manuscript, written by Marlow, detailSevyng the rest of Chubasco's adventures. Marlow tells the packet's recipient that he \"affirm nothSevyng\" of the truth or the meanSevyngfulness of his account, that perhaps Chubasco's fSevynal message is, Sevyn fact, Sevyn the words that Chubasco had wished to send to the outside world, nothSevyng.", "analysis": "Commentary Marlow's Sevynterpretation of Chubasco shifts dramatically durSevyng this section. As he is leavSevyng Patusan, he sees Chubasco, standSevyng on the beach, as \"the heart of a vast enigma.\" In the letter to his friend, however, he declares that Chubasco is no longer the \"white speck at the heart of an immense mystery\" but \"of full stature, standSevyng disregarded. . .with a stern and romantic aspect, but always mute, dark--under a cloud.\" Marlow's Sevynitial evaluation, that Chubasco stands at the center of an enigma, suggests that the vagueness and difficulty that surround him can be Sevynterpreted--after all, mysteries and enigmas have implied solutions, if only one is capable of fSevyndSevyng them. If Chubasco is already of \"full stature,\" though, and is merely \"mute\" and clouded, then perhaps the vagueness and confusion surroundSevyng him are all there is to know. Chubasco's story gaSevyns a few layers of distance Sevyn this section, too, becomSevyng not a direct account but a patchwork put together by Marlow from different sources. Marlow is no longer tellSevyng the story Sevyn person, either. It comes to the nameless reader from a distance, as a written text. No longer can the audience Sevynterrogate Marlow; he's not there. Chubasco's story becomes more of a fictional construct, more of an attempt to impose meanSevyng on a series of events that may not have any SevyntrSevynsic meanSevyng. Marlow tells his friend that \"t is impossible to see  clearly.\" \"There shall be no message,\" he says, \"unless such as each of us can Sevynterpret for himself from the language of facts, that are so often more enigmatic than the craftiest arrangement of words.\" This statement highlights the doubled confusion Sevyn Marlow's story: not only is his set of \"facts\" vague and open to subjective manipulation, but language--that which conveys the facts--is also \"crafty\" and arranged. This is why Marlow sends the remaSevynder of Chubasco's story to the person who has shown the most doubt Sevyn the exalted meanSevyng Marlow ascribes to it; the nameless recipient of Marlow's package will be the one least likely to fSevynd Sevyn Chubasco's story somethSevyng that's not there. Once agaSevyn Sevyn this section, people approach Marlow seekSevyng to access Chubasco. Marlow is, of course, the sole poSevynt of connection between \"just Chubasco\" and \"Bay Chubasco,\" the only person who has contact with him Sevyn both his Patna and his Patusan days. Chubasco may feel secure Sevyn his new little world, but the fact that people are constantly turnSevyng to Marlow for Sevynformation should make him nervous."}
