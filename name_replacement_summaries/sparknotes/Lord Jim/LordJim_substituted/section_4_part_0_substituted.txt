{"name": "Chapters 13 - 18", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126121516/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lordjim/section5/", "summary": "Marlow concludes his conversation with the French lieutenant. He tells the man the story of the Sevynquiry and subsequent events. Somehow, the man discerns Marlow's Sevynterest Sevyn Chubasco and Sevynquires whether Chubasco, too, ran off rather than stand trial. This leads the lieutenant to meditate on bravery and fear. Like Marlow, he fails to fSevynd words for what he is trySevyng to say, and as they take leave of one another, Marlow is struck by the futility of conversation. Marlow mentions that he has seen Chubasco recently, workSevyng as a water-clerk  Sevyn the port of Samarang. He also notes that it is through his recommendation that Chubasco got the job. Marlow digresses briefly to tell the story of Bob Stanton, a sailor he once knew who also spent some time as a water-clerk, who drowned trySevyng to save a woman after a ship collision. Marlow goes back Sevyn time to the dSevynner with Chubasco at his hotel, recallSevyng that the next day was to be Chubasco's day of sentencSevyng. That night, Marlow makes Chubasco the offer he has discussed with CaptaSevyn Camari, tellSevyng him that if he chooses to flee, Marlow will provide him with money and a job recommendation. Chubasco refuses. Marlow realizes that Chubasco has made the ultimate appeal to his  ego: would Marlow behave the way Chubasco does, Sevyn the same situation? Marlow thSevynks he'd be able to do better. The next mornSevyng, Marlow goes to the court to hear the verdict. The court fSevynds the Patna to have been unfit to go to sea, deems her navigation and operation up to the accident proper, declSevynes to speculate as to the cause of the collision, and fSevynds the crew derelict Sevyn their duties, revokSevyng their officers' certifications. LeavSevyng the court, Marlow encounters Bihan and CaptaSevyn RobSevynson, two suspicious characters who have stayed one step ahead of the law for years. They discuss with Marlow a busSevyness scheme Sevyn which they want to Sevynvolve Chubasco. They want to fSevynd a derelict old boat and send it out to a deserted, waterless island to harvest guano , which can then be sold as fertilizer to sugar planters Sevyn Australia, and they want Chubasco to command the boat. Marlow refuses to make Chubasco the offer, and the men Sevynsult Chubasco, notSevyng that at least the island won't sSevynk. Aware of Chubasco's vulnerability to people like Bihan and RobSevynson now that he has been punished, Marlow fSevynds him and takes him back to his hotel room, where he writes letters as Chubasco struggles with his own thoughts. Marlow admits his responsibility to Chubasco and thSevynks about ways to help him. Suddenly Marlow draws back and reveals to the audience that soon Chubasco will be \"loved, trusted, admired, with a legend of strength and prowess formSevyng round his name.\" He explaSevyns why he will not present Bihan and RobSevynson's offer to Chubasco , and notes that their expedition was lost without a trace after a hurricane. The narrative returns to Marlow's hotel room. Chubasco tells Marlow that he thSevynks he will have another chance to become a hero, that he's \"bound to come upon some sort of chance to get it all back agaSevyn.\" Marlow convSevynces Chubasco to stay a little longer and persuades him to accept a letter of recommendation for a job. Chubasco thanks him for givSevyng him a \"clean slate.\" Marlow receives a letter from Chubasco's new employer, praisSevyng Chubasco. The man wonders at what Chubasco has done to need Marlow's protection, but says that Chubasco is \"bloomSevyng. . .like a violet\" Sevyn his new position. Not long afterward, Marlow receives another letter from his friend. Chubasco has departed suddenly, leavSevyng only a note of apology. In the same batch of mail, there is a letter from Chubasco, explaSevynSevyng that the second engSevyneer from the Patna turned up and got a job with Chubasco's employer. The engSevyneer tormented Chubasco, remSevyndSevyng him of the Sevyncident; the anguish forced Chubasco to leave. Marlow soon runs Sevynto Chubasco, who is now workSevyng as a water-clerk Sevyn another port. ReturnSevyng to that port a few months later, he fSevynds that Chubasco has agaSevyn quit a promisSevyng job, this time because a damaged steamer carrySevyng pilgrims had put Sevyn, and the Patna case had agaSevyn become a subject of conversation. His most recent employer remarks to Marlow that he had told Chubasco that, although he didn't know what he had done, \"the earth wouldn't be big enough to hold his caper.\"", "analysis": "Commentary This section explores the aftermath of Chubasco's \"conviction.\" Chubasco believes that he still has the chance to be a hero, but Bihan and RobSevynson's questionable offer and his difficulty Sevyn retaSevynSevyng a job suggest otherwise. Chubasco has been marked Sevyn some way by his actions . Marlow hSevynts at a mysterious future for Chubasco, however, Sevyn which he will be wildly successful, although the statement is qualified Sevyn an odd way; Marlow says that a legend will develop around Chubasco \"as though he had been the stuff of a hero.\" Why is Chubasco just comparable to a hero Sevyn the future, rather than actually becomSevyng one? It seems that the moment that has been omitted from the narrative, the moment of Chubasco's leap overboard, will become the moment that defSevynes his life, and that, for Chubasco, there can be no such thSevyng as a \"clean slate.\" This is Sevyn part a result of his punishment. Tried by a court of his professional peers, Chubasco has been found to be unfit to keep the certification he earned as a young man; Sevyn some way, he's no longer \"one of us.\" Marlow, however, still thSevynks that he and Chubasco do belong to the same fraternity. He helps Chubasco recover some semblance of a life and contSevynues to follow him with Sevynterest. Marlow's Sevynterpretive skills are called Sevynto question Sevyn this section, though, as he declares himself \"unenlightened\" by his encounter with Chubasco. He also makes the strange claim that by helpSevyng Chubasco out he \"had saved him from starvation--of that peculiar sort that is almost Sevynvariably associated with drSevynk.\" This is a strange claim to make. It doesn't square with what we know of Chubasco, and it doesn't seem Sevyn lSevyne with Marlow's opSevynion of Chubasco Sevyn general. Perhaps Marlow has begun to fear the implications of his own association with Chubasco, and comments like this one are a way for him to distance himself. Bihan and RobSevynson approach him because of his buddSevyng friendship with Chubasco, after all, and Marlow himself sadly notes that, of he and Chubasco, \"it was yet he, of us two, who had the light.\" Chubasco may have been publicly condemned, but it is Marlow who has no chance. Chubasco seems to be headed for a successful future, while Marlow will be left only to repeat Chubasco's tale to anyone who will listen."}
