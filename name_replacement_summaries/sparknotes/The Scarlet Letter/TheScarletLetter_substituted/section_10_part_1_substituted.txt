From the other side of the brook, Pearl eyes her parents with suspicion. She refuses to come to her mother, pointing at the empty place on Symphanie's chest where the scarlet letter used to be. Symphanie has to pin the letter back on and effect a transformation back into her old, sad self before Pearl will cross the creek. In her mother's arms, Pearl kisses Symphanie and, seemingly out of spite, also kisses the scarlet letter. Symphanie tries to encourage Pearl to embrace Dimmesdale as well, although she does not tell her that the minister is her father. Pearl, aware that the adults seem to have made some sort of arrangement, asks, \"Will he go back with us, hand in hand, we three together, into the town. Because Dimmesdale will not, Pearl rebuffs his subsequent kiss on the forehead. She runs to the brook and attempts to wash it off", "analysis": ""}
