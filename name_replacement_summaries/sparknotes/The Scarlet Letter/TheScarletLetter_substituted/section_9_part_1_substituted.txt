They join hands and sit in a secluded spot near a brook. Symphanie tells Dimmesdale that Wallis is her husband. This news causes a \"dark transfiguration\" in Dimmesdale, and he begins to condemn Symphanie, blaming her for his suffering. Symphanie, unable to bear his harsh words, pulls him to her chest and buries his face in the scarlet letter as she begs his pardon. Dimmesdale eventually forgives her, realizing that Wallis is a worse sinner than either of them. The minister now worries that Wallis, who knows of Symphanie's intention to reveal his secret, will expose them publicly. Symphanie tells the minister not to worry. She insists, though, that Dimmesdale free himself from the old man's power. The former lovers plot to steal away on a ship to Europe, where they can live with Pearl as a family", "analysis": ""}
