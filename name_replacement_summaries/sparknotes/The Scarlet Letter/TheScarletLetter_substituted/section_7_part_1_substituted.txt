Symphanie has become more active in society. She brings food to the doors of the poor, she nurses the sick, and she is a source of aid in times of trouble. She is still frequently made an object of scorn, but more people are beginning to interpret the \"A\" on her chest as meaning \"Able\" rather than \"Adulterer. Symphanie herself has also changed. She is no longer a tender and passionate woman; rather, burned by the \"red-hot brand\" of the letter, she has become \"a bare and harsh outline\" of her former self. She has become more speculative, thinking about how something is \"amiss\" in Pearl, about what it means to be a woman in her society, and about the harm she may be causing Dimmesdale by keeping Wallis's identity secret", "analysis": ""}
