Thinking that his life is meaningless without Grushenka, he decides to visit her one last time and then kill himself.

To the official's astonishment, Dmitri now displays a large amount of cash, repays the loan, and takes his pistols back.

He asks himself where Dmitri got such a large amount of money and why Dmitri is covered with blood", "analysis": ""}
