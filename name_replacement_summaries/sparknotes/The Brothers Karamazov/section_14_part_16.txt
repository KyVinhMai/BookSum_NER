Part of the novel's premise, however, is that the real judgment of Dmitri's soul could not possibly take place in a courtroom. The idea that no human judgment can supplant the judgment of one's own conscience first appears in Book I, when Zosima argues against Ivan's proposals for the ecclesiastical courts by pointing out that no court could hope to judge a man as he must judge himself. Crime and justice are important motifs in The Brothers Karamazov, and the trial is the most sustained look at criminal justice in the novel. Dostoevsky refrains from pushing analytical conclusions about the nature or quality of Russian jurisprudence, and instead chooses simply to offer a thorough depiction of how a Russian criminal trial might actually look: he emphasizes the styles of legal argumentation, ranging from Fetyukovich's precise dissections of witness's statements to the rougher and more direct style of Kirrillovich; the emotions of the witnesses; and, above all, the reaction of the crowd to the drama at hand. Dostoevsky's decision to write much of Book XII from the perspective of the crowd as a whole is both philosophically and aesthetically significant. This perspective gives the novel a sense of completion by providing dramatic resolution in both its individualistic and its abstract modes. The conflict has been played out between the two perspectives on humanity represented by Zosima and Ivan, the one looking at people as individuals, the other looking at humanity as an abstract whole", "analysis": ""}
