A man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern any truth either in himself or anywhere around him. From the Author In a short introduction, the author--writing in the somewhat comical and haphazard style employed by the narrator throughout the novel--poses the question of why anyone should read his story, which he describes as the \"biography\" of Alyosha. He concludes that the story describes an odd man who nevertheless captures something essential about his time. The author apologizes for the fragmentary nature of his story, but says that he hopes readers will read it to the end. He also apologizes for wasting his readers' time with a superfluous author's note", "analysis": ""}
