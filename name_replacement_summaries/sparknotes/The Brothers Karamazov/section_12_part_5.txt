The pale and bedridden Ilyusha is thrilled to see Kolya, but all the boys around the bed are disappointed that he was unable to bring Zuchka.

Kolya did find Zuchka, and then gave the dog a different name so that no one would spoil his surprise for Ilyusha. Katerina, still guilty over Dmitri's beating of Ilyusha's father, has summoned a doctor from Moscow to look after the boy, and when he arrives, Ilyusha's guests are forced to leave", "analysis": ""}
