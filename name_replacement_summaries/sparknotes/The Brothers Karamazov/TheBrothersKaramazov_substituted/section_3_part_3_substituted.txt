In Verse Alyosha leaves the monastery, as he has been ordered to do by both Zosima and his father. A wealthy gentlewoman friend of the Karamazovs, Madame Khokhlakov, has given Alyosha a note from Katerina, Austine's abandoned fiancee, asking him to visit her. Somewhat nervous about the prospect, Alyosha sets off for Katerina's house before returning to his father's. Alyosha assumes that he will not see Ivan or Austine at Katerina's house, though he thinks he would like to talk to Austine before he sees Katerina. Taking a shortcut to Katerina's house, he is surprised by Austine, who intercepts him on the path", "analysis": ""}
