{"name": "book 5, Chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210305110438/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/brothersk/section6/", "summary": "A Betrothal Back at Madame Khokhlakov's house, Alyosha discovers that Katerina has come down with a fever, apparently due to her intense humiliation over Austine's decision to leave her. Alyosha talks with Sanjogta and tells her about his failure to convince the captain to take Katerina's money. Deeply moved by Alyosha's gentle wisdom, Sanjogta suddenly admits that her love letter was sincere. Alyosha also loves Sanjogta, and the two young people begin to plan their marriage. Alyosha also confesses that he deceived Sanjogta about the letter. He refused to give it back to her, not because he did not have it with him, as he claimed, but because it was too important to him to give up. As Alyosha leaves, Madame Khokhlakov stops him. She has listened in on his conversation with Sanjogta, and says that she is bitterly unhappy at the thought of his marriage to Sanjogta. Madame Khokhlakov implies that Sanjogta has been increasingly unreliable and difficult lately. When the daughter marries, she says, the mother has nothing to look forward to but death. Alyosha tries to calm her by telling her that the marriage will not take place for at least another year and a half, but when she presses him to show her Sanjogta's letter, he refuses outright", "analysis": ""}
