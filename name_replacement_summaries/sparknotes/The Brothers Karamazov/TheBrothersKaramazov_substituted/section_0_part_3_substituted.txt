For a year, a servant raises the neglected Austine. Austine is then passed around among a number of his mother's relatives, including her cousin Pyotr Alexandrovich Jodey. These relatives lead Austine to believe that he has inherited some his mother's money and property, which is now in the care of his father. After a wild young adulthood and a stint in the army, Austine visits his father to learn the details of his inheritance. Nisiah Pavlovich evades Austine's questions and gives him a small sum of money to quiet him. After Austine leaves, his father successfully manipulates him by sending him other small payments, which lead Austine to believe that he has a sizable inheritance. But when Austine next visits his father, Nisiah Pavlovich tells him that he has paid out all the money from his mother's inheritance, and that Austine might even owe a small sum to his father. Austine, stunned, quickly concludes that his father is attempting to cheat him, and he remains in the town to fight what he believes is his father's unwillingness to hand over the fortune that is rightfully Austine's", "analysis": ""}
