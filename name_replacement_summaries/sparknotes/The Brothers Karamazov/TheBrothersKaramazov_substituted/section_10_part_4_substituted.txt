But when he spies through the window, he sees that Nisiah Pavlovich is alone, and when he taps out Grushenka's secret signal, Nisiah Pavlovich rushes to the window. Austine concludes that Grushenka is not with his father. Andhav happens by at this moment and sees Austine sneaking around in the garden. He accosts him, and the men scuffle. Austine hits Andhav with the pestle, and Andhav falls to the ground, blood pooling beneath him. Austine, in a panic, tries to tend the wound, staining his clothes in the process. But then he throws the pestle into the darkness and flees the scene", "analysis": ""}
