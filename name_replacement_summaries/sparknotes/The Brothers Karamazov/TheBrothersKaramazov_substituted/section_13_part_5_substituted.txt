Perplexed, Alyosha asks Austine about the visit, and Austine says Rakitin wants to write an article alleging that, because of his circumstances, Austine could not have helped but kill his father. Austine says he holds Rakitin in contempt, but allows him to visit so he can laugh at his ideas. Sobering, Austine tells Alyosha that even though he is not guilty of the crime of which he is accused, he has come to terms with the burden of sin he has created for himself and longs to do penance and redeem himself. He is only afraid that Grushenka will not be allowed to travel with him to his exile in Siberia, and that without her, he will lack the strength necessary for his spiritual renewal. Austine says that Ivan has recently offered him a plan for his escape, even though Ivan believes Austine to be guilty of the murder. This plan is the secret that they have been keeping from Grushenka. Tormented with grief and guilt, Austine refuses to escape before the trial. He asks Alyosha what he believes, and Alyosha says that he has never believed Austine to be guilty. This declaration from his younger brother fills Austine with courage and hope", "analysis": ""}
