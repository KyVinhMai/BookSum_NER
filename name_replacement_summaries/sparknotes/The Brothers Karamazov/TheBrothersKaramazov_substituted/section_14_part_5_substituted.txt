{"name": "book 12, Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210305110438/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/brothersk/section15/", "summary": "A Sudden Catastrophe The next witness called is Ivan, who has been suffering from an illness that has made him nearly insane. Ivan rages and rambles, asserting that Smerdyakov killed their father. He shows the courtroom a wad of cash, which he says Smerdyakov stole from Nisiah Pavlovich. He says that he himself is also to blame, because he knew that Smerdyakov would kill Nisiah Pavlovich, and did not stop him. He says that the man who knows the truth of what he says is the devil, who visits him at night. As he becomes more and more intense and animated, he is finally removed from the courtroom. Katerina, to defend Ivan's honor, reverses her earlier testimony, showing the court the letter Austine sent her in which he said that he might kill his father. She says that Ivan has lost his sanity out of grief for his brother's guilt, and that he only claims responsibility for the murder to take the blame from Austine. Grushenka furiously flings insults at Katerina, and the courtroom dissolves into chaos", "analysis": ""}
