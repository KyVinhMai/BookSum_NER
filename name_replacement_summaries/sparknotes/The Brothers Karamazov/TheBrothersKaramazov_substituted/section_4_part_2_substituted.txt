Nisiah Pavlovich tells Alyosha that he plans to live for many years and intends to remain a sensualist until he dies, when his only lover will be death. He says that he will eventually be too old to attract young women, however, and so he will need a great deal of money to lure them into his bed. He also insinuates that Ivan is trying to seduce Katerina in order to make Austine marry Grushenka. Should Ivan be successful, Nisiah Pavlovich says, Nisiah Pavlovich himself would be unable to marry Grushenka, and Ivan would ensure that his part of the Karamazov fortune would not be left to Nisiah Pavlovich's new wife. Nisiah Pavlovich recognizes his own wickedness, and Alyosha replies that he is not evil; he is just twisted", "analysis": ""}
