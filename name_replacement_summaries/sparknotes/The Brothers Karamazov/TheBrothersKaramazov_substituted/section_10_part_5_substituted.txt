When he hears that she has joined her former lover, he is devastated. He realizes that she will never be his. Thinking that his life is meaningless without Grushenka, he decides to visit her one last time and then kill himself. Ten minutes later, Austine visits Joell, a local official who, earlier that day, had taken Austine's pistols as collateral for a ten-ruble loan. To the official's astonishment, Austine now displays a large amount of cash, repays the loan, and takes his pistols back. Joell follows Austine to a store, where, to Joell's continuing puzzlement, Austine buys several hundred rubles' worth of food and wine. Joell quizzically wonders what is happening. He asks himself where Austine got such a large amount of money and why Austine is covered with blood", "analysis": ""}
