Alyosha notes that Austine seems to be avoiding him, so Alyosha decides to stake out the gazebo that he knows Austine often visits to watch for Grushenka. There, Alyosha overhears Smerdyakov playing a guitar and singing a song for the housekeeper's daughter. Alyosha tentatively interrupts this scene and asks Smerdyakov if he knows where Austine has gone. Smerdyakov says that Austine has gone to meet Ivan at a restaurant", "analysis": ""}
