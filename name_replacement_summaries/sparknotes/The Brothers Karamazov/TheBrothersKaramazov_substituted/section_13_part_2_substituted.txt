Alyosha and Grushenka have grown closer since Austine's arrest, and are now close friends. Grushenka fell ill three days after the arrest, but is now almost fully recovered. As her friendship with Alyosha has deepened, Grushenka has begun to show signs of spiritual redemption as well. Her fiery temper and her pride are still intact, but her eyes now shine with a new light of gentleness. She tells Alyosha that she and Austine have had an argument, and that she fears that Austine is in love with Katerina again, even though Katerina has not once visited him in prison. Grushenka also believes that Austine and Ivan are hiding something from her. She asks Alyosha to find out what it is, and Alyosha agrees to do so", "analysis": ""}
