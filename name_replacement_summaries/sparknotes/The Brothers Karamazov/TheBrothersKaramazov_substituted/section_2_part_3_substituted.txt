When Alyosha catches up, Zosima tells him that he wants Alyosha to leave the monastery, rejoin the world, and even find a wife. Alyosha is upset, but Zosima, smiling, tells Alyosha that his path lies outside the monastery. Zosima says that he has great faith in Alyosha, and then sends him away. Alyosha walks with Rakitin to meet the Father Superior, and they discuss the meaning of Zosima's strange departure. Rakitin says that the Karamazov dynasty is coming to a violent end, for the Karamazovs are all \"sensualists\" who only love women and money. He says that Austine has indeed abandoned his fiancee for Grushenka, and that Ivan is now trying to steal Austine's cast-off fiancee, with Austine's consent, while Nisiah Pavlovich chases after Austine's mistress. Rakitin says that Zosima understands that this drama can only end in bloodshed, and that he bowed to Austine so that, after the tragedy occurs, people will think Zosima had foreseen it. Rakitin goes on insulting the Karamazovs and Grushenka, even saying that Grushenka wishes to seduce Alyosha, until Alyosha asks whether Grushenka is not one of Rakitin's relatives. Rakitin, angry and embarrassed, denies this claim", "analysis": ""}
