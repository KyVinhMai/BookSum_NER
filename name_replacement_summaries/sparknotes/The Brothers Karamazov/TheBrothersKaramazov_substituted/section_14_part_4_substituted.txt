Alyosha also admits that he believes Smerdyakov may be the real murderer. Katerina tells the story of Austine saving her father from prison. The crowd, which was impressed with Alyosha's testimony, is slightly disgusted with Katerina because she has so thoroughly debased herself before Austine, who does not love her. Grushenka is questioned and vehemently insists on Austine's innocence", "analysis": ""}
