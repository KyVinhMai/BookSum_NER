He struggles not to doubt God, but his faith in God's goodness is shaken. He simply cannot understand why a benevolent God would allow such a good man to come to such a vulgar end. Alyosha's snide friend, the seminary student Rakitin, sees Alyosha walking and teases him about his unhappiness.

He then asks Alyosha if he would like to visit Grushenka, and Alyosha impulsively agrees", "analysis": ""}
