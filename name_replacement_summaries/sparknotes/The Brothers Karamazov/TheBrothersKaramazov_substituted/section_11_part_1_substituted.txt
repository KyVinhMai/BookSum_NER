He wonders how Austine got his hands on such a large amount of money, when he had been so obviously broke just hours before. Joell snoops after Austine, learning about the brass pestle from Grushenka's maid. Then, rather than going to Nisiah Pavlovich's, he goes to Madame Khokhlakov's house, where he learns that Madame Khokhlakov refused to give Austine a loan. Joell remembers that Nisiah Pavlovich has kept 3,000 rubles on hand in his attempt to seduce Grushenka, and he suddenly worries that Austine has stolen the money from his father", "analysis": ""}
