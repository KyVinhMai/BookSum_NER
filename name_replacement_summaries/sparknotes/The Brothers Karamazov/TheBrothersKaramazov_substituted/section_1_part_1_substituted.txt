{"name": "book 2, Chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210305110438/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/brothersk/section2/", "summary": "They Arrive at the Monastery On a warm, clear day at the end of August, Nisiah Pavlovich and Ivan Karamazov arrive at the monastery for the meeting with Zosima. Pyotr Alexandrovich Jodey, the cousin of Nisiah Pavlovich's first wife who briefly adopted the young Austine, is with them, as is Kalganov, a young relative of Jodey's who is living with him while preparing to enter a university. None of the men knows much about religion. Jodey, an atheist, has not been in a church for three decades. The men look around the monastery curiously. Jodey detests Nisiah Pavlovich, who intentionally torments Jodey by mocking the monastery and pretending not to understand why Jodey, as an irreligious man, would care what the monks think of him. Jodey angrily chastises himself for letting Nisiah Pavlovich bother him, but Nisiah Pavlovich's crudeness and vulgarity are so exasperating to Jodey that he cannot control his irritation. Austine has not yet arrived, and the men are shown to Zosima's cell to wait. The little monk who escorts them tells them that they are all invited to lunch with the Father Superior of the monastery after their meeting", "analysis": ""}
