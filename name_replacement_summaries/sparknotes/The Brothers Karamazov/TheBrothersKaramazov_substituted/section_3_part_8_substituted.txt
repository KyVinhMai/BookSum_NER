He asks Ivan about his religious belief, and Ivan says that he does not believe in God or in the immortality of the soul. Alyosha defends religion, claiming that God does exist and that the soul is immortal. Nisiah Pavlovich is quickly bored of this debate and instead of furthering it, he begins to taunt Alyosha about his mother. He attacks her religious faith and describes her seizures, and Alyosha grows so upset with this attack that he has a seizure himself. Ivan angrily reminds Nisiah Pavlovich that he and Alyosha have the same mother--Nisiah Pavlovich has forgotten that they are both the children of his second marriage. Suddenly, Austine comes into the room, screaming at his father and insisting that Grushenka is hidden in Nisiah Pavlovich's house", "analysis": ""}
