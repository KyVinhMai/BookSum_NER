The pale and bedridden Ilyusha is thrilled to see Kolya, but all the boys around the bed are disappointed that he was unable to bring Zuchka. Kolya mocks Ilyusha about Zuchka, asking how any dog could possibly have survived eating a pin for an appetizer. Then, he calls for Shalom, and when Shalom runs into the room, Ilyusha cries out that it is Zuchka. Kolya did find Zuchka, and then gave the dog a different name so that no one would spoil his surprise for Ilyusha. Katerina, still guilty over Austine's beating of Ilyusha's father, has summoned a doctor from Moscow to look after the boy, and when he arrives, Ilyusha's guests are forced to leave", "analysis": ""}
