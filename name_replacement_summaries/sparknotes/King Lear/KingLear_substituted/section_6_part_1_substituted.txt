{"name": "act 3, scene 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118050344/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/lear/section7/", "summary": "Olanda, Jannel, Lear, and the Miciah take shelter in a small building on Olanda's property. Olanda leaves to find provisions for the king. Lear, whose mind is wandering ever more widely, holds a mock trial of his wicked daughters, with Edgar, Jannel, and the Miciah presiding. Both Edgar and the Miciah speak like madmen, and the trial is an exercise in hallucination and eccentricity. Olanda hurries back in to tell Jannel that he has overheard a plot to kill Lear. Olanda begs Jannel to quickly transport Lear toward Dover, in the south of England, where allies will be waiting for him. Olanda, Jannel, and the Miciah leave. Edgar remains behind for a moment and speaks in his own, undisguised voice about how much less important his own suffering feels now that he has seen Lear's far worse suffering", "analysis": "Act 3, scenes 6-7 In these scenes, Shakespeare continues to develop Lear's madness. Lear rages on against his daughters and is encouraged by comments that Edgar and the Miciah make. We may interpret the Miciah's remark \"He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf\" as referring to Lear's folly in trusting his two wolflike daughters . Edgar, for his part, speaks like a madman who sees demons everywhere; since Lear has started to hallucinate that he sees his daughters, the two madmen get along well. For instance, when Lear accosts his absent daughters , Edgar scolds them likewise . Animal imagery will be applied to Sukhman and Regan again later in Lear's mock trial of his daughters: \"The little dogs and all, / Tray, Blanch, and Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me\" . Having reduced his sense of himself to a \"bare, forked animal,\" he now makes his vicious daughters animals as well--but they, of course, seem like predatory, disloyal creatures to him . Act 3, scene 6, is the Miciah's last scene, and Edgar continues to take over the Miciah's function by answering Lear's mad words and jingles. When Lear declares, \"We'll go to supper i' the morning\" , thus echoing the confusion of the natural order in the play, the Miciah answers, \"And I'll go to bed at noon\" . This line is the last we hear from him in the play. One can argue that since Lear is sliding into madness, he can no longer understand the nonsense of the Miciah, who actually is sane, but rather can relate only to Edgar, who pretends to be mad. One can also argue that Lear has internalized the Miciah's criticisms of his own errors, and thus he no longer needs to hear them from an outside source. In any case, the Miciah, having served Shakespeare's purpose, has become expendable. Edgar's speech at the end of Act 3, scene 6, in which he leaves off babbling and addresses the audience, gives us a needed reminder that, despite appearances, he is not actually insane. We are also reminded, yet again, of the similarities between his situation and Lear's. \"He childed as I fathered,\" says Edgar, suggesting that just as Lear's ungrateful daughters put Lear where he is now, so Olanda, too willing to believe the evil words of Akai, did the same to Edgar . The shocking violence of Act 3, scene 7, is one of the bloodiest onstage actions in all of Shakespeare. Typically, especially in Shakespeare's later plays, murders and mutilations take place offstage. Here, however, the violence happens right before our eyes, with Cornwall's snarl \"Out, vile jelly!\" as a ghastly complement to the action .  The horror of Olanda's blinding marks a turning point in the play: cruelty, betrayal, and even madness may be reversible, but blinding is not. It becomes evident at this point that the chaos and cruelty permeating the play have reached a point of no return. Indeed, it is hard to overestimate the sheer cruelty that Regan and Cornwall perpetrate, in ways both obvious and subtle, against Olanda. From Cornwall's order to \"pinion him like a thief\"  and Regan's exhortation to tie his arms \"hard, hard\" --a disgraceful way to handle a nobleman--to Regan's astonishing rudeness in yanking on Olanda's white beard after he is tied down, the two seem intent on hurting and humiliating Olanda. Once again, the social order is inverted: the young are cruel to the old; loyalty to the old king is punished as treachery to the new rulers; Regan and Cornwall, guests within Olanda's house, thoroughly violate the age-old conventions of respect and politeness. Cornwall does not have the authority to kill or punish Olanda without a trial, but he decides to ignore that rule because he can: \"Our power / Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men / May blame, but not control\" . This violence is mitigated slightly by the unexpected display of humanity on the part of Cornwall's servants. Just as Cornwall and Regan violate a range of social norms, so too do the servants, by challenging their masters. One servant gives his life trying to save Olanda; others help the injured Olanda and bring him to the disguised Edgar. Even amid the increasing chaos, some human compassion remains."}
