He announces that he and David will begin their search in London the next day. Mrs. Gummidge comforts Mr. Peggotty, who asks her to stay behind and wait for Little Em'ly's return. When David returns to the inn, Miss Mowcher visits him and relates her part in the disaster that has struck the Peggotty family. Standing on the stove, she tells David that when she ran into him and Steerforth in Yarmouth, she believed that David, not Steerforth, was in love with Little Em'ly. Miss Mowcher agreed to give Little Em'ly a letter, which she assumed David had written. The letter put the whole affair into motion. Miss Mowcher apologizes for causing such a nightmare and cautions David not to judge her based on her size. She reminds him that it is not her fault that she was born a dwarf and that she must be sarcastic to get by in the high society she keeps. David agrees, and when Miss Mowcher leaves, he reflects that he has a very different opinion of her than before. Mr. Peggotty and David arrive in London the next day. They visit Mrs. Steerforth, who blames Little Em'ly for her son's downfall and Mr. Peggotty for having raised such a wretch. Mrs. Steerforth swears that her son will never marry Little Em'ly. As they leave, Miss Dartle angrily hisses at David for introducing Steerforth to Little Em'ly and for bringing Mr. Peggotty to the Steerforth house. Mr. Peggotty departs to search for Little Em'ly", "analysis": ""}
