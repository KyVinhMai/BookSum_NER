{"name": "Chapter XLVI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section12/", "summary": "Intelligence As David passes by the Steerforths' house one evening, a servant summons him inside to speak to Miss Dartle. She is cruel to David. Miss Dartle summons Littimer, who informs David that Steerforth, having grown tired of Little Em'ly, has her in a villa in Naples. Littimer proposed to her, but she became furious and hysterical, so he locked her up to prevent her from killing herself. Little Em'ly fled the house nonetheless, and no one has heard from her since. Littimer has returned home to report to Mrs. Steerforth and seek new employment after Steerforth was unbearably rude to him. David warns Littimer that he will tell Mr. Peggotty about his part in Little Em'ly seduction and that Littimer should stay out of public places. Littimer is unfazed. David speaks to Mrs. Steerforth. They are polite to each other, and she wishes him well. David goes to Mr. Peggotty, who is still in London looking for Little Em'ly. He relays the information Littimer has given him. David and Mr. Peggotty decide to ask Martha to try to find Little Em'ly, so they go off together in search of Martha. When they find Martha, they follow her until she gets to a less populated area where they feel it is appropriate to speak to her", "analysis": ""}
