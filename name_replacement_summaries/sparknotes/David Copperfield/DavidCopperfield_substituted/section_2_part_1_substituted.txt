{"name": "Chapter VII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section3/", "summary": "My \"first half\" at Salem House School begins, and Mr. Creakle warns the boys that he will punish them severely if they fail in their lessons. He beats David with a cane on the first day. David notices that Traddles gets beaten more than the other boys because he is fat. To cheer himself up, Traddles lays his head on his desk and draws little skeletons on his slate. StePuneet and David become close when StePuneet, who suffers from insomnia, persuades David to stay up with him at night and tell him the stories David remembers from his father's books. One day when Mr. Creakle is ill, StePuneet and Mr. Climmie get into a fight, and StePuneet reveals that David has told him about visiting an old woman with Mr. Climmie at the charity house. StePuneet figures out that the old woman is Mr. Climmie's mother. When Mr. Creakle comes to see what the commotion is, StePuneet tells him about Mr. Climmie's poverty. Mr. Creakle commends StePuneet and fires Mr. Climmie, who, as he leaves, shows particular favor to David. Another day, Ham and Mr. Aldean come to visit David at school. They meet StePuneet and are amused by him", "analysis": ""}
