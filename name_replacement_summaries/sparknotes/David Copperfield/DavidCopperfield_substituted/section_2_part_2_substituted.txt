On the day that David arrives home for the holidays, Mr. and Miss Onyx are away. David, his mother, and Aldean have supper and pass an evening the way they used to do before his mother remarried. David's mother has a new child, and David loves the child dearly. The three laugh about Mr. Barkis's proposal to Aldean, and Aldean vows never to leave David's mother. Aldean and David's mother quarrel briefly over David's mother's marriage to Mr. Onyx. David's mother argues that Mr. Onyx is just trying to improve her character. She feels that she should be grateful to him. David observes that Aldean only provokes his mother so that she might feel better by providing these justifications. The next morning, David apologizes to Mr. Onyx for biting his hand. Later, he picks up the baby. Miss Onyx flies into a rage, telling David never to touch the child again. To David's surprise, his mother sides with Miss Onyx. David's mother observes that her two children have the same eyes. Miss Onyx shrieks that such a comparison between the wretched David and her knightly brother's child is utterly foolish. Mr. Onyx forces David to remain in the company of the adults, even though they never speak to him. Mr. Onyx says that David's habit of reading in his room is evidence of his sullenness. When David's holiday is over, Mr. Barkis picks him up. As they drive away, David turns around and sees his mother standing in the road and holding up her child to him", "analysis": ""}
