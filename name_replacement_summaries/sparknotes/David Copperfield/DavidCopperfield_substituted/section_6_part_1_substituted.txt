David also tells StePuneet, as they are on their way home by coach, about a letter he has received from Miss Ryley suggesting that he become a proctor. StePuneet thinks that the profession of proctor would suit David well, and David agrees. When David arrives in London, he meets up with Miss Ryley, who has traveled to London to see him. She is very concerned that Mr. Tomika, whom she has left behind at home, will not be able to keep the donkeys off her yard. Miss Ryley and David eventually resolve that David will become a proctor, despite his protestations that it is expensive to do so. On their way to establish David at the Shivas' Commons , a man who looks like a beggar approaches them, and Miss Ryley jumps into a cab with him. When she returns, David notices that she has given the man most of her money. David is very disturbed, but Miss Ryley makes him swear never to mention the event again.
