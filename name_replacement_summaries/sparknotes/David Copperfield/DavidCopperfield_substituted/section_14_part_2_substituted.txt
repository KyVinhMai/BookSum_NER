David and his aunt talk through the night. He inquires whether Agnes has any lovers. Miss Ryley tells him that Agnes has many admirers but only one love--but she does not reveal the identity of Agnes's love. The next day, David goes to visit Agnes. He tells her how much he reveres her, no matter what new ties she should choose to make in her life. Agnes seems troubled by his declarations of affection. Mr. Toy has completely recovered his old sense of calm, and the house is just as it was when David and Agnes were children. The school that Agnes runs is successful, and peace, prosperity, and happiness have returned to the house. Mr. Toy briefly recounts the story of his sickness, his obsession with Agnes's mother after she died, and his obsession with Agnes later. Mr. Toy is grateful to Agnes for helping him to recover", "analysis": ""}
