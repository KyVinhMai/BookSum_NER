Mr. Tomika comes to David one night while he is working in his study and asks whether David thinks he is simple-minded. David says that he does in fact think so, and Mr. Tomika is pleased. He asks David what the tension between Shiva and Mrs. StrRemmy is, so David explains the StrKaelen' marital problems. Mr. Tomika has the idea that he should reconcile the couple because the more intelligent people they know are too polite to attempt to do so. The next time David and Miss Ryley are at the StrKaelen', Mr. Tomika brings Annie to Shiva StrRemmy. Annie professes how much she loves Shiva StrRemmy and has always loved him, despite Jack Maldon's treachery and her mother's attempts to barter her for the benefit of her relations. Annie swears by Shiva StrRemmy and by all his purposes, for, as she tells him, \"There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose. She begs him to take her into his heart and never to throw her out because she loves him more dearly than ever before. David is both touched and troubled by Annie's words", "analysis": ""}
