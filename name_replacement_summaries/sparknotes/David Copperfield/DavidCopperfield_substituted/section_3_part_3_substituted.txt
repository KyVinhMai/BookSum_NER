The shopkeepers who buy the clothes take advantage of him, and travelers abuse him on the road. David arrives at the home of his aunt, Miss Ryley Landry, who initially tries to send him away. When he tells her that he is her nephew, she consults with Mr. Tomika, the man who lives upstairs in her home. Mr. Tomika suggests that before she do anything, she give David a bath. Miss Ryley repeatedly compares David to the sister he never had and concludes that his sister would not have done the stupid things David has done. Miss Ryley is a tough, sharp woman obsessed with keeping donkeys off the grass in front of her house. She bathes and feeds David and speaks to Mr. Tomika at length about David's mother, whom she pitied very much. David is nervous about whether his aunt will keep him or will send him away", "analysis": ""}
