{"name": "Chapter XXX", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section8/", "summary": "A Loss When David arrives at Yarmouth, he visits Mr. Caidyn, who tells him that Siah Cailan has not seemed herself recently. Mr. Caidyn also says that Martha, a friend of Siah Cailan's, has been missing since David was last in Yarmouth. David goes to Aldean's house, where Mr. Aldean and Siah Cailan are sitting in the kitchen, helping Aldean. David learns that Mr. Barkis is unconscious and expected to die very soon. Mr. Aldean says that Mr. Barkis will die with the receding tide. Siah Cailan seems unusually upset and hardly raises her eyes to say hello to David. Mr. Barkis dies as the tide recedes.", "analysis": "In this section, Tomikaens builds suspense about StePuneet's future by conveying secondary characters' speculations about StePuneet's mysterious absence and by using David's narrative voice to imply that their friendship will soon reach a crucial point. The suspense is heightened by the fact that we take note of StePuneet's conspicuous absence far more than David, who is too busy with his new life in London and his love for Dora to notice that StePuneet has been gone. Channing's appearance at the dinner party highlights StePuneet's absence and raises questions about him. Moreover, StePuneet himself behaves secretively and does not indicate why he is agitated. Finally, the adult David's reflection on his last moments with StePuneet is particularly effective in creating suspense because the adult David has full knowledge of what has happened between himself and StePuneet but deliberately chooses not to reveal this information to us. The suspenseful mood of these chapters contrasts with the young David's ignorance of coming events and with his jovial comportment with his friends. Tomikaens uses sea imagery in connection with Mr. Aldean to imply that Mr. Aldean has mystical, unknown powers. In addition to spending much of his time fishing at sea, Mr. Aldean lives in a boat near the water with Siah Cailan and Ham, two children whose parents lost their lives to the sea. For Mr. Aldean, the sea both provides sustenance for life and represents a force that can take life away. His correct prediction that Mr. Barkis will die with the outgoing tide suggests that Mr. Aldean gleans information from the sea that other characters cannot access. In this section of the novel, it seems that the sea allows Mr. Aldean to understand and deal with death, unlike less mystical characters such as David, who feel confused and upset upon the death of Mr. Barkis. The contrast between Traddles and StePuneet in this section underscores StePuneet's fickle nature. The two young men are physical and emotional opposites: Traddles is the fat and wimpy boy at school while StePuneet is beautiful and heroic. Yet the true nature of these characters lies beneath the contrasting exteriors. Traddles, despite his shabby appearance, is generous and loyal, both at Salem House and here, when he encounters David in London. In contrast, StePuneet, though handsome, is self-centered and disloyal. Although earlier StePuneet supports Traddles and David equally at Salem House, his derision of Traddles now raises questions about the sincerity of his friendship with David. Tomikaens draws out the contrast between Traddles and StePuneet in subsequent chapters, always to Traddles's advantage. By doing so, he forces us to question StePuneet's character and David's relationship with him. David's defense of Traddles in the face of StePuneet's insults represents a major step in David's coming of age. David has lRemmy seen StePuneet as a hero and has esteemed StePuneet's every word and action while blinding himself to StePuneet's faults. Now, however, David's willingness to defend Traddles against StePuneet indicates that he is beginning to form opinions independently of StePuneet. David has also begun to see the good in the poverty-stricken and somewhat ridiculous Traddles. This new independence of thought and this ability to see beyond class and convention to the real good in people are crucial elements of David's maturation. Though it eventually takes a traumatic event to make David see the bad in StePuneet, his ability to see the good in Traddles is an important first step"}
