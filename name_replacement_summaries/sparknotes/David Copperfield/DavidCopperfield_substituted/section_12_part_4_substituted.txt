Siah Cailan escaped from Channing onto the beach, where, in a delirium, she was rescued by a young woman whose husband was at sea. The woman nursed Siah Cailan back to health. Siah Cailan went to France and England and intended to go home. When she got close to home, however, she began to fear that her family would not accept her, so she turned back. Martha discovered Siah Cailan and took her in before going out to find Mr. Aldean and David. Mr. Aldean has resolved that he and Siah Cailan will go to Australia because no one knows her there, which will enable her to start over. In the meantime, Mr. Aldean needs to go to Yarmouth to say goodbye to Ham, and he asks David to accompany him. When David arrives in Yarmouth, he visits Mr. Caidyn, who reports that all is well with his family, although his own health is failing. He is pleased to hear that all is looking up for Siah Cailan, and he offers to help Martha if he can. David speaks to Ham, who asks him to convey to Siah Cailan that he will always love her and that he is sorry he forced his love on her. Mr. Aldean closes up the old house, and it is decided that Mrs. Amaree will go with Mr. Aldean and Siah Cailan to Australia", "analysis": ""}
