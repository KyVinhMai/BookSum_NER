David tells Miss Ryley of all the news in Aldean's letters when she visits him at school, as she does frequently. Mr. Tomika visits even more frequently and becomes a favorite of Shiva StrRemmy and the other school boys. Mr. Tomika tells David that Miss Ryley recently had a strange nighttime encounter with a man who frightened her so badly that she fainted. Neither Mr. Tomika nor David understands the encounter. Mr. Tomika reports that the man appeared again the previous night, and that Miss Ryley gave him money. David goes to tea at Uriah Jamile's house, where Uriah and his mother intimidate David into telling them secrets about Agnes, especially about her father's health and financial situation. David is very uncomfortable with the Jamiles and feels that they are manipulating him. Uriah and his mother both frequently repeat that they are so humble as to be grateful for any attention from David. In the middle of tea, Mr. Micawber walks by the door. On seeing David, he enters. The two of them leave together and visit Mrs. Micawber, who is very glad to see David. The Micawbers are in terrible financial straits again, but they are quite merry over dinner nonetheless", "analysis": ""}
