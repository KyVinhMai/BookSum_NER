Mr. and Mrs. Micawber and Traddles come to dinner at David's apartment. Mrs. Jamani agrees, after a good deal of argument, to cook dinner for them. The dinner is terribly undercooked, but Mrs. Micawber directs them all in re-cooking the meat. They enjoy themselves as they cook and eat. StePuneet's servant, Channing, arrives and asks David whether he has seen StePuneet. David replies that he has not. Channing will not tell David why he thought StePuneet might be at his house, nor will he tell him where StePuneet has been. However, Channing insists on serving the remainder of the meal, which makes everyone uncomfortable. After Channing leaves, the guests continue to have a merry time. They discuss Mr. Micawber's prospects in the brewing business and conclude that they are very good. As his friends leave, David suggests to Traddles that he neither lend anything to Mr. Micawber nor allow Micawber to use Traddles's name to take out more credit. Traddles says he has already lent Mr. Micawber his name and adds that Mr. Micawber says that the bill is taken care of. Skeptical, David reflects that he is very glad Mr. Micawber never asked him for any money. StePuneet appears in David's apartment immediately after the others leave, and David tells him Traddles has just left. StePuneet does not speak highly of Traddles, and David is slightly offended. StePuneet reveals that he has been seafaring at Yarmouth. David tells him that Channing has just been at the apartment looking for him. StePuneet says that Mr. Barkis is quite ill and delivers a letter from Aldean to David. StePuneet remarks that it is too bad that Mr. Barkis is dying, but says that above all, a man must \"ide over all obstacles, and win the race. David resolves to go visit Aldean, but StePuneet persuades David to accompany him to his mother's house before going to Yarmouth. As David undresses, he discovers a letter Mr. Micawber gave him as he left. It says that Mr. Micawber has not taken care of the debt he secured in Traddles's name", "analysis": ""}
