{"name": "Chapter XXXIII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section9/", "summary": "Blissful David thinks of Dora constantly while walking in her neighborhood but does not dare approach her house. He takes Aldean, who has come with him to London, to the Shivas' Commons to settle her affairs. While they wait, Mr. Onyx arrives at the Shivas' Commons to get his new marriage license. Aldean yells at him and blames him for the death of David's mother. Mr. Ayo invites David to his house for Dora's birthday. At the party, David makes a great show of not being jealous as another man pays attention to Dora. Dora's friend Julia Darnelle forces David and Dora to reconcile. The two fall in love. Miss Darnelle arranges for them to meet at her house when Dora visits her next. David and Dora become engaged. They continue to meet through Miss Darnelle but keep their betrothal a secret from everyone else. In retrospect, the adult David muses that he was happier then than he has ever been. Just the day before he wrote this section of the novel, David saw his daughter wearing a ring like the one he gave Dora--a sight that inspired a painful memory of Dora", "analysis": ""}
