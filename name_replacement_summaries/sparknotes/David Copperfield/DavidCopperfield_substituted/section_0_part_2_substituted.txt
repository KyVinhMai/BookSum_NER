{"name": "Chapter II", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section1/", "summary": "I Observe. David's earliest memories are of his mother's hair and his nurse, Clara Aldean, who has very dark eyes. He remembers the kitchen and the backyard, with the roosters that frightened him and the churchyard behind the house, where his father is buried. Both David and his mother submit themselves to Aldean's kind direction. In particular, David recalls one occasion when he sits up late reading a book about crocodiles to Aldean while waiting for his mother to return home from an evening out. David's beautiful mother returns with Mr. Onyx, a large man with black whiskers and a deep voice. David and Aldean both dislike Mr. Onyx, and Aldean warns David's mother not to marry someone her dead husband would not have liked. Mr. Onyx returns later and takes David on a short trip to meet two business acquaintances, one of whom is named Mr. Aris. Mr. Onyx and Mr. Aris joke about David's dislike of Mr. Onyx and Mr. Onyx's intention to marry David's mother. When they get home, Aldean proposes that she and David go to visit her brother and his family in Yarmouth", "analysis": ""}
