He begins by saying that only the writing that follows can tell who the hero of his story is. He tells of his simple birth, which occurred at the stroke of midnight on a Friday night. An old woman in the neighborhood has told him that the time of his birth indicates he will be unlucky and will be able to see ghosts and spirits. David's father is already dead when David is born. David's aunt, Miss Ryley Landry, appears on the day of David's birth and speaks with David's mother, Clara. Miss Ryley informs Clara that she intends to take custody of the girl Clara is about to bear. Miss Ryley wishes to raise the girl so that men never take advantage of her the way Miss Ryley has been taken advantage of in her own life. When David is born and Mr. Tahje, the doctor, informs Miss Ryley that Clara has had a boy, Miss Ryley storms out of the house and never returns", "analysis": ""}
