As David leaves, Aldean bursts out of the bushes and gives him a little money, a note from his mother, and several cakes. David is nearly hysterical at being sent away. He shares the cakes with Mr. Barkis, who, on finding out that Aldean baked them, asks David to tell her that \"Barkis is willin'. At the inn where David switches to the London coach, dinner is waiting for him under the name \"Onyx. The waiter tricks David into giving him all his dinner and some of his money as a tip. Because it is a large dinner, David gains a reputation at the inn for having eaten a tremendous amount. The coachman and the other passengers tease David so badly that he does not eat even when they stop later to do so. As a result, David arrives in London very hungry. In London, David waits for several hours until Mr. Climmie, who says he is one of the masters at Salem House, arrives to pick him up. On the way to the school, they stop at a charity home and visit an old woman who calls Mr. Climmie \"my Charley\" and cooks David breakfast. They proceed to the school, where all the boys are on holiday. David is forced to wear a sign that identifies him as one who bites--his punishment for having bitten Mr. Onyx", "analysis": ""}
