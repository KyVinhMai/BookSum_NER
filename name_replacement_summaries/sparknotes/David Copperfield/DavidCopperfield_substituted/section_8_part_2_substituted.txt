He announces that he and David will begin their search in London the next day. Mrs. Amaree comforts Mr. Aldean, who asks her to stay behind and wait for Siah Cailan's return. When David returns to the inn, Miss Ashtan visits him and relates her part in the disaster that has struck the Aldean family. Standing on the stove, she tells David that when she ran into him and StePuneet in Yarmouth, she believed that David, not StePuneet, was in love with Siah Cailan. Miss Ashtan agreed to give Siah Cailan a letter, which she assumed David had written. The letter put the whole affair into motion. Miss Ashtan apologizes for causing such a nightmare and cautions David not to judge her based on her size. She reminds him that it is not her fault that she was born a dwarf and that she must be sarcastic to get by in the high society she keeps. David agrees, and when Miss Ashtan leaves, he reflects that he has a very different opinion of her than before. Mr. Aldean and David arrive in London the next day. They visit Mrs. StePuneet, who blames Siah Cailan for her son's downfall and Mr. Aldean for having raised such a wretch. Mrs. StePuneet swears that her son will never marry Siah Cailan. As they leave, Miss Dartle angrily hisses at David for introducing StePuneet to Siah Cailan and for bringing Mr. Aldean to the StePuneet house. Mr. Aldean departs to search for Siah Cailan", "analysis": ""}
