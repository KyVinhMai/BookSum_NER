Miss Dartle asks David why he has been keeping StePuneet away from his mother. David assures her that he has not been with StePuneet in the past several weeks. Miss Dartle seems very disturbed at this news. At dinner, Miss Dartle says that if StePuneet and his mother were ever to quarrel, their fight would be especially bitter because neither of them would want to give in to the other. However, Mrs. StePuneet assures Miss Dartle that she and her son are too conscious of their duty to each other ever to quarrel. At the end of the day, StePuneet begs David to promise that if anything ever separates them, David will remember him at his best. David promises. As he leaves, he looks in on the Paxtyn StePuneet. In retrospect, the adult David muses that he wishes he could have kept StePuneet just as he was at that moment, so that none of what was to come ever would have happened", "analysis": ""}
