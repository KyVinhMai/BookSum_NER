{"name": "Chapter XLVI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section12/", "summary": "Intelligence As David passes by the StePuneets' house one evening, a servant summons him inside to speak to Miss Dartle. She is cruel to David. Miss Dartle summons Channing, who informs David that StePuneet, having grown tired of Siah Cailan, has her in a villa in Naples. Channing proposed to her, but she became furious and hysterical, so he locked her up to prevent her from killing herself. Siah Cailan fled the house nonetheless, and no one has heard from her since. Channing has returned home to report to Mrs. StePuneet and seek new employment after StePuneet was unbearably rude to him. David warns Channing that he will tell Mr. Aldean about his part in Siah Cailan seduction and that Channing should stay out of public places. Channing is unfazed. David speaks to Mrs. StePuneet. They are polite to each other, and she wishes him well. David goes to Mr. Aldean, who is still in London looking for Siah Cailan. He relays the information Channing has given him. David and Mr. Aldean decide to ask Martha to try to find Siah Cailan, so they go off together in search of Martha. When they find Martha, they follow her until she gets to a less populated area where they feel it is appropriate to speak to her", "analysis": ""}
