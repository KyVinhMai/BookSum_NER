Mr. Toy and Shiva StrRemmy discuss arrangements Mr. Toy is trying to make for Annie's cousin, Jack Maldon. Mr. Toy wants to know whether there is any particular reason that Shiva StrRemmy wants Jack Maldon's new job to be one that sends him out of the country. Shiva StrRemmy assures him there is not. David is behind in his studies but quickly catches up. He makes friends with the boys at the school. At home, David speaks with Agnes, whom he finds more and more charming in her devotion to her father. One evening, at dinner, Jack Maldon interrupts the family to say that he hopes he can go abroad as soon as possible. Mr. Toy treats him politely but distantly and assures him that there will be no delay in getting him sent abroad. After dinner, Mr. Toy drinks heavily, and Agnes and David chat with him and play dominos. Mr. Toy offers to let David stay permanently at the house, and David gladly accepts. On his way to bed, David runs into Uriah Jamile. Uriah asks him whether he is impressed with Agnes. David notes that whenever he says something that pleases Uriah, Uriah writhes like a snake. David quickly rises to the top of his class and settles in happily. One evening, he, Mr. Toy, and Agnes visit Shiva StrRemmy's home for a farewell party for Jack Maldon. Annie's mother is there, and she encourages Shiva StrRemmy to continue to bestow favors on her family members, who are poor and lower-class. Shiva StrRemmy acquiesces to all her demands. When Jack Maldon leaves to depart for India, Annie becomes very emotional. As the coach pulls away, David sees one of her ribbons in Jack Maldon's hand", "analysis": ""}
