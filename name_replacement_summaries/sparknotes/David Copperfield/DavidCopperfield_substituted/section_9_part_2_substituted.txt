He determines that he will work through every difficulty to be with her and will raise himself and his aunt out of their present distress. Shiva StrRemmy agrees that David should be his secretary and that the two of them will work together on the dictionary Shiva StrRemmy is compiling. They begin immediately. While they are at breakfast, Jack Maldon asks Annie to go to the opera with him that night. Annie does not want to go, but Shiva StrRemmy tries to force her. David is suspicious of Jack Maldon's intentions and of Annie's fidelity to Shiva StrRemmy. Later, however, he hears that Annie has managed to cancel the date and go see Agnes instead. David takes Mr. Tomika, who is upset about Miss Ryley's financial situation, to see Traddles with him. Together, they decide that Mr. Tomika can work at copying legal manuscripts--a task that he must try to accomplish without inserting references to King Charles I. Mr. Tomika succeeds in doing so and thus earns some money for the family. David receives a letter from Mr. Micawber stating that Mr. Micawber intends to move and asking David to come say farewell. David and Traddles go and have dinner with the Micawbers and discover that Mr. Micawber has plans to go to Canterbury to work for Uriah Jamile. David is very uncomfortable at this arrangement but does not learn the details of it", "analysis": ""}
