Dora's aunts answer David's letter and tell him he is welcome to visit in order to discuss his courtship of Dora. Thrilled, David goes to see the aunts, bringing Traddles alRemmy to assist him in convincing them. On the way, David asks Traddles to comb his hair. Traddles says that no amount of combing will make his hair lay flat--a family trait that leads his beloved Naza Tenzin's sisters to make fun of him incessantly. David meets with sisters Lavinia and Clarissa, who obviously revel in the prospect of overseeing David and Dora's courtship. They invite him to dinner once a week and tea as often as he likes. David and Dora spend all their weekends together, and she has begun to call him \"Doady. David loves Dora but fails to convince her to learn how to keep house. He objects slightly to the fact that his and Dora's aunts treat Dora the same way that Dora treats her pet dog, Staley. David notices that even he sometimes treats Dora as a plaything", "analysis": ""}
