Mrs. Micawber is very concerned that Mr. Micawber should repair her relationship with her family before they leave. Agnes, Traddles, David, and Miss Ryley meet to discuss the Micawbers' finances. Traddles has discovered that he can recover all of Miss Ryley's money as well as Mr. Toy's. Agnes says she will rent out the house and run a school in order to keep herself and her father financially secure. David, meanwhile, decides he will go abroad. Traddles reports that Uriah has left town with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him. Arrangements are made to provide for the Micawbers' debts and raise enough money to get them to Australia. Two days later, Miss Ryley takes David to a hospital and to a funeral. She tells him that her husband has died, and that he will not be a threat to her anymore", "analysis": ""}
