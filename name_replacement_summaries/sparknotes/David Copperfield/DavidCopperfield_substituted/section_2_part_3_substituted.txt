The school sends David home, and Mr. Caidyn, a funeral director and general services provider, picks him up at the coach. Mr. Caidyn takes David to his shop, where he meets Mr. Caidyn's daughter, Filamena, and her sweetheart, Mr. Joram. Mr. Joram builds David's mother's coffin behind the shop, and David sits through the day listening to the sounds of the hammer. Mr. Caidyn tells David that David's little brother died a few days after his mother. The Caidyn family is quite jovial, but David sits in the shop with his head down. When David arrives home, Aldean greets him and comforts him. Miss Onyx only asks him if he has remembered his clothes. In retrospect, David admits that he cannot recall the order of all the events around this time, but he describes going to his mother's funeral with the few people who attend. Afterward, Aldean comes to him and tells him about his mother's last moments. She says that his mother died with her head on Aldean's arm", "analysis": ""}
