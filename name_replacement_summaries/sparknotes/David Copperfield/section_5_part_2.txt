Steerforth persuades David to stay a few days with him at his mother's house before going to Yarmouth. Steerforth nicknames David \"Daisy,\" and the two of them spend the day sightseeing before going to Steerforth's home. There, David meets Mrs. Steerforth, Steerforth's widowed mother, and Rosa Dartle, Steerforth's orphaned distant cousin whom Mrs. Steerforth took in when Miss Dartle's mother died. Mrs. Steerforth is an imposing, older, more feminine version of Steerforth, and she dotes on her son ceaselessly. Miss Dartle has a scar above her lip from a time when Steerforth, as a child, threw a hammer at her in anger. Miss Dartle views Steerforth's and David's words and actions with sarcasm, but both young men are drawn to her", "analysis": ""}
