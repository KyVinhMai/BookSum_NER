He takes Peggotty, who has come with him to London, to the Doctors' Commons to settle her affairs. While they wait, Mr. Murdstone arrives at the Doctors' Commons to get his new marriage license. Peggotty yells at him and blames him for the death of David's mother. Mr. Spenlow invites David to his house for Dora's birthday. At the party, David makes a great show of not being jealous as another man pays attention to Dora. Dora's friend Julia Mills forces David and Dora to reconcile. The two fall in love. Miss Mills arranges for them to meet at her house when Dora visits her next. David and Dora become engaged. They continue to meet through Miss Mills but keep their betrothal a secret from everyone else. In retrospect, the adult David muses that he was happier then than he has ever been. Just the day before he wrote this section of the novel, David saw his daughter wearing a ring like the one he gave Dora--a sight that inspired a painful memory of Dora", "analysis": ""}
