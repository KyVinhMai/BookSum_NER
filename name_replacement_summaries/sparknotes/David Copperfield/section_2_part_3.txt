The school sends David home, and Mr. Omer, a funeral director and general services provider, picks him up at the coach. Mr. Omer takes David to his shop, where he meets Mr. Omer's daughter, Minnie, and her sweetheart, Mr. Joram. Mr. Joram builds David's mother's coffin behind the shop, and David sits through the day listening to the sounds of the hammer. Mr. Omer tells David that David's little brother died a few days after his mother. The Omer family is quite jovial, but David sits in the shop with his head down. When David arrives home, Peggotty greets him and comforts him. Miss Murdstone only asks him if he has remembered his clothes. In retrospect, David admits that he cannot recall the order of all the events around this time, but he describes going to his mother's funeral with the few people who attend. Afterward, Peggotty comes to him and tells him about his mother's last moments. She says that his mother died with her head on Peggotty's arm", "analysis": ""}
