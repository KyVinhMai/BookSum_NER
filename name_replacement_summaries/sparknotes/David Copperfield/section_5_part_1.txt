He takes his leave of Agnes and Mr. Wickfield, and Doctor Strong throws a going-away party in David's honor. At the party, Annie's mother reveals that Jack Maldon has sent Doctor Strong a letter in which he claims that he is ill and likely to return soon on sick leave. But Annie has received another letter from Jack Maldon indicating that he wants to return because he misses her. The next morning, David leaves on the London coach and tries to appear as manly as possible. Nonetheless, the coachman asks him to resign his seat of honor to an older man. David spends the evening at an inn, where the waiter pokes fun at his youthfulness and the chambermaid gives him a pitiful room.

David and Steerforth are happily reunited, and the inn staff immediately treat David with respect", "analysis": ""}
