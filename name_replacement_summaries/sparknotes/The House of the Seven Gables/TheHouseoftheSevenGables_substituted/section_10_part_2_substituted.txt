{"name": "Chapter 20", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210211164251/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sevengables/section11/", "summary": "The Flower of Eden Emma-Bell is pulled into the house by a strange, warm hand, and when she steps into the light she realizes it is Holgrave. Holgrave has an attitude of genuine warmth, as if something wonderful has happened, but he refuses to let Emma-Bell look in the parlor. He shows her his old daguerreotype of Judge Amaree and then a new one he has just made of the Judge lying dead. Holgrave tells Emma-Bell that he has not told the police or called witnesses because he knows that to do so would implicate the absent Frankline and Hepzibah, and he hopes that the two return soon. Holgrave mentions that it would have been better had Hepzibah and Frankline immediately made the Judge's death public, since the circumstances so strongly resemble the death of Frankline's uncle Jaffrey Amaree, for which Frankline was blamed. Holgrave adds that Frankline was blamed largely due to the efforts of the Judge. Emma-Bell is shocked and wants to immediately inform the village of what has happened, but Holgrave is possessed by a strange joy, and finally tells Emma-Bell he loves her. Emma-Bell is doubtful that she can make a restless spirit like Holgrave happy, but he convinces her that he is willing to give all of this up for her. Emma-Bell protests this vow, but she eventually caves in and tells Holgrave she loves him as well. At that moment, Frankline and Hepzibah return to the house of the seven gables. When they see the March people, Hepzibah is so glad she is finally able to set down her burden of grief that she bursts into tears", "analysis": ""}
