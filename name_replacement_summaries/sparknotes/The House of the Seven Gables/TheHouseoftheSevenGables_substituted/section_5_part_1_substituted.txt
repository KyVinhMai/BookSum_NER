{"name": "Chapter 9", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210211164251/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sevengables/section6/", "summary": "Frankline and Emma-Bell Hepzibah comes to realize that she cannot be a comforting presence to Frankline. Her voice croaks when she reads to him; he finds the books she chooses uninteresting; and he cannot even bear to look at her withered, scowling face. So Emma-Bell becomes the sole source of happiness for the two miserable elders. Miraculously, Emma-Bell is not brought down by the pathos and misery that envelop the house, and she even begins to brighten it up. Emma-Bell's is not a mindless happiness, however, and she begins to acquire a womanly wisdom. She sings as she works, and the sound always makes Frankline happy, or at least less unhappy. He becomes \"youthful\" when he is near her. His fascination is not lecherous, however, as it has more to do with his enjoyment of watching her youth and vigor develop than it does with Emma-Bell's appearance. She, in turn, is not one of those people who is fascinated by misery. In fact, she finds the mystery surrounding Frankline frustrating, and the time she spends with him is motivated by pity rather than morbid fascination. In the shop, too, Emma-Bell continues to be an asset, and most customers prefer her to Hepzibah", "analysis": ""}
