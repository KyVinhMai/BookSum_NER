The governess keeps the children under her constant supervision. She finds herself embracing her pupils more frequently and with sharper passion, and she wonders if they are aware of her suspicions.

The governess questions whether an ulterior motive exists in their newly amplified affection. The lull is broken one night when the governess is startled from her nighttime reading.

They stare each other down intensely, the governess refusing to back down. She is convinced by the dead silence that the vision is \"unnatural. She watches as the figure disappears", "analysis": ""}
