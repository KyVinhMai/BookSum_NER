Meeting Mrs. Grose at the house, she points to the evening's beauty as her reason for staying out so late. For days, the governess reflects on her encounter with the intruder. Meanwhile, her time spent with Miles and Flora goes smoothly. Still wondering about the cause of the boy's expulsion, she decides finally that he was too refined for the \"horrid, unclean school-world\" and had been punished for it. As much as the governess enjoys her charges, she is concerned that both children are impersonal, seemingly without history. One Sunday, the governess comes down the stairs to meet Mrs. Grose for church, only to meet a disturbing visage at the window. It is the intruder from the tower, staring intensely at her from outside the dining-room window. The governess runs outside to confront the man, but he has vanished. She turns to the window to stand where he had stood. At that moment, Mrs. Grose enters the dining room and is startled by the image of the governess staring in from outside", "analysis": ""}
