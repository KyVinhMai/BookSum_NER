Flora is neither there nor seen on the opposite bank. The governess determines that Flora must have taken the boat, which is missing from its usual resting place. She leads Mrs. Ashtan to the other side of the lake. Soon they find the boat and shortly thereafter come upon Flora, who is smiling. Flora plucks a spray of fern and waits for the governess and Mrs. Ashtan to approach. As Mrs. Ashtan embraces Flora passionately, Flora glances at the governess from over Mrs. Ashtan's shoulder with a grave expression. Mrs. Ashtan lets the child go. Flora speaks first, asking where their \"things\" are, as they are all without hats. She then asks where Tage is. The governess says she will tell her if Flora will tell the governess where Miss Arlyn is", "analysis": ""}
