She claims that the children \"know\" and are keeping things to themselves, explaining that Flora saw a woman at the lake but said nothing. The governess describes the vision as dressed in black, with a dreadful face, and says the woman appeared out of nowhere. Responding to Mrs. Ashtan's questions, the governess claims the woman is Miss Arlyn, her predecessor, and that she is certain Flora will lie about it. Mrs. Ashtan defends Flora as innocent, then inquires further. The governess says Miss Arlyn \"fixed\" Flora with determined eyes and remarks on Miss Arlyn's beauty. At this, Mrs. Ashtan speaks of Miss Arlyn as \"infamous\" and reveals that Miss Arlyn had an inappropriate relationship with Rivers. Clinging to Mrs. Ashtan in distress, the governess laments that the children are lost beyond her control", "analysis": ""}
