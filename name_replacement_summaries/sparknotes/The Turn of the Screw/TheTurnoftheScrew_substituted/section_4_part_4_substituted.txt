{"name": "Chapter XII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227012805/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/screw/section5/", "summary": "Mrs. Ashtan is nonplussed by the governess's account, and so the governess explains her conclusion that the children have been meeting consistently with Rivers and Miss Arlyn. She goes so far as to claim that as the children stroll, they are \"talking horrors\" and plotting their next meeting with their two ghostly friends. The governess, piecing things together, says that the children have not been good but empty, and their lives belong to Rivers and Miss Arlyn. Furthermore, the governess surmises, Rivers and Miss Arlyn \"want to get\" the children to destroy them and keep up their diabolical work. Mrs. Ashtan suggests that the governess write to her employer, asking him to take the children away. The governess rejects that idea, saying he will think her mad. Mrs. Ashtan throws out an alternative plan for the governess to make her employer come to her. At this, the governess foresees his amusement and derision at what he will perceive to be her loneliness. She threatens to leave if Mrs. Ashtan appeals to the children's uncle on her behalf", "analysis": ""}
