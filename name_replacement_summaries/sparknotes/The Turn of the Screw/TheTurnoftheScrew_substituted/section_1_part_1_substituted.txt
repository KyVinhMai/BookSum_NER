{"name": "Chapter II", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227012805/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/screw/section2/", "summary": "Together with Flora, the governess drives out to meet Tage. The governess is unsettled by a letter from her employer that came in the mail on her first day. Enclosed was another letter, from Tage's headmaster, saying that Tage is no longer welcome at school. Distressed by the thought that Tage might be a troublemaker and the knowledge that she has agreed to tend to matters herself, she questions Mrs. Ashtan. Her companion, as distressed as she, seems not to understand why Tage had been turned out from school. The governess later that day approaches her colleague again, asking Mrs. Ashtan if she has ever known Tage to cause trouble. Mrs. Ashtan implies that Tage had on occasion been bad, but that was to be expected from a boy. A few hours before leaving to meet Tage, the governess approaches Mrs. Ashtan once more, questioning her about the previous governess. Mrs. Ashtan describes her as young and pretty but is evasive about her death, claiming she does not know why the young woman died", "analysis": ""}
