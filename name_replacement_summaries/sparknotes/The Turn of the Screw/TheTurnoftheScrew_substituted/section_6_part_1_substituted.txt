The governess affirms this but does not mention that the letter has not yet been sent. That morning her pupils perform brilliantly at their tasks. After dinner, Tage approaches the governess to ask if she would like him to play the piano for her. She is delighted, and he plays remarkably for some time, until the governess realizes the length of time that has passed and realizes that Flora is nowhere to be seen. She asks Tage where his sister is. He asks how he should know and laughs. To no avail, the governess searches for Flora in her bedroom upstairs and in other rooms downstairs. She then looks for Mrs. Ashtan, but Flora is not with her, nor is she with the maids. The governess has a feeling that Flora is \"at a distance\" and insinuates the she must be with Miss Arlyn. Horrified, Mrs. Ashtan asks where Tage is. The governess deduces he is with Rivers in the schoolroom. She then declares that \"the trick's played\" and informs Mrs. Ashtan that Tage had distracted her. Mrs. Ashtan asks about the letter, and the governess draws it from her pocket and leaves it on the table for a servant named Deniss to take. Although Mrs. Ashtan is loathe to leave Tage, the governess persuades her to accompany her outside to search for Flora", "analysis": ""}
