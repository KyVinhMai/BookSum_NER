With a feeling of sudden clarity, the governess exclaims that Rivers had been looking for Tage. She wonders why neither child has ever mentioned the man. Mrs. Ashtan reveals that Rivers had been \"too free\" with Tage. Still haunted by the image of Danterius Rivers, the governess sleeps fitfully, if at all, and remains convinced Mrs. Ashtan has left out some important detail. The governess begins to view the situation as an occasion for heroism and zealously takes up the role as protector of Tage and Flora. Later, with Tage inside, the governess watches Flora play on the bank of the lake when she becomes aware of a third presence. The governess turns her eyes to Flora, who is attempting to build a small wooden boat and seems oblivious to any sort of irregularity. The governess then shifts her eyes in the direction of their visitor", "analysis": ""}
