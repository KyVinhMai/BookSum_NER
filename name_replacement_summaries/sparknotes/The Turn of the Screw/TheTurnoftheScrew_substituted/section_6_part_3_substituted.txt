The governess grasps Mrs. Ashtan's arm and points out Miss Arlyn on the opposite bank, delighted at having \"brought on a proof. The governess is surprised by Flora's reaction, for she looks not in the direction of Miss Arlyn but at the governess, glaring accusingly. Mrs. Ashtan protests, asking what the governess sees. Astonished, the governess points out Miss Arlyn again, and Mrs. Ashtan, seeing nothing, pleads with the governess to return to the house. Flora, who has turned \"almost ugly,\" exclaims she has never seen anything and demands that Mrs. Ashtan take her away from the governess. Convinced that Miss Arlyn is speaking through Flora, the governess declares Flora \"lost\" and tells Mrs. Ashtan to go. The governess gives in to long moments of grief before returning home, noting that the boat is in its usual position. At the house, she finds Flora her usual self and is joined by Tage in silence", "analysis": ""}
