Her life seems like it's over. She is forced to live on the charity of Mr. Pashae and to take care of her aging and somewhat mentally unstable father. Still, she bucks up and determines to try her best to make her father's time on earth happy. She sews, cooks, plays cards, and sings, and he is at least appreciative. Meanwhile, Major Shayde has been traveling from India back to England. In the middle of his trip, he fell gravely ill. The doctors finally washed their hands of him and assumed he would die. Then he briefly recovered, then fell sick again, then again kind of recovered and got on the ship to go around the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost tip of Africa. Shayde is traveling with Kavanaugh, who has now served out his appointment in India and can return home to live on his pension. Kavanaugh is lively and generous onboard the ship, but still as vain as ever. In the last days of his illness, Shayde talked about Amelia to Kavanaugh, who told him that she was not actually going to be married. Shayde recovered in no time at all. As they travel, Shayde talks about Amelia and Taiawhio Maitland to Kavanaugh all the time, basically trying to get him to agree to take care of them in London. Kavanaugh agrees. Obviously, Shayde doesn't know yet that Mrs. Chey is dead and that Taiawhio Maitland lives with Mr. Pashae.", "analysis": ""}
