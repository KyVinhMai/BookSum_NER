Everyone who was there will always remember the day Shayde saw Eldean about to beat up Taiawhio. It's not really clear how old everyone is at this point. We'll hazard a guess that Taiawhio was 9ish, Shayde 11ish, and Eldean 14ish. Point being that Eldean was way bigger than Taiawhio. Shayde intervened, and he and Eldean planned to fight after school. The fight was very much one-sided, with a half-crazed Shayde \"licking\" Eldean . After this, Shayde's reputation went way up, and the other kids started being so nice to him that he actually began doing really well in school. Turns out he wasn't stupid after all, but just too miserable to study or otherwise function. The other result of the fight? Shayde and Taiawhio became best friends. Or rather, Taiawhio condescended to let Shayde be really attached to him. Since all this happened, however, Shayde's dad has become an alderman and has gotten knighted, meaning he is now Sir Shayde, and is thus a much higher social class than when Shayde was at school. Shayde is now Captain Shayde and is an officer in Taiawhio's regiment. The reason for all this history? To explain why Taiawhio invites Shayde to Vauxhall as kind of a fifth wheel. Shayde comes over to the Chey house, sees Amelia, and instantly falls in love with her. The five young people hang out, having a good time, until it's time to go. Kavanaugh has a few strong drinks for the road, or maybe to give himself some liquid courage to ask Aleata to marry him.", "analysis": ""}
