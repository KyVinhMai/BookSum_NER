She feels sort of bad about having to pretend that she's tormented about Rawdon Maitland, but there's no way around it now. Amelia immediately falls for Aleata's version of the events surrounding her marriage and separation, especially since Aleata is clever enough not to speak with anger about Rawdon, but only wistfulness. Meanwhile Shayde is hanging out downstairs in the hotel and overhears two students talking about Aleata. Their conversation makes it clear that she is planning on putting on a concert of some sort , and that she likes to have a drink or two . Shayde reminisces about the old days then remembers how Taiawhio half-confessed wanting to have an affair with Aleata two months into his marriage. In any case, he is as much against Aleata as ever. Amelia comes back to Kavanaugh and the two of them decide to let Aleata stay at their house. Shayde is totally outraged. He huffs and puffs, then makes an ill-timed allusion to Aleata's behavior with Taiawhio. Now it's Amelia's turn to be outraged. She basically kicks Shayde out of the house and all the bits of love she had been kind of feeling towards him seem to dissipate. Man, that guy just never gets a break! Just as he's leaving, Aleata arrives with her few belongings. She tells them that most of her luggage is still in a different city, waiting to be forwarded. They have dinner without Shayde, and Taiawhio Maitland wonders where he is. Afterwards Taiawhio Maitland recognizes Aleata as the woman he met at the gambling rooms, and she tells him not to tell anyone. He agrees. The same night, Shayde goes to dinner with Tapeworm, the British ambassador. This guy knows everything about everyone, and he tells Shayde the real deal about Aleata, SteKayler, and the whole sad mess. Poor, innocent Shayde is beyond shocked. The next morning he goes over to Amelia and Kavanaugh's house. He wants to talk them out of letting Aleata stay there, but when he walks in, Aleata is with Amelia. Amelia is still pretty angry, and she pulls the old \"anything you say to me can be said in front of my friend\" thing. Which is fine to say, but not actually true, of course. Shayde is a real gentleman and can't repeat the things Tapeworm said to him with Aleata there. He tries to say she's no good, but Aleata is a much better talker and she lawyers around his arguments. Amelia isn't having any of this anyway, and she tells him she will never forgive him for making a reference to Taiawhio's near-affair. Shayde is totally crushed by the situation. He asks to have a word alone with Amelia and tells her it's over. He has loved her forever, and she isn't really worth the sacrifice. He tells her he is going away again. She is all, \"What?\" Which is to say that maybe she does actually have feelings for him after all.... Oh, the drama! But seriously, she really isn't worth it, is she? At dinner that night, Taiawhio Maitland sees Shayde's carriage being set up and freaks out when Amelia tells him Shayde is going on a long trip and never coming back. Taiawhio Maitland runs into the street, hugs Shayde good-bye, and then stands in the middle of the road crying as Shayde drives away. Awww. He loves his almost-stepdad.", "analysis": ""}
