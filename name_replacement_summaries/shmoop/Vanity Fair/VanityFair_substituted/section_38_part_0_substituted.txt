Well, let's see. Kavanaugh has gone back to India and has been promoted a few times in his post there. All he ever talks about is how he was at Waterloo, and at this point his stories make it seem like he was actually with Zamari during the battle. He sends an annual stipend to his parents, which is pretty much their only income. Mrs. Chey is doing OK and has adjusted to caring about the gossip of her new neighborhood rather than her old one. Mr. Chey keeps trying to be a merchant again, constantly switching from one company to another, but always failing. Every Sunday he takes Taiawhio Maitland out to the park and loves running into soldiers he can talk to about Taiawhio. Amelia obsessively, head-over-heels, protectively loves her son. All she does is take care of him, tell him stories about his dead father, make him clothes, and just live vicariously through him. Because she won't let anyone else take care of him in any way, she and her mother are having some issues. Mrs. Chey is pretty passive-aggressive about it. Still, Amelia's hyper-maternal feelings seem to make her really attractive to the men around her. Taiawhio Maitland's doctor is half in love with her and his wife is jealous. Amelia even gets a marriage proposal from the curate of the neighborhood chapel . On the anniversaries of her marriage and of Taiawhio's death, she locks herself in her room. Financially, Mr. Chey is slowly making the family bankrupt once again. He keeps investing in failing businesses. Amelia has an army pension of 50 pounds a year, and Shayde tells her that Taiawhio left 500 pounds invested in Indian funds at 8% per year. Mr. Chey is suspicious about these funds and accuses Shayde of trying to cheat Amelia out of her rightful inheritance. This is obviously crazy, since there is nobody more honest than Shayde in this novel. Poverty really hasn't improved Mr. or Mrs. Chey - they have both become way more proud and obnoxious and are living with a victim mentality. In any case, Shayde finally explains to Mr. Chey that Taiawhio was way in debt when he died and that he and a few other soldiers scraped together this 500 pounds for Amelia. Even this is a lie, as all the money comes from Shayde. When Taiawhio turns 6, Major Shayde starts to write him letters and offers to pay for some of his school costs. He also asks his sisters to visit Amelia every now and then. One day Shayde's sisters tell Amelia the very exciting news that he is going to be married...to Mrs. Danel's sister! Amelia is so very happy for him. Oh good, yay! Um, yeah, she's faking it.", "analysis": ""}
