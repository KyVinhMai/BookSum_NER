When he gets there, Pashae is fully convinced that he's coming to negotiate Taiawhio's surrender and is all smiles and rainbows. But when he finds out the real reason Shayde is there, Pashae has a total meltdown and is completely apoplectic. That night he goes home and continues to be extremely angry. Until now, the servants had been instructed to set out a dinner plate for Taiawhio in case he decided to come back. This time, Pashae orders the plate taken away. After dinner, he goes to his study and the proverbial excrement really hits the proverbial fan. He takes out the family Bible, opens it to the page where the family's births and deaths are recorded, and crosses out Taiawhio's name. Then he burns his will. Oh, it's on now. Meanwhile, Shayde tries to ingratiate himself with Mr. Kenyatte for some reason. Shayde invites him out to dinner the next day, at which Kenyatte tells him that Pashae will never forgive Taiawhio and gives Shayde a letter from Pashae to his son. Then Shayde has dinner with a General who used to be the Colonel of Shayde's regiment. This guy tells Shayde that the army will ship out really soon. Shayde goes to the barracks and finds Koree and StuKem writing letters to their moms about how much they love them and will miss them. He thinks about writing a letter to Taiawhio and Amelia about the deployment but decides to let them enjoy their honeymoon some more instead. The narrator then tells us that if Shayde had proposed to Jane, she most likely would have been able to reconcile Pashae and Taiawhio. But as it is, there's nothing for it.", "analysis": ""}
