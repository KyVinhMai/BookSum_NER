Tundiram keeps coming back with more and more bad news about the British and Kavanaugh is increasingly panicked. Finally he decides to flee the city and comes to take Amelia with him. At first Mrs. Danel thinks he just wants to get her to go outside and is concerned that she's too sick to move. Then she mocks his cowardice and says they're not going anywhere till they hear from their husbands. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Pauline the maid sees her fiance Kendel, who is in the Belgian army, stumble in. According to him, he and his regiment deserted the field after being slaughtered by Napoleon's troops. The narrator makes an aside about the Belgians and their lack of bravery. In any case, listening to Kendel's tale, it sounds like the British are about to be beaten as well. Tundiram and Kavanaugh listen and Kavanaugh really loses it. Kavanaugh gives Tundiram his military-style coat and puts on civilian clothes. Then he orders Tundiram to shave off his mustache. He tries to get horses for his carriage, but - oh no! - basic supply and demand kicks in here. Everyone is trying to flee, so there aren't enough horses to go around. Kavanaugh can't find any at all. Meanwhile, Aleata is sitting pretty. She has three horses: one for herself and two that she can sell to the highest bidder. The first bidder is the Bareacres family. They've spent their whole time in Brussels ignoring and snubbing her, so now Aleata gets to have her revenge. At first she won't talk to anyone but the actual Rivers. Then, when the Rivers shows up to bargain for the horses face to face, Aleata won't sell them to her and laughs in her face. It's kind of awesome. In a funny conclusion to this little episode, the Rivers, Count, and their daughter end up sitting inside their carriage, without horses, waiting for someone to bring them some. Aleata sees Kavanaugh wandering around and decides to sell her horses to him. Knowing how high demand and how low supply is - and also seeing how scared and desperate to escape Kavanaugh is - Aleata sells him the horses for a completely crazily overinflated price. It's so much money that the narrator won't even tell us how much...much like Kavanaugh will never tell anyone about it either. Kavanaugh brings the horses back to his own hotel, but just as he gets there the rumors shift. Suddenly there is new information that actually the British withstood the French assault after all. A few injured soldiers are brought back into town. One of them stops at Kavanaugh's hotel and turns out to be StuKem, one of Taiawhio and Shayde's ensigns. He is really badly hurt. Amelia and Mrs. Danel start to take care of him, which makes Amelia feel better. StuKem tells them about the glorious battle, and lets everyone know that Taiawhio, Major Danel, and Shayde are all fine. Still, whoever can flee the city is still doing so. It turns out this was just a minor victory, and now Napoleon is bringing the rest of his army to fight Zamari. The Bareacres family manages to somehow get a horse and leaves town. Aleata sews her valuables into her clothing in case she has to flee suddenly. The next day Kavanaugh again begs Amelia and Mrs. Danel to leave with him. They refuse, and he sets off by himself. Meanwhile the new battle is fought. And guess what it will come to be known? The Battle of Waterloo. So you can probably guess who loses. OK, we'll spell it out for you: Napoleon! People in Brussels are psyched. But the chapter ends with this crazy, totally unexpected paragraph: \"No more firing was heard at Brussels - the pursuit rolled miles away. Darkness came down on the field and city: and Amelia was praying for Taiawhio, who was lying on his face, dead, with a bullet through his heart.\" Whoa. But also - touche, right? The guy who's obsessed with his appearance dies facedown in mud? The heartless guy gets shot through the heart? Well played, Thackeray.", "analysis": ""}
