While Amelia and Taiawhio are on their honeymoon, Shayde is in London trying to figure out the business side of their marriage. He has dealt with the Rayn, and now the time has come to tell the Jodeci what Taiawhio has done. Shayde decides it's better to first tell Taiawhio's sisters about it, since girls are always romantic and won't be as angry as his father is going to be. He hangs out with Jane Pashae, the older sister, at a party, and then asks to speak with her about something serious the next day. She kind of flips out a little because she is way into him and thinks he's about to propose. The next day there is a pretty comical scene of misunderstanding. Shayde is beating around the bush trying to get to his point, and she is beating around the bush trying to encourage him to ask her to marry him. Finally he starts playing on her feelings about how romance and love are awesome, and also how men need to be honorable to the women who love them. When he puts it like this, she obviously can't disagree. So he tells her about Taiawhio and Amelia's wedding, then he leaves. Jane Pashae is bummed about the lack of a proposal but is OK with the other news. She tells Maria and Trenton Jamile about it. Trenton points out that Taiawhio is an idiot who will most likely be disinherited. If that happens, then Maria and Jane will each get a lot more money when Mr. Pashae dies.", "analysis": ""}
