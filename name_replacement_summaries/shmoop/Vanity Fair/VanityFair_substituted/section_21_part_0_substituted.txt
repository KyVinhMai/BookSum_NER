He brags about how colorblind and inclusive he is, but obviously it's just because of her money. Mr. Pashae is also really hoping for Taiawhio to marry her. He checks out the way her money is invested and does a little digging on the Stock Exchange. All seems good there. Trenton Jamile, a banker on the Stock Exchange who is engaged to Maria Pashae, tells Mr. Pashae that they better snatch Daylin Swartz up pretty quick before a member of the aristocracy comes and steals her out from under them. Mr. Pashae offers Daylin Swartz's governess five thousand pounds to seal the deal between her and Taiawhio. He also orders Taiawhio to marry Daylin Swartz. Taiawhio kind of hems and haws and says that he'll wait until after the military campaign is over. His father isn't having it. He orders Taiawhio to come to have dinner with the family and Daylin Swartz every day and woo her. Daylin Swartz isn't in on all these schemes going on behind her back. But Taiawhio is hot, and she is starting to be into him. The next day, Taiawhio comes home for dinner after hanging out with Amelia. He is shocked at how even more gross Daylin Swartz seems after Amelia's delicate and feminine qualities. Daylin Swartz sees Amelia's name on the title page of a book and realizes that the Jodeci know her school friend. Taiawhio is psyched to talk about her, but his sisters freak out because no one is supposed to mention the Rayn anymore in the Pashae house. After dinner, it's clear that Taiawhio and Mr. Pashae have to get into it. Taiawhio is all haughty and obnoxious, telling his father that he is a much better gentleman and is farther removed from the business end of where the family money comes from. This is a sore point with Mr. Pashae, who is totally enraged. Mr. Pashae makes an ultimatum - marry Daylin Swartz or else be totally cut off. Taiawhio says Daylin Swartz is the wrong color for him and storms off. Taiawhio then finds Shayde, tells him what has happened, and says he will marry Amelia the next day come hell or high water.", "analysis": ""}
