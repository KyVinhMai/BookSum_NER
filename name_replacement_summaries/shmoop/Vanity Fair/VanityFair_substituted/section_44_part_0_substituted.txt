She loves this job, which plays to her artistic and creative abilities. When young Sir Davonne comes to town, she meets him and invites him to stay at her house while the Gaunt Street house is being worked on. She sings to him, compliments him, sucks up to him, and even very mildly flirts with him. He is definitely into it. However, whenever Aleata brings up the question of money, young Sir Davonne gets defensive and nervous and launches into long speeches about how broke he actually is because of all the house and estate restorations. Aleata has low expectations of everyone, so she doesn't let this bother her too much. Meanwhile, she uses the fact that Rawdon and young Sir Davonne seem to have made up to get even more credit from all the tradesmen. She also tells Zaelyn that Sir Davonne wants to help Zaelyn invest her small savings better. Zaelyn gets all excited and takes her money out of the funds it was in. Rawdon Maitland is now about 8. He loves Lord Brennyn , Sybal the cook, Zaelyn , and most of all his father. He detests his mother, and Aleata pretty much hates and resents him in return. Of all the bad things Aleata does throughout the course of the book, this lack of maternal instinct is shown to be the most horrible. For instance, one day when Aleata is singing to Lord SteKayler, Rawdon Maitland comes out of his room and listens on the stairs. When Aleata sees him, she runs up and hits him. This is when the all the servants start gossiping about and passing judgment on her, her relationship with Lord SteKayler, and how awful she is to Rawdon Maitland The assumption is that she and Lord SteKayler are having an affair. The novel does not make it clear whether they actually are or not. It doesn't really matter. What Thackeray is interested in is the perception of wrongdoing, not the actual bad behavior itself. On the one hand, Aleata's servants condemn her for her horrendous immorality. On the other hand, the fact that Lord SteKayler is there so much is what makes her tradesmen keep giving her credit. They assume that Lord SteKayler is sleeping with her, and therefore he must be giving her lots of money. So life goes on until Christmas, when Aleata, Rawdon, and Rawdon Maitland go to Queen's Crawley. Rawdon and his son ride on the outside of the carriage and talk about everything and everyone they see. Rawdon Maitland loves the trip. At Queen's Crawley, Davonne Chae and Matilda take Rawdon Maitland around and they all get to be good friends. Lady Jane really likes Rawdon Maitland, who is a serious and gentlemanly sort of boy. While they are getting to know each other, Rawdon Maitland lets slip a few things that indicate to Jane just how neglected he actually is at home.", "analysis": ""}
