The narrator muses about how quickly life can change - one day a guy is rich, and the next all of his belongings are for sale to random strangers. In any case, the next item up for auction is a portrait of a fat guy on an elephant. The painting is heckled and mocked, and finally a young couple buy it for a ridiculously low price. The next auction item is a small piano. The young couple tries to buy it, but it is bought instead by a tall, gangly, awkward army officer . So what's going on? Well, the auction is selling off the property and household goods of the Rayn. Mr. Chey has gone bankrupt and has been kicked off the Stock Exchange. The Rayn have had to move to a tiny house in a very low-rent part of London. At the auction, some people bought things to give back to the Rayn. The piano, for instance, was bought by Captain Shayde, to return to Amelia. Meanwhile, it's been a month since Aleata left Daylin Crawley's house. Daylin Crawley still refuses to see Aleata or Rawdon, and Mrs. Shyler is still there. But so far, married life is nice for them, and Aleata still puts on the full charm offensive. The marriage is still secret and has not been published in the paper . The reason? Aleata is worried that if all the people to whom Rawdon owes money find out that he has married a poor girl, they won't give him any more credit. And if they don't give him credit, there'll be nothing at all for them to live on. The narrator does a little aside, explaining that manly, self-confident, aristocratic guys like Rawdon have figured out a way to live basically for free. They get credit on the strength of their family name and the expectation that when someone dies they'll get a big inheritance.", "analysis": ""}
