Now back to Pashae Sadtown. So, Mr. Pashae and Taiawhio's sisters are totally destroyed by Taiawhio's death. The women weep openly, but Mr. Pashae doesn't talk about his grief to anyone. His feelings are split. On the one hand, he is really sad that his son is dead. On the other hand, he is furious that now Taiawhio will never apologize for marrying Amelia. Still, he does commission a hideously gaudy sculpture honoring Taiawhio for their church. One day, a few months later, Shayde's father stops by, tells Pashae that Shayde has been promoted to Major, and gives him a letter. It's the letter Taiawhio wrote on the eve of the battle. Pashae reads it but can't see the emotions Taiawhio was feeling while writing it. It's kind of like when you write an email with no emoticons and your tone of voice doesn't come across. Taiawhio meant to be all emotional and loving and full of remorse, but his father just sees stiffness and pride. He stays just as mad as ever. Sometime later, Pashae announces that he will travel to Belgium. Taiawhio's sisters know that this is where Amelia still is and they wonder whether their father is going there to forgive her. Pashae gets to Brussels, goes to see Taiawhio's grave, and then takes a tour of the battlefield where he died, accompanied by a soldier in Taiawhio's old company. This soldier, among other things, tells him that Amelia is now finally recovered from her shock and deep insanity after Taiawhio's death. The next day Pashae sees her driving in a carriage with Shayde, and he declares that he hates her just as much as ever. She doesn't even see him and still seems totally crazy. Shayde does see him, follows him to his hotel, and tells him that Amelia is pregnant. Pashae gets all defensive about how he was a totally awesome father and Taiawhio was a totally hateful son. Shayde realizes that Pashae will never help Amelia out financially. OK, a little pause. We skip ahead a year into the future. Amelia really was going crazy, but when she gave birth she started to recover her ability to love and be emotionally connected to the world. She is a really, really doting mother. She won't let anyone else touch the baby. But still, at least she's not catatonic any more, right? Shayde is the baby Taiawhio's godfather. He brings Amelia and baby Taiawhio back to London to her parents' house. They can see that Shayde loves her, but Amelia only has eyes for Taiawhio Maitland Finally, Shayde can't deal with the situation any more and tells Amelia that he's leaving for a long time. She only half hears him, tells him she'll write about the baby, then shushes him as he goes away.", "analysis": ""}
