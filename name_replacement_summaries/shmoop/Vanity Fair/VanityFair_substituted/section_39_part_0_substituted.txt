Here's an update. Mr. and Mrs. Shyler are totally enraged that Daylin Crawley only left them 5,000 pounds after she died . But Mrs. Shyler makes the best of it, making her ugly daughter go out into society as much as possible in order to find a husband. They act so non-poor and non-bankrupt that they manage to almost convince everyone that they did actually end up with some of the inheritance. Mr. Shyler and Mr. Davonne had a huge fight and are no longer on speaking terms. And what about Sir Davonne, you ask? Ugh, get ready to be grossed out. At some point after their marriage, Mr. Davonne and Lady Jane went to visit him. They found: 1) many of the estate trees cut down and sold for lumber ; 2) most of the servants gone and the mansion and grounds abandoned and neglected; 3) Sir Davonne totally gross and no longer even pretending to be anything other than a drunkard; and finally 4) Daylin Reese, the butler's daughter, installed as housekeeper, running the house and hoping to be the next Lady Crawley. Ewww! Sir Davonne gives Jane some of dead Lady Crawley's jewels, which he's been hiding from Daylin Reese. Totally appalled, Davonne and Jane run away as fast as they can. Everyone is also freaking out that Sir Davonne might actually marry this horrible young woman. To Sir Davonne, it's just all very funny. All his old friends shun and ignore him, which he also laughs off. All he does is get drunk with Mr. Reese every night and hang out with Daylin Reese every day. Then finally one day he has a fit of some sort. He loses his ability to speak and then falls into a coma. Mr. and Mrs. Shyler hurry to the house and find Daylin Reese trying to open the cabinets in his study with a bunch of keys. Mrs. Shyler accuses her of being a thief and threatens to have her arrested, but then she and her father are allowed to quickly and quietly go away and are never heard from again.", "analysis": ""}
