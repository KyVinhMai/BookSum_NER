It seems that Lord SteKayler has really been on a mission to clear everyone out of Aleata's house. What could he possibly be up to? The first thing he does is use his political clout to get Rawdon Maitland a spot at prestigious boarding school. Rawdon is upset at the idea of his son going away. He can't deny that education is important, but Rawdon Maitland is really his only friend and companion in life. When Rawdon tries to tell Aleata about his feelings, she just mocks him. So Rawdon talks about his son with Lady Jane instead. Not surprisingly, Aleata isn't that sad to see Rawdon Maitland go. Zaelyn is the one who packs up his things, and Zaelyn and Rawdon hang out together afterwards crying and talking about the boy. Rawdon Maitland does very well in school. It helps that he is clearly highly connected and that he is a good-looking, happy kid. He tells his father all about his classmates, and Rawdon brags about his son's achievements to his friends. Aleata finds all of this ridiculous and starts to find Rawdon contemptible. OK, so that's person one out of the house. Person two is Zaelyn. Lord SteKayler realizes that Aleata must not have paid Zaelyn back with the money he gave her. He talks to Zaelyn and she tells him the real amount Aleata owes her . SteKayler decides Rawdon must be behind the lie. When he confronts Aleata about it, she also tells him she was just following her horrible husband's orders. What SteKayler doesn't suspect is that Rawdon knows nothing about anything, and that Aleata is keeping the money in a secret place for herself. Finally, SteKayler has a better idea. The SteKaylers of course have an estate in the country. They don't go there often - once every two years or so - and the housekeeper there is getting very old. He offers Zaelyn the chance to replace her. This is an amazing offer, since it would basically take care of all of Jacquise's needs for the rest of her life. Zaelyn is thrilled and asks only that Rawdon Maitland be allowed to visit her. When Rawdon tells Lady Jane and Davonne about this offer, they are surprised, suspicious, and worried. Aleata's moment is the sun is already starting to cloud over. All her flirting is starting to be noticed and more and more rumors are swirling around her, damaging her reputation. Jane thinks a woman as full of life as Aleata cannot go to parties alone, and so if Zaelyn isn't with her any more, then Rawdon needs to step up and be with her all the time. Rawdon does just that. He stops going to his club, stops going to see his friends, and instead starts going everywhere with Aleata. If she is invited out by herself, he makes her decline the invitation. Aleata actually seems surprisingly happy about Rawdon's sudden concern for her. She smiles at him, is nice to him, kisses him and generally acts very loving towards him. Rawdon decides he was suspicious about nothing, since she clearly loves him and just needs to be with people out in society, which isn't such a crime. The only problem, Rawdon decides, is to figure out how to make her like Rawdon Maitland a little bit more. It's in this state of mind that he is arrested for debts.", "analysis": ""}
