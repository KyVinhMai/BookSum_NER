She lives on the upper floor of a quasi-Bohemian kind of hotel where all sorts of people from students to traveling merchants are staying. It's not a nice place, but Aleata kind of loves it there. She has reverted almost entirely to the kind of life she led as a little girl with her artist father. She's full of life and happy to be in the thick of relative seediness. When Kavanaugh knocks she quickly hides her liquor, lets him in the room, and immediately begins to tell him her story. Her version is that she is blameless and a victim of the Crawley family's evil scheming. Also running through her story is the implication that she is still deeply in love with Kavanaugh. After a while, Kavanaugh \"went away, convinced that she was the most virtuous, as she was one of the most fascinating of women, and revolving in his mind all sorts of benevolent schemes for her welfare\" . So yeah, Aleata can still bring it. Kavanaugh tells Amelia and Shayde about how sad and miserable Aleata is. Shayde is all, yeah right. But as soon as she hears that Aleata was \"forced\" to give up little Rawdon Maitland, Amelia decides to go visit her and try to make her feel better. The three of them get ready and make their way to Aleata's hotel. When they get there, Amelia runs and hugs and kisses Aleata.", "analysis": ""}
