{"name": "Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201020004139/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/vanity-fair-thackeray/summary/chapter-3", "summary": "Aleata and Amelia make their way downstairs and meet Kavanaugh, who turns out to be a very fat, awkward, shy man. Aleata tries to flirt on his level, putting on some super-virginal airs. Kavanaugh is kind of into it, but when his father, Mr. Chey, comes home and starts to make fun of the fashion-victim way Kavanaugh is dressed, the whole scene gets to be too much for him. Kavanaugh tries to escape the house, until Mrs. Chey tells him about the yummy Indian-food dinner that's waiting. The narrator chimes in with an important little tidbit: basically, Aleata has to arrange her own marriage since she doesn't have a mom to do it for her. Now we get a little background info on Kavanaugh. Turns out he works for the East India Company as the revenue collector of Boggley Wollah . Also, turns out he's really, really into his clothes and fancy lifestyle, and is very vain about himself and his appearance. Except he is also painfully lonely and doesn't really know how to be around other people. And, to top it all off, he is fat and self-conscious about it. He wears all sorts of complicated girdles to hide it and buys clothes that are too tight for him. Brain Snack: Thackeray described himself a fat, somewhat awkward guy, so Kavanaugh is a bit of a self-parody. At dinner, Aleata is all of a sudden super-interested in all things Indian. She tries a curry dish and is sort of gasping from all the cayenne pepper and spices, when Kavanaugh offers her a chili pepper. Thinking it'll be cool , she eats it whole and has a mouth-on-fire attack. But she is a good sport about it, and Kavanaugh and Mr. Chey like her. After dinner, Mr. Chey tells Kavanaugh that Aleata digs him. Predictably, this freaks Kavanaugh out, and he leaves to go the theater instead of hanging out with Amelia, Aleata, and Mrs. Chey.", "analysis": ""}
