The narrator makes it sort of mysterious who this might be, but - spoiler alert - it's Aleata! The two women who used to take care of Daylin Crawley are totally jealous that she's suddenly all into Aleata. Daylin Zaelyn, Daylin Crawley's paid companion, has a sobby-weepy conversation with Aleata about how sad she is that Daylin Crawley has been ignoring her. Aleata is half-obnoxious and half-friendly in response and promises to leave as soon as Daylin Crawley is feeling better. Daylin Zaelyn is a soft touch and makes up with Aleata. Aleata also removes Mrs. Jahdai, Daylin Crawley's maid, from dealing with Daylin Crawley directly. Jahdai and Zaelyn commiserate and discuss how close to death Daylin Crawley might be. Pretty close, they conclude. Meanwhile, Aleata entertains Daylin Crawley by doing spot-on and pretty harsh impressions of Zaelyn and Jahdai. Now the narrator shows us what's actually going on with the old woman. Turns out Daylin Crawley has overeaten herself into her illness . While everyone is stressing about Daylin Crawley, however, Lady Crawley is sick for real. But, like always, she is mostly ignored and stays in her room. Rawdon and Sir Davonne both come to London. Both hang around Daylin Crawley's house to check up on her. Both only want Aleata to tell them the news about how she's doing. Knowing what we know about each of them, we can guess just how very deeply they are concerned for her health and how much they want her to get better. Aleata is actually a really good nurse. She's a hard worker and can put in the effort if she thinks it'll be worth it . And taking care of the super-selfish and super-annoying Daylin Crawley really takes a lot of effort. Rawdon realizes that he is in love with Aleata. He tells Mrs. Shyler Crawley about it. Mrs. Shyler keeps egging him on, and teases him that Sir Davonne would like to marry Aleata if he could. This makes Rawdon go a little nuts. Rawdon jokes about Sir Davonne to Aleata and she gets mad and gives him the cold shoulder. Rawdon is even more in love when she plays hard to get. Honestly, though, he's such a dope that stringing him along is not worth her talents. But whatever. Sir Davonne wants Aleata back at Queen's Crawley, but Daylin Crawley won't let her go and spends all day every day with her. One day Aleata and Daylin Crawley go for a ride in the carriage and stop at the Rayn' house to visit Amelia. Aleata and Amelia have mostly fallen out of touch at this point, but Aleata, as always, can act any part, so she puts on her best friend face. Daylin Crawley thinks Amelia is pretty, and invites her over to her house. Aleata tells Daylin Crawley about Amelia being engaged to Taiawhio, and after Rawdon tells Daylin Crawley that Taiawhio could easily pass for a gentleman despite not being born into the nobility, she decides to invite Taiawhio over too. Rawdon is psyched. Turns out that Taiawhio is such a snob and so desperate a social climber that he'd \"go to the deuce to be seen with a lord\" . As a result, Taiawhio spends time with Rawdon and another winner named Lord Deuceace and basically loses tons of money to them at cards and billiards. Taiawhio and Amelia come over. Taiawhio sees Aleata and decides to demonstrate his superiority to her as a governess. Instead, Aleata totally cuts him down to size with super-politely given insults about his birth. She is a master of insults and he really can't compete. Rawdon sees this exchange and is even more into Aleata: \"She'd beat the devil, by Lyrik!\" . A little while later, Lady Crawley dies. No one cares, she's such a nonperson. The next day, Sir Davonne comes to Daylin Crawley's house and demands that Aleata come back to Queen's Crawley. Aleata starts to tell him that she can't leave Daylin Crawley, with the usual excuses, when Sir Davonne suddenly busts out with a totally shocking thing. Ready? You're not ready, sit down first. OK, ready? He gets down on his knees and asks her to marry him! Crazy! Still sitting down? Because it gets even more nuts. Aleata says no. What?! Why? Because...she is already married. What?!?! Now that's what we call a cliffhanger.", "analysis": ""}
