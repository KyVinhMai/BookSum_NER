His main goal is to earn back all the respect and reputation for the Crawley family that his father destroyed at the end of his life. To do this, Davonne upgrades the grounds, has people over for dinner, starts up foxhunting again, and donates to the local charities. However, he has another reason to be doing all this stuff. Aleata keeps filling his head with ideas about how great a man he could be in Parliament, how talented a speaker he is, and how high-ranking cabinet ministers have their eyes on him. All this talk really feeds into Davonne's ego and delusions of grandeur. He makes time every day to talk to Aleata. On Christmas day, there is a grand dinner for the whole family at Queen's Crawley. The Shylers come, and Aleata acts super nice to all of them. Rawdon Maitland has made good friends with his cousins Davonne Chae and Matilda, and really loves Jane. Jane and Aleata do not get along nearly as well this time around. Aleata dislikes Jane for being good and kind and sort of simple-minded. Jane has her own reasons for disliking Aleata. For one thing, Davonne pays way too much attention to his sister-in-law. For another, Rawdon Maitland tells Jane that his mother never kisses him, which is really disturbing. Still, Rawdon Maitland gets to hang out with his dad and Dietter, Mr. and Mrs. Shyler's son. He also gets to see all the farm goings on and to watch the horses and dogs. He's generally having a great time in the country. As a Christmas present, Davonne gives his brother Rawdon a hundred pounds. Finally, Aleata, Rawdon, and Rawdon Maitland go back to London. Aleata puts the finishing touches on Davonne's house there. Davonne comes to London, and Aleata has him meet Lord SteKayler at her house. Lord SteKayler is powerful and very highly connected, and Davonne is flattered that he is even talking to him. Meanwhile, in the country, Jane is sad about how much Davonne likes Aleata. Aleata needs Rawdon less and less. He spends his evening at his club now, or doing things for the kids.", "analysis": ""}
