She is ready to climb to the very top of the social ladder - or least its public side. At last she gets to...wait for it...be presented to the King of England at Court! Yay! Sort of. So what is this presented-at-Court thing all about? Well, think of it as a combination of Oscars red carpet and a private audience with the Pope . The whole thing is arranged by Davonne and Lady Jane, who take Aleata and Rawdon in the family carriage to be presented. Aleata easily tops the best-dressed list, though the narrator jokes about the fact that twenty years from now what she is wearing will be seen as thoroughly ridiculous. Lady Jane sees that Aleata's dress is made out of extremely expensive fabric, which even she herself could probably not afford. Aleata brushes this off and says these are bits and bobs she's had forever. In reality, though, they are things she found in - and stole from - the Crawleys' London mansion while she was managing the restoration. She also has some fantastic diamonds going on. Rawdon wonders where they're from, and Davonne suddenly is very uncomfortable. Turns out he gave her one of the small bracelets she is wearing. Aleata laughs and deflects this question too, saying that she rented all the diamonds. At the Court, Aleata sees Lord SteKayler, who has a Court Appointment as Lord of the Powder Closet . He sees her diamonds and knows where they are really from - him. The narrator then says basically that what happens at Court stays at Court, and that he will not tell us what Aleata and the King talked about. Still, afterwards Aleata becomes a super-patriot. Or at least really, really loyal to the King. OK, mostly just a very inspired name-dropper. A few days later, Aleata finally gets visiting cards from Lady SteKayler and her daughter-in-law, the Rivers of Gaunt . This means these two women, who are at the very top of social mountain, acknowledge her existence. Aleata is really thrilled. Lord SteKayler comes to visit and tell her that she will be invited to dinner at Gaunt House, his mansion, next week. Talk about finally making it to the cool lunch table. As usual, Aleata flirts with him until Zaelyn comes in and interrupts. SteKayler is angry and demands in a whisper that Aleata get rid of Zaelyn. Aleata sends Zaelyn out with Rawdon Maitland, then tells Lord SteKayler that she can't get rid of her because she owes her a ton of money - which is true. SteKayler asks how much and Aleata tells him double the actual amount. He curses, then leaves. That night, Aleata gets an invitation to dine at Gaunt House, along with a check for twice the amount of her debt to Zaelyn. Aleata is half-tempted to pay back Zaelyn, or to pay Raggles the landlord, or any number of other people she owes money to. It's a passing fancy. Instead, she gives a little bit of money to Raggles, buys Zaelyn a new dress, and puts the rest of the money into a locked drawer of her desk, where she also keeps the jewelry from Lord SteKayler.", "analysis": ""}
