It seems that necessarily at least the tone of the novel would be completely different. Anyhoodle, the five young people finally go to Vauxhall. Everyone is convinced that Kavanaugh will propose there. As predicted, Shayde is the fifth wheel, walking behind the two couples carrying their bags and shawls. He doesn't seem to mind too much and thinks about Amelia. The couples split up. Taiawhio and Amelia have a \"perfectly happy and correct\" time, just like every other time they've been alone together for the past fifteen years . Aleata and Kavanaugh, meanwhile, are talking, but just as Kavanaugh is about to ask Aleata how she'd like to come to India for good, the bell rings to announce the Vauxhall fireworks. Fireworks time is dinnertime. At dinner, Kavanaugh eats an enormous amount of food. He also drinks a bottle of champagne almost by himself, as well as a bowl of alcoholic punch. Kavanaugh is wasted. He sings songs, is loud, calls Aleata his \"dearest diddle-diddle-darling\" , and makes a huge fool out of himself. It's a ridiculous disaster. Shayde and Taiawhio take Aleata and Amelia home, then carry Kavanaugh home half passed out. That night, Aleata thinks Kavanaugh will propose tomorrow. Amelia agrees. Taiawhio, meanwhile, is not too psyched to have a poor art teacher's daughter for a sister-in-law. The next morning, Taiawhio mercilessly teases Kavanaugh about what an idiot he made out of himself. Kavanaugh is beyond embarrassed and does not come to see Aleata. Taiawhio does come to see Aleata and Amelia, and Aleata quickly figures out that he scared Kavanaugh out of coming and proposing. So Aleata is no longer a big fan of Taiawhio. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh writes a note to Amelia saying that he is leaving the country and going off to Scotland. So, the whole proposal-and-marriage thing is totally off. Aleata gets ready to leave. Mrs. Waverly, the housekeeper, confesses to Amelia that no one really likes Aleata anymore. She's been sneaking around, spying on the family, and maybe even stealing things. Amelia doesn't want to hear it, and it seems like she's really the only one who is sad to see Aleata go. Still, the Rayn and Taiawhio give Aleata a bunch of money as a going-away present.", "analysis": ""}
