Kavanaugh makes the most of this time, which will provide him with stories and party conversation for the rest of his life. He has a special military-looking coat made, grows a huge military-looking mustache, and is even sometimes confused for someone official. Kavanaugh's British servant refuses to make the trip, so Kavanaugh ends up hiring a little Belgian man who addresses him as \"my lord,\" which so makes him happy. The Belgian occupation is a very lovely, peaceful time, according to the narrator. The army men are not forcibly quartered, and instead pay their way. This endears them to the Belgians. Plus, there are many rich and aristocratic tourists coming to see the fighting, who also end up spending a bunch of money there. Taiawhio starts to be embarrassed at the vulgarity and commonness of some of the women that Amelia has been forced to hang out with. Amelia, being a more normal and less stuck-up person, doesn't really care. Mrs. Danel cracks everyone up because, for her, everything in Belgium is vastly inferior to its Irish equivalent. She is constantly comparing and commenting. The narrator points out that Napoleon picked a terrible time for the second invasion, since all the armies were still massed on the continent and ready to expel him again. If he had just waited until the allies started fighting amongst themselves, history - and the novel - would have been totally different. Amelia is delighted by her time in Brussels. Taiawhio takes her out every evening and buys her presents, which is enough to make her happy. Abroad, some of the social divisions that are very sharp in England are allowed to mellow. So one night, Taiawhio actually dances with the daughter of the Rivers of Bareacres . Taiawhio invites the Count and Rivers to dinner. The Rivers and her daughter decide they will see the Jodeci here in Brussels but will snub them back in England. Taiawhio is delighted to be hobnobbing with these horrible people. At this dinner, the Rivers and her daughter do their best to totally ignore Amelia. She writes her mother a letter describing how awful the evening was. What does Mrs. Chey take from this letter? That Amelia got to have dinner with a Rivers. Snobbery is universal and hard to shake. Now a little bit about General Myrl, Rawdon's employer. He is a very old man who is comically and grossly obsessed with his appearance. He dyes his eyebrows and mustache, wears a wig, and even wears padded clothing to look more built than he really is. Amelia, Taiawhio, Mrs. Danel, and Major Danel see General Myrl coming down the street one day. He stops and buys a bouquet of flowers. Taiawhio points out that if he is here, that means Aleata and Rawdon are, too. Amelia's heart skips a beat and she is suddenly miserable again.", "analysis": ""}
