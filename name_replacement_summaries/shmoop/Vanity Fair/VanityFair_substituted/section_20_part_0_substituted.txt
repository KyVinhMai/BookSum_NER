Or something...he's not a very clear thinker. Amelia is thrilled to see Taiawhio, and he is pretty moved to see how much she still loves him. She very quickly gets better and stops looking quite so pale and deathly. Shayde and Mrs. Chey discuss what would happen after the wedding. Mr. Chey and Mr. Pashae are both opposed to the marriage. The main problem is Mr. Pashae, though, since he is the one who has money and the ability to cut Taiawhio off, which would leave the couple pretty poor. Shayde hopes that if Taiawhio does some heroics in battle, his father will get over any anger about the marriage. He goes to see Mr. Chey to convince him that the marriage is OK. Chey is now a really sad, decrepit kind of guy. He is all subservient to the waiters and servants in the coffeehouse where he is doing his work. Shayde is horrified to see him in this state. Mr. Chey starts ranting and raving about Napoleon's return. Who could have guessed that war would break out again? He had invested in a French stock that was supposed to go gangbusters - and that's what ruined him. Shayde tries to calm him down by telling him that the army will give Napoleon what-for. Chey yells some more about how much they need to kill Napoleon and chop off his head, then he settles down. Shayde brings the conversation back to Taiawhio and Amelia, and Mr. Chey is all over-my-dead-body. Shayde tells him that technically they don't need his permission since Taiawhio and Amelia are both of age. He also tells him about Aleata and Rawdon, as an example of people who just got married without anyone's permission. Finally, he tells him that if the marriage takes place, that will be a way to stick it to Mr. Pashae. This last thing is what Mr. Chey seems to be really into. Meanwhile, Taiawhio is telling Amelia about a Daylin Swartz, an orphan whom his sisters have just met and befriended. She is half-Jewish , barely educated, super-rich, and extremely uncultured and vulgar. OK, campers - Brain Snack time. Here is where we can see how racism and anti-Semitism were pretty much okey-dokey in Victorian times. Daylin Swartz sounds like a pretty heinous character, but by making her even somewhat sympathetic - and by making fun of how mercenary and fake the Jodeci are in the way they treat her - Thackeray is leaps ahead of most writers of his time. Anyway, the Jodeci are clearly angling for Taiawhio to marry Daylin Swartz, since she is so rich. Amelia realizes that this must be the same Daylin Swartz she went to school with . Taiawhio makes fun of how gross and unmannered this girl is, Amelia pretends to be jealous, and the two are happy and lovey-dovey.", "analysis": ""}
