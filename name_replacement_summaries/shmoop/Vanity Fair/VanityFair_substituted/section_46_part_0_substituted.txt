Amelia scrimps and saves to try to dress Taiawhio Maitland in the kind of fancy clothes she thinks Taiawhio's son should be wearing. Taiawhio is old enough now to go to school, so Amelia sends him to Mr. Amari's school. He does well there, though she is sad to no longer be with him all day. If you haven't figured it out, Amelia lives only for Taiawhio Maitland She keeps all his papers and worksheets and knows everything about his classmates. Meanwhile, Maria Pashae grows more and more obnoxious and more and more estranged from her father - and his money. Jane Pashae thinks often about Taiawhio Maitland and wants to see him more. Sometimes she does at the Shaydes' house. Mr. Pashae starts to think seriously about Taiawhio Maitland too. One day, when Taiawhio Maitland comes back from the Shaydes', he tells Amelia that he saw an old man there with thick eyebrows and large chains. Amelia realizes this must have been Mr. Pashae, and she readies herself for what's coming next. She's right to be worried. Pashae sends her an offer proposing that she send Taiawhio Maitland to go live with him. In return, Taiawhio Maitland will inherit the Pashae money, but she will only be allowed to see him infrequently. Amelia flips out and orders the messenger who brought the offer out of the house. Her parents don't notice that she is going slightly crazy. They have their own issues. Mr. Chey, who keeps investing in failing ventures, is constantly losing money. Also, it seems that Kavanaugh has stopped paying the annual allowance that he had been sending to his parents. The cutting back is at first sort of annoying. Amelia tells Taiawhio Maitland that he can no longer get new clothes for Christmas, like she had been promising. He flips out, whines, and cries. Amelia feels terrible and goes to the pawn shop to sell her last nice thing - a shawl from India that Shayde sent her. With the money from that, she buys Taiawhio Maitland books and clothes and is happy. But when she gets home, Mrs. Chey sees all the new things and loses it. They have a big fight. Mrs. Chey accuses Amelia of spoiling Taiawhio Maitland and tells her they are completely bankrupt. The Rayn fall behind on their bills and start to eat so poorly that Amelia notices that Taiawhio Maitland is not getting enough food. She realizes that she might be being selfish in not giving him up to go live in wealth and comfort with Mr. Pashae. It's super sad, guys. It's OK if you need to take a few minutes.", "analysis": ""}
