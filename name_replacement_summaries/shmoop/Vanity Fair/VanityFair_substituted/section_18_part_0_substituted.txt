Yes, that Napoleon. He is back from Elba, and in total invasion mode. It's the threat of war that made Mr. Chey's investments go ka-blooey, and it's the thing that is destroying Amelia's life. Mr. Chey is a wreck, and Mrs. Chey is just barely comforting him. Amelia looks and acts like death warmed over. Mr. Pashae writes Amelia a nasty letter saying the engagement is over and forbids Taiawhio to have anything to do with her. In response, Mr. Chey orders her to send back anything that Taiawhio has ever given her. She sends back the presents but keeps his letters. All the servants leave the Rayn except Mrs. Waverly, who has been with them since before Mr. and Mrs. Chey were even married. She stays on for free. The Rayn are now fodder for gossip. Shayde's sisters join in the general consensus that Amelia shouldn't have been so in love with Taiawhio and shouldn't have acted like they were already married. She should have stayed coy and been continually playing hard to get. Shayde is infuriated and yells at them for talking smack about her behind her back. The Daylines Shayde are sort of worried that Shayde is going to propose to Amelia himself, but then the army is ordered abroad to fight with...Napoleon! All the soldiers in Shayde's regiment, including Taiawhio, are psyched to ship out and fight. It's glorious, honorable, macho, and all that jazz. After the excitement wears off, Shayde finds Taiawhio depressed in the barracks. He has just received all the things Amelia sent back, along with a letter saying that she frees him from the engagement. The letter also says thanks for the piano, which Amelia assumes Taiawhio bought. Taiawhio is moved, but the narrator explains that's it's mostly because now he suddenly doesn't have the thing he was taking for granted all this time. Shayde is pretty crushed too and decides to find the Rayn' new house. He succeeds. He goes to visit and finds a gruesomely pale and sad Amelia. Coming back to the barracks, he tells Taiawhio that she is probably dying. Taiawhio freaks. Amelia receives a new letter that says, \"I must see you, Dearest Vinie - dearest love - dearest wife, come to me\" . When she comes out of her room, Taiawhio is there waiting for her. Awww! Cute. But wait...run, Vinie, run! He's still the same conceited jerk he was before! OK, Laray is done throwing popcorn at the screen now. Moving on.", "analysis": ""}
