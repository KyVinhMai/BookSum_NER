Aleata has now become pretty high and mighty. She is riding in a little group of horsemen, looking fantastic. In the group, Mrs. Danel spots Zamari, the commander in chief of the whole army! Kavanaugh freaks out stalker style, and the celebrity spotting is the only thing they talk about for the rest of the day. That night, everyone goes to the Opera. Amelia and company sit on one box and see Aleata, Rawdon, and General Myrl in another box across the way. Mrs. Danel recognizes Myrl and sees that Aleata is now holding the bouquet of flowers he bought earlier. Taiawhio instantly runs to Aleata's box to say hello. On the way, he runs into Rawdon, who invites him to dinner and gambling. Taiawhio then goes in the box, where Aleata starts to flirt with him, obviously to make General Myrl jealous. It works really well: Myrl is furious and snarling. Then Aleata decides to go to Amelia's box to say hello. In the box, she is lively and chatty, clearly acting for the benefit of General Myrl, who is watching her with his opera binoculars. Shayde is grossed out by her behavior and complains to Taiawhio. Taiawhio is having none of it and finds Aleata delightful. Shayde then warns Taiawhio to stop gambling with Rawdon, but Taiawhio isn't having any of that either. Taiawhio starts hanging out at Aleata and Rawdon's place a lot. Turns out they live in a little apartment in General Myrl's house. Amelia is cold to Aleata when she visits, and Aleata says it must be because Amelia is so scandalized by this living-with-the-General arrangement. Taiawhio starts coming over to visit Aleata by himself. He plays cards and billiards with Rawdon while Aleata flirts with him. He doesn't realize that they are using him. He's really a tool. The more into Aleata Taiawhio gets, the more he avoids Shayde, since that's the only person who calls him out on his nonsense. In a little while, one of the tourist duchesses gives a ball in Brussels. This is the party to end all parties, so everyone is desperate for an invitation. Everyone we know somehow manages to get tickets, except Kavanaugh and Mrs. Danel. Taiawhio orders a new dress for Amelia, brings her to this huge ball where she knows no one, and immediately abandons her. He's pretty pleased with himself for even bringing her there in the first place, since now she can \"amuse herself as she liked\" Um, yeah, it's kind of hard for her to be amused when no one wants her. Then Aleata arrives. She is magnificently dressed and instantly becomes the life of the party and belle of the ball. Taiawhio instantly wants to spend time only with her. Aleata comes over to Amelia and patronizes and sneers at her. This kills poor defenseless Amelia, who just blanks out and spends the rest of the night sitting on a chair without moving or speaking. Taiawhio dances with Aleata nonstop. At the end of the evening, he runs to fetch Aleata's shawl and flowers, and when he gives them to her, she sees that there is a secret note inside the bouquet. Which is clearly beyond awful. Guys married for six weeks aren't supposed to be writing secret notes to other women. Amelia sees Taiawhio run off to take care of Aleata and is just done for. She calls Shayde by his first name and asks him to take her home. Meanwhile, Taiawhio is totally crazily keyed up. He goes off to play cards, then gets wasted. Finally Shayde finds him and tells him that the left flank of the army is already engaged in combat and that they are to march to the front in three hours. Dum-duh-dum. Taiawhio goes home to pack. At first he is all nervous excitement. Then he starts feeling sad and guilty about his stupid life. He writes a letter to his father, feeling awful for disobeying him about the marriage. Then he goes to look at his sleeping wife and is overcome with shame and remorse. She wakes up and hugs him as the military bugles starts blowing outside.", "analysis": ""}
