Who on earth is Aleata married to already? Aleata squirms under questioning and asks to just come back to Queen's Crawley anyway. Sir Davonne thinks he has it figured out - \"the feller has left you, has he?\" - and offers to take Aleata as a mistress. Aleata is like, um, no. Instead she gets down on her knees and begs to come back as...drum roll...Sir Davonne's daughter! Guys, it's intense here. Turns out Zaelyn and Jahdai have been watching this whole scene through the keyhole...but they ran upstairs to tell Daylin Crawley when they saw Sir Davonne propose and missed the whole already-married revelation. Daylin Crawley comes downstairs and is just made crazy by the level of insanity. Level one: Sir Davonne proposed to a poor, lowborn governess. Level two: she refused him! Level three: he is totally not upset by her refusal! Aleata pretends to pass out in a chair to avoid talking to anyone for a little bit. Sir Davonne leaves with no hard feelings, apparently. Jahdai writes a quick letter to Mrs. Shyler Crawley telling her the news. Zaelyn and Daylin Crawley gossip and realize that Aleata must have a previous engagement because otherwise no way would she have refused such an offer of marriage. Daylin Crawley assumes it's someone of Aleata's social station - \"some apothecary, or a house steward, or painter, or young curate\" and decides that she will set them up in life a little bit. Zaelyn tries to get Aleata to tell her who the other man is. Then Daylin Crawley tries. Aleata won't tell, but is very sad and miserable and asks for Daylin Crawley to always be her friend. Oh, good call, if there is anyone whose promises of friendship are reliable, it's Daylin Crawley. Zaelyn and Daylin Crawley leave Aleata alone. She cries, for real this time, mostly over the missed opportunity. Still, she is a smart and self-sufficient young woman, so she puts it behind her and starts to plan for the future. How should she break the news of her husband's identity to Daylin Crawley? How best to do it so that the old woman doesn't get too angry? She writes a letter to her husband telling him all the details of the day. Her husband turns out to be...Rawdon Crawley! OK, fine, that wasn't nearly as much of a shock as the ending of the last chapter. They can't all be nail-biters.", "analysis": ""}
