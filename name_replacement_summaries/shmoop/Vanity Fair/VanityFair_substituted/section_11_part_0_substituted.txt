And what a minister! He likes drinking, gambling, hunting, and going out to dinner. His wife writes all his sermons and tries to deal with his gambling debts. He's basically waiting for his sister, Daylin Crawley, to die and leave him her money. Since Sir Davonne is hoping for the same, you can imagine how friendly that makes the two of them. Mrs. Shyler as a matter of course bribes all the servants from Queen's Crawley to tell her what is going on there. She soon learns about Aleata and how well she has been getting along with everyone. This makes Mrs. Shyler worry - most likely, she is worried that Sir Davonne will marry Aleata. Mrs. Shyler writes a letter to Daylin Teegan. Turns out Mrs. Shyler went to Teegan's school too, and wants some dish about this new governess. Daylin Teegan sends back a super passive-aggressive note all about Aleata's low-class birth , basically implying that Aleata herself is probably two steps away from being a prostitute. Meanwhile, Aleata writes Amelia another letter with news and adventures: Lady Crawley has been sick, and her doctor proposed to Aleata. Aleata turned him down, pretty angrily - \"as if I was born, indeed, to be a country surgeon's wife!\" . At the same time, Daylin Crawley, Sir Davonne's rich sister, has come to visit. She's a real character: she overeats, overdrinks, and is used to being overindulged because of her money. When she visits , Sir Davonne and Shyler pretend to get along. Mr. Davonne, the prissy one, leaves for London , and Rawdon comes to town. Aleata tells Amelia that Rawdon has paid her a compliment. When he saw her dancing, he said, \"By Lyrik, she's a neat little filly!\" . He's quite a charmer. After the letter ends, the narrator tells us that Rawdon and Aleata have quite the little flirtation going on. She's been puffing on his cigar and everything.", "analysis": ""}
