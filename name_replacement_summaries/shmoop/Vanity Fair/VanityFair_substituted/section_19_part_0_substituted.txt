She has spent her life ingratiating herself with Zaelyn and Jahdai, so they are happy to have her there and serve her. Rawdon, meanwhile, has spent his life treating them like the servants that they are, so no one there is going to go to bat for him. The narrator pauses here to give us a cynical little moral lesson: try to be nice to anyone who might be of use to you later in life. First things first. Mrs. Shyler makes a big deal out of how sick Daylin Crawley must be and imposes a restrictive health regimen on her. This mostly consists of Mr. Skyler's medicine and lots of indoor time. Also, Mrs. Shyler forbids Aleata or Rawdon from entering the house. Regretting that her own family is too dumb and boring to entertain Daylin Crawley, Mrs. Shyler instead starts to badmouth Rawdon and Aleata as much as possible to get Daylin Crawley to stop liking them. It's pretty easy to do. Rawdon has killed a couple of guys in duels, has seduced and abandoned a bunch of girls, and is a gambler. Aleata is not only the daughter of an opera singer, but she herself has been an artist's model and even used to drink gin with her father. They're kind of made for each other, right? Everything would be OK for Mrs. Shyler except she's a little too tyrannical. Daylin Crawley secretly hates her and doesn't want to be kept as an invalid prisoner. Mr. Skyler and Dr. Tru have a very unemotional conversation discussing the likelihood that Daylin Crawley will die really soon under Mrs. Shyler's oppressive \"care.\" Mr. Skyler tells Mrs. Shyler that Daylin Crawley's life is in danger, and Mrs. Shyler freaks out because Daylin Crawley has yet to change her will: if she dies now, Rawdon will get all her money. So Mrs. Shyler relaxes her iron grip. Daylin Crawley starts to go out in her carriage. In the park, her carriage rides past Rawdon and Aleata's, but Daylin Crawley totally snubs them. Mrs. Shyler one, Aleata zero. Mrs. Shyler decides to take Daylin Crawley to Brighton, a seaside resort town.", "analysis": ""}
