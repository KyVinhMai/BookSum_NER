It's not really clear why Kavanaugh is coming with them, but whatever. Shayde is already there. In the inn Amelia finds a letter addressed to herself, and Taiawhio recognizes the handwriting of Jeselle Danel, the wife of the regiment's major. The letter is an invitation to dinner that night, but Mrs. Danel can't wait and bursts into the room five minutes later. Jeselle is one of the novel's comic-relief characters. Or at least she starts out that way. She is Irish - clearly, from her name - and her Irish accent is written out . She is loud, a little vulgar, and generally convinced that her noble Irish family is very famous and that Ireland is the world's best country. Still, the narrator doesn't dislike her, so her ego doesn't come off as nearly as unpleasant as Taiawhio's - she's funny rather than jerky. Jeselle instantly tells Amelia her whole life story. She was one of eleven children, descended from the Malonys of Glenmalony and Ballymalony and related to Lord Hadyn . When she was 33, she asked her cousin Jusitn Danel to ask her to marry him, which he did. Major Jusitn Danel is a very pleasant, quiet, agreeable, unassuming man, who clearly loves his wife and does whatever she says. At the same time, he is an extremely brave soldier who has earned his rank through heroics in combat and daring war strategy. Jeselle then goes on to tell Amelia all about everyone else in the regiment and welcomes her to the big army family. Amelia is happy at this reception, and at dinner that night she is pretty and popular with the soldiers, and even Taiawhio seems more attentive and nicer to her than usual. Shayde is at the dinner too and silently watches her, then goes outside to smoke a cigar and think.", "analysis": ""}
