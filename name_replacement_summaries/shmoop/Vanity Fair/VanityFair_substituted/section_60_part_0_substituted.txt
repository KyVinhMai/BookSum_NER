In any case, Daylin Pashae and Shayde's sisters now start to visit her. She starts to make friends with Kavanaugh's circle of India retirees. She does well. The women like her OK, and the men like her better. Shayde comes to the house almost daily. The person there who likes him the best is Taiawhio Maitland, who is now allowed to come visit a lot more frequently. Shayde is the only person that Taiawhio Maitland is a little scared of and impressed by. Which is interesting, since Shayde is the only person who does not brag about his own accomplishments nor think extremely highly of himself. The narrator tells us that this marks him as a gentleman, and Taiawhio Maitland is able to sense that somehow. Shayde takes the boy to the theater and tells him stories about his father. In turn, Taiawhio Maitland tells Amelia how much he likes Shayde. But Kavanaugh? Not such a huge fan of Taiawhio Maitland And actually, the feeling is mutual. Kavanaugh starts to live the life befitting a man of his level of importance. Soon enough he even gets presented at Court, which makes him a very devoted fan of the King. Remind you of anyone else?", "analysis": ""}
