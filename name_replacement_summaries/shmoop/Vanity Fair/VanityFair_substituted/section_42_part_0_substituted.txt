Mr. Pashae is more and more growly and miserable than ever. He proposed to Daylin Swartz, the mixed-race rich girl he had been trying to get Taiawhio to marry, but was rejected by her and her minders out of hand. Maria was finally married to Trenton Jamile. Jane is a spinster and lives in total depression, loneliness, and misery with her horrible father. The Jamile family is connected with the aristocracy, so to make up for her own lower social rank, Maria starts to ignore and avoid her father and sister. She never has them over when she has her A-list parties, and sadly is too stupid and too bad of an actress not to let them know. Shayde's sisters sometimes visit Jane Pashae, just as they do Amelia. They've been telling Jane all about Taiawhio Maitland and how adorable and wonderful he is. One day, after Taiawhio Maitland goes to spend a day with Shayde's sisters at their estate, Amelia writes a letter to Shayde, congratulating him on his upcoming marriage. There is a lot of sarcasm from the narrator here about just how happy Amelia is about the idea of Shayde getting married. Taiawhio Maitland comes home with a gold chain and tells Amelia that an old, unattractive lady gave it to him. Amelia's heart skips a beat because she realizes this must have been Jane Pashae. When Mr. Pashae comes home that night he sees that Jane is really out of it. When he asks her what's wrong, she tells him that she has seen little Taiawhio Maitland and that he is the spitting image of his father. Mr. Pashae doesn't say anything but starts to tremble", "analysis": ""}
