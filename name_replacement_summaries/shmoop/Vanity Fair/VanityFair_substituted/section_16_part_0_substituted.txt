How could Aleata and Rawdon have gotten married? Easy enough - they are both of age, so they slipped off and just did it one day. It might not have been Rawdon's best decision, but probably his most honorable. After all, isn't that what men are supposed to do - meet a girl, fall in love, then make it legal? Rawdon is happy to leave all the details of their future in his wife's hands. He is at least smart enough to realize that she has a much better head on her shoulders than he does. While Aleata is dealing with things, Rawdon rents an apartment for the two of them in a middle-class London neighborhood. That night Aleata is playing it to the hilt. She sings, tells stories, plays cards - everything possible to make Daylin Crawley happy. The narrator drops in to let us know that if Rawdon had been there that night, and if he and Aleata had confessed, Daylin Crawley would have instantly forgiven them. But then we'd have no novel. As it is, the next morning, a maid named Betty Martin finds a note addressed to Zaelyn on Aleata's bed, which has clearly not been slept in. Aleata's letter tells Zaelyn that Rawdon is her husband, and that Aleata has gone to be with him. Right at that moment, Mrs. Shyler comes to Daylin Crawley's house . Zaelyn tells Mrs. Shyler the news, and together they very slowly, suspensefully, with as much freaking out as possible, tell Daylin Crawley. She totally loses it. Sir Davonne then comes to the house to pick Aleata up and take her back to Queen's Crawley. Zaelyn tells him that she is married to Rawdon and he really flips out. He is beyond jealous of his son , storms back home, and trashes her room and all her stuff.", "analysis": ""}
