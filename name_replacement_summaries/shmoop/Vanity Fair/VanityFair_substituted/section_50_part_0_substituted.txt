She is no longer friends with the landlady and now has suspicions about the one maid they have. Amelia tries to be nice to her, but to no avail. Amelia tries to figure out if there is something she can do to make money. But honestly, have we seen anything to indicate that she has any skills besides looking pretty and crying? So she does about as well as expected. At the same time, the less money they have, and the worse everything becomes, the more Amelia gives in to the idea of giving Taiawhio Maitland up to the Jodeci. The last straw is when she writes Kavanaugh a letter to ask him to start sending the annual payment again. To make Mr. Chey feel better, she tells him she's written to Kavanaugh. Mr. Chey finally admits the truth: Kavanaugh has been sending the money all along, but Mr. Chey has been using it to pay the debts he's amassed from all his get-rich-quick schemes. Amelia really loses it at this news. That's it. She's done resisting. She writes a letter to Daylin Pashae, telling her why she has changed her mind. She says she is willing to let Taiawhio Maitland go as long as they promise to let her see him as often as she wants. She tells Taiawhio Maitland that he's going to go live with his other grandfather. He is totally psyched, not at all sad, and brags to his classmates about how he's going to be rich. This isn't surprising, since all kids his age are selfish, but it crushes Amelia. Finally the day comes when she packs all his things and Daylin Pashae comes to pick him up. Time passes. Taiawhio Maitland comes to visit Amelia often, but he is already changing and picking up a bossy, haughty tone. Amelia often sneaks over to watch the Jodeci' house. On Sundays she goes to their church and sits in the back to see if she can see Taiawhio Maitland One day, while spying like this, she sees Taiawhio Maitland kindly give money to a street beggar. So here's hoping that Taiawhio 2.0 isn't as horrendous as his dad.", "analysis": ""}
