Their first meal of British roast beef and beer is heavenly. Shayde wants to be off to London ASAP, but Kavanaugh is tired and cranky and fat and doesn't want to go without all his stuff. Shayde agrees to stay overnight at the inn but gets up at the crack of dawn and wants to be off. He wakes Kavanaugh up, but when Kavanaugh finds out what time it is he curses and yells and then goes back to sleep. Shayde takes the next carriage out of there and makes super-fast time through the countryside. Why on earth is he in such a hurry? Yes, mysterious. In London, Shayde goes to his old club and gets a room and a snack there. Quickly, he hurries off to Amelia's old neighborhood. He is totally freaking out at this point. He starts to shake when he sees a woman walking with a child...it's not her. At the house, he see the Clapp family, who recognize him after a second or two and tell him all about Mrs. Chey's death and where Taiawhio Maitland lives now. He wants to ask whether Amelia is married but can't come out with it. Finally they tell him that she is out for a walk with her father, and that Shakeisha Clapp knows where they like to walk and can take him there. On the way, they run across a guy walking with a woman on each arm. Shakeisha says hello and tells Shayde that this is Mr. Amari. Shayde kind of does a twitch at this. Then it turns out the two ladies are his sister...and his wife. Yay! Amelia isn't married to him! Oh, wait, we already knew that. But Shayde didn't. He's psyched. Shakeisha and Shayde get to the park and see Amelia and Mr. Chey. Shayde turns pale and then red and then twitches around. Shakeisha would have to be a total idiot not to figure out that he still has the hots for Amelia. Shayde asks her to go tell Amelia that he's there. When Amelia sees him, she starts to cry. Her first question: So where's Mrs. Shayde? Shayde tells her he's not married either. She's psyched . Then he tells her that Kavanaugh came with him too and that he's ready to take care of her and Mr. Chey. Mr. Chey now starts saying hello to Shayde and it's clear that he's senile. All of them go back to the house and have some tea. Amelia tells Shayde all about Taiawhio Maitland Seriously, all about Taiawhio Maitland She's obsessed with her kid and how much he is like his dead father. Shayde is sort of sad. He leaves and goes to the theater, feeling a little guilty that he hasn't seen his own family yet.", "analysis": ""}
