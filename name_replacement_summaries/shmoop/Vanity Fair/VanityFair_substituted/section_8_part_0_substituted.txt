On the way to this big estate, Sir Davonne talks to one of his groundskeepers about the various tenants on his land , various ongoing lawsuits, and the general upkeep of a large country estate. Aleata learns that Sir Davonne has a younger brother, Shyler Crawley, who is the local parson. At night, Sir Davonne enforces a strict lights-out policy and takes away Aleata's candle to save money. His cheapness is made funnier by the fact that the mansion on the estate is enormous, with twenty bedrooms. Turns out the Crawley family is complex. Sir Davonne is on his second marriage. He has two sons from his first: Mr. Davonne Crawley , and a dragoon whom we have not yet met. He also has two daughters from his second marriage. These are the girls Aleata will be teaching; they are eight and ten years old. At dinner there is a minor scuffle as Mr. Crawley insists on calling all the sad, poor food by its French names for the sake of fanciness and propriety, and his father speaks in his Hampshire accent just to provoke him. Mr. Crawley is kind of a priss. Meanwhile, Lady Crawley is a sickly, sad woman, whom Sir Davonne clearly only married for her looks, which are now gone. Aleata instantly sees that Lady Crawley has no power or authority in the house and disregards her. The two Daylines Crawley - Aleata's students - are almost totally wild and uncivilized, since no one cares enough to deal with them. They mostly like to run around outside and climb on things. Here the letter ends. The narrator makes a little warning. Aleata seems amusing and likeable now, but don't get too attached. There's going to be some drama, some crimes, and some horrendous behavior later.", "analysis": ""}
