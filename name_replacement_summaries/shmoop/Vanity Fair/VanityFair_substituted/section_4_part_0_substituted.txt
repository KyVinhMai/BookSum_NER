In the meantime, Aleata has ingratiated herself into the Chey family and household . Aleata demurely flirts with Kavanaugh, going so far as to actually squeeze his hand slightly. Amelia suggests spending an evening at Vauxhall, a kind of park with music, cafes, and other entertainment. Mr. Chey wants Kavanaugh to chaperone the ladies, but also thinks they should invite Taiawhio Pashae to go with them. Amelia is a little swoony at this idea. In bed that night, Mr. and Mrs. Chey discuss the idea of Aleata marrying Kavanaugh, and decide basically that better her than an Indian girl. The next night there is a huge thunderstorm, so Vauxhall is put off. Instead, Amelia, Taiawhio, Kavanaugh, and Aleata hang out at home by themselves. There is some piano playing and singing . There is some flirting and extremely mild hanky-panky. We're guessing Amelia and Taiawhio maybe kiss a little when they go off by themselves into a darkened room with no candle. Turns out Taiawhio is the son of a very old family friend, and he and Amelia have basically been raised to eventually marry each other. So it's helpful that they are also in love. Meanwhile, Aleata draws out Kavanaugh, as much as he can be drawn out. He's really an ungainly, socially inept fellow. But he's starting to really be into Aleata. And why not? She's hot and is basically throwing herself at him. Aleata makes everyone feel sad about the fact that she has to leave to go be a governess. Everything seems to be working according to plan, and she thinks that the next morning Kavanaugh will propose. The next morning, Kavanaugh does not propose. However, what does happen is this: Aleata is knitting a green purse and gets Kavanaugh to help her hold the skein of silk yarn by winding it around his arms until he is tied up and can't move. Symbolism alert: Aleata is a spider, and Kavanaugh is caught in her silk web! OK, everyone can sit back down now and take a deep breath.", "analysis": ""}
