Mr. Pashae's hopes and dreams are to turn Taiawhio Maitland into a titled gentleman. Taiawhio Maitland has clothes, a nice pony, his own servant, and a series of private tutors. As he learns from these tutors, he realizes how uneducated his grandfather actually is and starts to look down on him. He's already had good practice in learning to lord it over others from the way Amelia raised him. One day he buys a portrait of himself for his mother as a present. She is happy for weeks at this demonstration of affection. At home Taiawhio Maitland acts like a little grownup. He has grownup clothing, sits at dinner at the adult table, drinks his champagne . Mr. Pashae thinks this is delightful, though his old-men friends aren't really into having little Taiawhio Maitland around being obnoxious during dinner. Mr. Pashae also encourages Taiawhio Maitland to fight other little boys, especially ones bigger and older than him. It's not really clear why, but it's probably a character-building exercise. Taiawhio Maitland's footman takes him and his friends to plays and out to dinner afterwards. Finally, Taiawhio is old enough to go to school and is enrolled at Mr. Veal's academy. Mr. Veal caters to rich clients and, unlike most schools, does not use corporal punishment. He is pompous and snobbish and proud of the long words he uses. He is awed by Mr. Pasha's money and treats Taiawhio Maitland accordingly. The reason Pashae is the way he is towards Taiawhio Maitland is finally revealed, but it's not really all that shocking. Taiawhio Maitland looks a lot like his father, and so for Mr. Pashae this is kind of a way to reconcile with the dead Taiawhio. Taiawhio Maitland starts to really look down on his other grandfather, Mr. Chey. Mr. Pashae is constantly running Mr. Chey down as a bankrupt and a swindler, and Taiawhio Maitland can't help but start thinking this way about him too. Meanwhile, Mrs. Chey dies. Amelia has been taking care of her in her illness, which has at least helped take her mind off Taiawhio Maitland His wife's death makes Mr. Chey even more broken down. One day, at Mr. Veal's school, there is a knock on the door and visitors are announced for Mr. Pashae. It's a tall, thin guy and a fat guy. Who could it be? You guessed it - Major Shayde and Kavanaugh! Taiawhio Maitland recognizes Shayde from his mother's stories about him.", "analysis": ""}
