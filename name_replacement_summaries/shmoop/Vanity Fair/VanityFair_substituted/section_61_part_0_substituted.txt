Clearly he's about to die. Amelia takes care of him during his final days, and Mr. Chey loves her more and more for it. Finally he apologizes for how he and her mother were angry with her over her excessive devotion to Taiawhio Maitland Aw, folks - closure. The narrator talks a bit about how a good death is quiet, calm, resigned, and reconciled. Mr. Chey dies. Mr. Pashae is one of the few people who even remembers who Mr. Chey was, and his death really affects him. Also, he figures out two things: 1) Shayde has a really impressive military career, even though he is modest and doesn't really talk about it; and 2) Amelia and her family were basically supported almost solely by Shayde while Mr. Pashae refused to acknowledge their existence. Mr. Pashae is floored by this discovery. He makes up with Shayde and invites him to dinner a few times. Then Mr. Pashae leaves his card with Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh comes over to dinner at the Pashae mansion a few times. Seems like a slow reconciliation is in progress. But, it's not to be. Remember how the title says that two lights are going to be put out? Chey was one. You can probably guess who number two will be. Yes, that's right. Just before he can make up with Amelia, Mr. Pashae has a stroke or something - some kind of medical issue where he can't talk but lives for a few more days. Finally he dies. It turns out that Jodeci changed his will again just before he died. He leaves half of his property to Taiawhio Maitland and the other half is split between the two Pashae sisters. Wow, crazy, since originally Taiawhio was written out of the will entirely. Also he leaves Amelia 500 pounds a year, which is a pretty amazing fortune , and enough to Shayde to buy him his next rank, Colonel. Amelia is happy to hear that Mr. Pashae apparently forgave her and dead Taiawhio before he died, and she in turn forgives him too. She and Taiawhio Maitland go to visit the old Pashae mansion before it's taken apart and sold. As soon as everyone learns how much Amelia now has, they start being nice to her again. Suddenly old friends come out of the woodwork to visit her. But she's bored to pieces with the company of Kavanaugh's friends and Mrs. Trentonerick Jamile's friends. So a trip abroad is proposed!", "analysis": ""}
