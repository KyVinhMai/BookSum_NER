Taiawhio used to mock him mercilessly. He is getting ready for breakfast, but Amelia is too ill to come out of her room and join him. Instead he talks to his servant Tundiram, who periodically goes into town to try to get whatever news he can about the war. Right now the news is basically that Napoleon is kicking butt and taking names. According to Tundiram, the Duke of Zamari is about to flee the country. Kavanaugh doesn't really believe it but is a little nervous about the reports. Tundiram, meanwhile, is really pro-Napoleon. Not least because if the English are chased out of Belgium or imprisoned or whatever, then all the belongings of the Jodeci and of Kavanaugh will go to him. As he gets Kavanaugh ready every morning, he mentally tabulates every item and figures out how he will use it. It's a funny moment and also, reminds the reader of Aleata and Rawdon's somewhat similar list-making in the last chapter. When Kavanaugh is putting on his military-style coat, Aleata walks in. At first she makes fun of Kavanaugh for looking like he wants to join the army. Then she starts to flirt with him. She basically tells him that she still has feelings for him, and that Rawdon is very jealous of him. It's really easy as pie, and Kavanaugh instantly has the hots for her again. Meanwhile, Aleata thinks that by doing this, she has found herself a good seat in Kavanaugh's carriage should the British need to flee Brussels. Kavanaugh obviously doesn't get that he's being used. Aleata then goes in to see Amelia. For the first time in her life, Amelia sort of stands up for herself and lets Aleata have it. She tells Aleata that she has been a good friend to her and asks why Aleata felt the need to take Taiawhio away from her even though they've only been married for six weeks. Aleata actually genuinely starts to feel bad, although she is also proud to be on the receiving end of this, since Amelia is basically conceding defeat. Then Amelia starts ranting and raving, and her conversation veers towards crazy. Aleata starts to actually worry about Amelia, goes out, and finds Mrs. Danel. Mrs. Danel is huffy that Aleata is talking to her, but Aleata just tells her to go deal with Amelia, since she is clearly not doing well. Mrs. Danel does succeed in making Amelia pull it together somewhat. She then goes to have lunch with Kavanaugh, when all of a sudden there is a loud noise outside...gunfire and the sounds of cannon!", "analysis": ""}
