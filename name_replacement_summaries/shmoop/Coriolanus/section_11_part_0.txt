On the one hand, he's a \"brave\" war hero. On the other hand, he's way too proud and hates the \"common people.\" One of the Officers points out that plenty of politicians hate the commoners but they're good at flattering voters. The only difference is that Coriolanus refuses to pander. The Senators show up and get down to business. It's official: Coriolanus is running for \"consul.\" Cominius gets up and gives a big speech. Mostly, he fanboys about Coriolanus' bravery in battle. Coriolanus is so embarrassed that he leaves the room, but the Senators can't get enough and say they want to make him consul. Next step is for Coriolanus to get the plebes' votes. This involves wearing a special toga, getting \"naked,\" and showing the people his war wounds. Hey, it's tradition. Coriolanus is not happy about this, but he promises the Senate he'll do it anyway. Everyone exits except Sicinius and Brutus. After talking more smack about Coriolanus, they decide to bad mouth him to the Citizens.", "analysis": ""}
