Sicinius and Brutus both decide that now that they have successfully booted Coriolanus out of Rome, they should pretend to be \"humbler\" so people won't get mad at them. Speaking of angry people, Volumnia and Virgilia show up. Since Sicinius and Brutus don't want to tangle with Coriolanus' mom, they try to high tail it out of there. Too late. Volumnia spots them and says, basically, \"Oh, hey guys. I hope you both die a horrible death!\" Sicinius is all \"Gee, that's not a very ladylike thing to say.\" Clever insults are traded. Volumnia proceeds to chew out the tribunes, who blow her off by suggesting that she's crazy. They leave.", "analysis": ""}
