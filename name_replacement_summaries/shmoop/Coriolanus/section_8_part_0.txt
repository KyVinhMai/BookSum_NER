Caius Martius is super embarrassed by all the attention and refuses to take his share of the war spoils. This, of course, makes him an even bigger rock-star. While the crowd of soldiers cheers him on, Martius gives a modest little victory speech about how he was just doing his military duty. Cominius declares that Caius Martius is so getting a new nickname name for his service to Rome. From here on out, he'll be called \"Caius Martius Coriolanus.\" You know, after the city he just destroyed. Next, Caius Martius Coriolanus says he really wants to help out a Volscian guy who was nice to him during his stay in Corioles. The only problem is, he can't remember the dude's name. Then he's all, \"Oops! Oh, well\" and runs off to wash all the sticky blood from his face.", "analysis": ""}
