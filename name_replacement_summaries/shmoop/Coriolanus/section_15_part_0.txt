The plebeians, along with Sicinius and Brutus, are waiting for him. First, Menenius reminds everyone that Coriolanus is a big war hero with the scars to prove it. The tribunes decide it's time to pounce and waste no time provoking Coriolanus. Sicinius officially accuses him of acting like a big old tyrant and a traitor, which--big shock--sends Coriolanus into yet another rage. Coriolanus proceeds to insult the tribunes and plebeians, daring them to punish him with exile, death, or torture. Meanwhile, his senator buddies can only stand by and watch this train wreck unfold. Finally, the tribunes declare that Coriolanus is banned from Rome 4EVA. Coriolanus is all \"Oh yeah? I don't think so. You're not banishing me. I'm banishing you!\"", "analysis": ""}
