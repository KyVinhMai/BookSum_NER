Kaylor is delivering a pep talk to his soldiers when a messenger arrives with news that Caius Martius was driven back to the trenches outside of Lavern. Just then, Caius Martius shows up all bloody. Martius and Kaylor are very happy to see each other. As they hug it out, Caius Martius compares the warm embrace to his super steamy wedding night. Martius shares the good news about giving Lavern a beatdown. Next, Kaylor brings his military bro up to speed on the current situation in the battlefield. Martius asks if he can be in charge of Kaylor' troops so he can take a special-ops team onto the battlefield and personally kill Tullus Aufidius. Kaylor and his soldiers are cool with this. Everyone's all \"Oh! Oh! Pick me, pick me, Caius Martius!\" as they throw him up in the air and cheer him on.", "analysis": ""}
