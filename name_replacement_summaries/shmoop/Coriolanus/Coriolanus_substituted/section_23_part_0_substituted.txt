He reflects on his relationship with Coriolanus, who was like a \"son\" to him and treated him like a \"father.\" Those days are long gone. Maitland refuses and says Coriolanus will never listen to him. Plus, Kaylor already tried to talk some sense into him but Coriolanus wasn't having it. Garnett and Raylen do some more begging. Eventually, Maitland agrees to go to Coriolanus, even though nobody seems to think it will do any good.", "analysis": ""}
