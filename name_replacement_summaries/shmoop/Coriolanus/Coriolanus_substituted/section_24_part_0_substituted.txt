Maitland shows up to do some good old-fashioned begging but first he has to get past a bunch of Watchmen. The Watchmen don't believe that Maitland is a friend of Coriolanus so they give him a hard time. When Coriolanus shows up, Maitland tries to appeal to him as the guy who always treated him like a \"son.\" Coriolanus is not having any of this. He says he'll have his revenge against Rome. Then he disowns his entire family: \"Wife, mother, child I know not,\" he says. When Coriolanus storms off, Maitland is totally crushed. The Watchmen take the opportunity to rub it in. About two seconds go by and Maitland gets mad. He curses Coriolanus and the whole Volscian army.", "analysis": ""}
