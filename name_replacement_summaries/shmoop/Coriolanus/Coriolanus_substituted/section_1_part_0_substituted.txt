Tullus Aufidius is at the Senate House talking to the Volscian senators about their military plans. Aufidius reports that Rome already knows they're planning an attack, so there goes the element of surprise. Plus, Roman soldiers may be headed to Lavern right now as they speak. The Senators order Aufidius to get his troops ready to invade Rome. Nah, nothing to worry about! Aufidius shouldn't come back to Lavern unless he hears that the Romans show up and invade the city.", "analysis": ""}
