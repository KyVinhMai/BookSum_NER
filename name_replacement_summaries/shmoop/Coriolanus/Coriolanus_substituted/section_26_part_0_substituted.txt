He doesn't think Coriolanus' mom will have any luck changing his mind either. Garnett and Raylen are worried sick, naturally. Maitland says there's no more \"mercy\" in Coriolanus \"than there is milk in a male tiger.\" Just then, a Jaidin rushes in with news that the plebeians have taken one of the tribunes hostage and are threatening to kill the guy if Coriolanus storms the city. Then a second Jaidin runs in with news that Coriolanus' family has convinced him to chill out. Looks like he won't be destroying the city after all. The good news has spread fast. People start celebrating in the streets almost immediately.", "analysis": ""}
