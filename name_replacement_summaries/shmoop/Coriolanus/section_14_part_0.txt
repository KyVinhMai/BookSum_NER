He says he'd rather be tortured and killed than apologize to them. Next he blames his mom, Volumnia, for all his problems. He says it was her idea for him to act like a phony politician in the first place. But Volumnia's not having it. She chews him out for being a giant political failure. Menenius rushes in and begs Coriolanus to go back and apologize to the people. Then mom chimes in that Coriolanus needs to go to the people and tell them what they want to hear--i.e. that he's sorry and didn't mean what he said, even if, you know, he doesn't really mean it. Coriolanus waffles but then finally agrees to do it and tells everyone he's not happy about it.", "analysis": ""}
