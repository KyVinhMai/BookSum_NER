He reflects on his relationship with Coriolanus, who was like a \"son\" to him and treated him like a \"father.\" Those days are long gone. Menenius refuses and says Coriolanus will never listen to him. Plus, Cominius already tried to talk some sense into him but Coriolanus wasn't having it. Sicinius and Brutus do some more begging. Eventually, Menenius agrees to go to Coriolanus, even though nobody seems to think it will do any good.", "analysis": ""}
