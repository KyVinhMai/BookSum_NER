As previously mentioned, the shot must be fired from somewhere near the equator. There are only two states in the U.S. that fit this mold: Texas and Florida. Although Texas is a more populous state with more cities to choose from, Barbicane isn't convinced yet of its merits. After hearing the news, representatives from Texas and Florida flood Baltimore, beefing harder than Biggie and Tupac.

Florida, on the other hand, has but one potential city: Tampa Town.", "analysis": ""}
