Being a lover and not a fighter, Ardan rushes to the forest with Maston to put a stop to it. They hurry into the woods. First, they find Captain Nicholl, but he's too busy saving a poor pigeon \"caught in the web\" of a spider to worry about Barbicane. Aw.

These guys clearly don't have the killer instinct. Ardan proposes a unique solution to their beef: The two of them should join him on his lunar journey. They agree.", "analysis": ""}
