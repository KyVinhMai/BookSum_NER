Although the club has made tons of advancements in cannon technology , they've had plenty of mishaps, too--most notably the hundreds of people killed during a faulty demonstration by a club member named J.T. Maston. Whoops. These guys are bummed when the war ends. What the heck are they supposed to do with themselves if they can't make things that kill people? We watch a meeting of the Gun Club in progress, and everyone--J.T. Maston included--is freaking out. The mood changes after the group receives a letter from Impey Barbicane, president and founder of the club. He promises to make a \"communication of great interest\" at a club assembly the following day.", "analysis": ""}
