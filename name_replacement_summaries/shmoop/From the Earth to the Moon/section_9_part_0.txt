Everyone, that is, except for Captain Nicholl. Captain Nicholl is the anti-Barbicane: Instead of investing his genius into the creation of weapons, Nicholl is \"a great manufacturer of iron plates\" . During the Civil War, these two men got into a fierce rivalry, each creating a new invention to outperform the other's, and so on and so forth. Barbicane won their duel when he invented a shot that could pound through any amount of Nicholl's armor. Nicholl actually invented a new type of plating to stop these shots, but the war ended before it could be implemented. Drat. After learning of the Gun Club's new mission, Nicholl starts writing op-eds for newspapers tearing the plan to pieces. He even places a \"series of wagers\" that the project will fall flat on its face. Oh, it's on. Bring it, Nicholl.", "analysis": ""}
