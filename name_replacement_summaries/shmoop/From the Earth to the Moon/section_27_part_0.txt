Maston at the Cambridge Observatory--he has seen the capsule. Unfortunately, though, it \"has not reached its goal\" and is instead orbiting the moon. There are two possible outcomes: Either the capsule will eventually get pulled to the moon's surface, or it will continue its orbit forever. Uh oh... Everyone thinks that it's a hopeless cause--everyone, that is, except the indefatigable J.T. Maston. Gosh darn it, nobody breaks this guy's stride. No matter what anyone says, Maston has full confidence that the three astronauts will manage to \"get out of their difficulties\" . We sure hope so, Maston--we sure hope so.", "analysis": ""}
