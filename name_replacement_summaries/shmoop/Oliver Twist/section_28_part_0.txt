The two ladies are sitting and eating their breakfast, and are described for the first time: the older lady is very upright and elegant, and the young lady is around sixteen or seventeen, and very lovely. They ask Giles how long Brittles has been gone, and Giles answers that he'd been gone for an hour or more. They joke about how Brittles \"always was a slow boy\" --it's a joke because Brittles started out working there when he was a boy. Now he's over 30, and they still call him a boy. Finally a coach pulls up, and a plump, friendly gentleman hops out and starts asking Mrs. Maylie and Rose how they're doing, after the fright of the night before. Rose says that they're fine, but that he should go and look after the \"poor creature up stairs\" . Mr. Losberne heads on upstairs. We don't get to see what goes on up there, but only see Mrs. Maylie and Rose downstairs, waiting for a long time, and looking anxious. Finally the doctor comes back and asks if they'd seen the thief. They say no, and Giles , says that he was going to tell them all about it, but that Mr. Losberne had arrived just then and interrupted. The doctor says that it is necessary that they see the thief.", "analysis": ""}
