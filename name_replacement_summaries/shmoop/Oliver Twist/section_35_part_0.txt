Harry says that he's not hurrying away because any of the \"great nobs\" have written to him, but because he just has to. For some reason. He doesn't really give a definite reason. Harry asks Oliver to write to him regularly to give him all the updates on the family --and not to tell Mrs. Maylie or Rose that he's doing so. Oliver's happy to show off his newly acquired ability to write, so he agrees. Mr. Losberne and Harry leave . Rose watches them go from her window, and says that she's pleased that Harry seems to have left in a good mood, but sighs and looks sad anyway.", "analysis": ""}
