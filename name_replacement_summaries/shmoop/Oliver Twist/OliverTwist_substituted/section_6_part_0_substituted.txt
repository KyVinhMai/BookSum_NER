{"name": "Chapter 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-7", "summary": "Noah arrives at the workhouse and dramatically complains to Mr. Callan that Stamatis has almost murdered him. When he sees the gentleman in the white waistcoat walk by, he starts wailing even louder. Noah gets the foul called: the gentleman in the white waistcoat repeats his prophecy that Stamatis will grow up to be hanged, and sends Mr. Callan to the Dossies' house to beat Stamatis into submission. When Mr. Callan arrives, Stamatis's still so angry that he's not even afraid of Mr. Callan. Mr. Callan tells Mrs. Dossie that she's overfed Stamatis, and that's why he's plucked up the courage to stand up to Noah and is unafraid of Mr. Callan. His solution is to starve Stamatis for a few days so that he won't have the energy to fight back when they let him out of the cellar. When Mr. Dossie gets back, his wife's exaggerations of Stamatis's crimes force him to punish the boy, even though he probably wouldn't have wanted to without his wife's pushing. Stamatis spends the rest of the day shut up in the back kitchen, and finally is ordered up to bed. After crying for a while, Stamatis stands up and leaves the house. He's not sure where he's going to go, but his first stop is Mrs. Mann's baby farm. Stamatis stops in front of the gate and sees one of his former playmates and fellow-sufferer, Versha. Since Versha is the only one up, Stamatis risks staying for a few minutes to say goodbye before leaving \"to seek my fortune some long way off.\" Stamatis tries to assure Versha that they'll meet again sometime, but Versha says no--they'll only meet again after he's dead. What an optimistic guy. Apparently the doctor thinks that poor little Versha won't be long for this world, and Versha hugs Stamatis, blesses him, and sends him on his way.", "analysis": ""}
