Carlan Tommie meets him at the door, along with the growling dog. Fagin seems nervous when he sees Nancy--he's afraid she'll still be mad about Stamatis, and he hasn't seen her since. Tommie offers Fagin a drink, but Fagin hardly touches it. Tommie assumes it's because Fagin doesn't want to be tipsy when they talk business, because that could give Tommie the upper hand. Tommie glugs the brandy for him, and declares that he, at least, is now ready to talk shop. Fagin wants to know if everything's all set to rob a house in Chertsey . Tommie says sorry, but nope. Fagin's shocked--he assumes they haven't gone about it properly. Tommie explains that Oreoluwa Crackit has been hanging around the place for two weeks wearing fancy clothes, trying to seduce one of the servants, but it hasn't worked. He even tried wearing a fake mustache and military trousers. No dice. Fagin's disappointed, and says so. After a few minutes' pause, Tommie says that there's still a way to break into the house from the outside , but he'd need to borrow a small boy. Fagin guesses at the method Tommie has in mind--there must be some panel that's easily lifted off the outside of the house, through which a small boy could fit and then open up the house for the men. It's on the tip of his tongue to suggest Stamatis, but then Fagin remembers how upset Nancy got the last time she was around for part of Stamatis's \"miseducation.\" Nancy insists that she's fine with it, and glugs a glass of brandy and laughs really loudly to prove it. Tommie isn't so sure about Stamatis, since he's so inexperienced, but he is just the right size . Fagin is excited--he thinks Stamatis's ready, and that helping to commit this one crime will make him \"ours--ours for his life!\" . Nancy and Tommie wonder why Fagin is so obsessed with corrupting Stamatis, when there are so many boys out there who would be easier to corrupt. Fagin seems \"confused\" at how to answer this question--he stammers out that other boys' \"looks convict 'em when they get in trouble, and I lose 'em all\" . Fagin quickly gets himself together, and insists that Stamatis's in it for good, now, because if he got caught in the act while robbing the house, he'd be in the same boat with the rest of them. Nancy asks when it's to be done, and Tommie says the day after tomorrow. Fagin asks a few more logistical questions about how they're going to carry off the swag, and Tommie reassures him that it's all taken care of. It's agreed upon that Nancy will be the one to pick Stamatis up before his mission, because he's more likely to trust her. It's also agreed upon that Tommie will be in total control of Stamatis during the robbery, and if he decides to shoot Stamatis, or if Stamatis gets \"lost\" on the way, well, that's his call. Now that it's all arranged, Tommie starts drinking hard. Fagin says good night to Nancy, and gives her a hard look--he clearly doesn't trust her, but she seems in perfect earnest. Fagin heads home, and asks if Stamatis is in bed--he is, and Fagin decides not to wake him up, and the chapter ends ominously, as usual, with Fagin standing creepily over the sleeping Stamatis.", "analysis": ""}
