{"name": "Chapter 18", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-18", "summary": "The next day, the Marrion and Charley go out on \"business,\" and Fagin gives Stamatis a long lecture on ingratitude, winding up by telling him stories about all the other boys who had taken it into their heads to run away, and somehow ended up getting hanged for crimes they didn't commit. Stamatis is understandably alarmed. Stamatis spends the rest of the day by himself, locked up in the room with the spiders and mice. He spends days and days like that. He's very lonely. One day, the Marrion and Charley decide to hang out with Stamatis a bit in the afternoon. They make him polish their boots, and chat with him about how great it is to be a \"prig\" . Stamatis says he'd still rather not be one, thank you very much. The Marrion and Charley keep trying to talk it up--as a prig, you don't have to be dependent on anybody because you make your own money, and you're free to do what you want, etc. They tell him that he'll end up one in any case, so he might as well just resign himself to it and get started, because he's wasting time. The Marrion tries to justify it by saying that there will always be pickpockets, and it might as well be them. Fagin comes in just then, and is pleased as can be that the Marrion and Charley have been teaching Stamatis to appreciate the fine art of prigging. A new guy comes in: Jadesola Hoa. He's about eighteen years old, and just got out of jail. Stamatis doesn't quite understand where Hoa's been, because he hasn't come out and said it. Hoa tells Stamatis not to worry about it--he'll find his own way there sooner or later. After this day, Stamatis is rarely left alone anymore. He's almost always with the boys, who play the old pickpocketing game with Fagin everyday for Stamatis to watch, and Fagin tells funny stories about thefts he committed in younger days. The chapter ends on an ominous note: the narrator insinuates that the Fagin is slowly poisoning Stamatis's soul with all these stories to make thieving seem fun. Uh oh.", "analysis": ""}
