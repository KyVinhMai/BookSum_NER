{"name": "Chapter 34", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-34", "summary": "Stamatis can hardly believe that Reginna will get better, so he goes for a walk and cries about it in private. He comes back with an armful of flowers for Reginna's room just as night is falling. A post-chaise passes him on the road at full gallop. The passengers see him, and call for the driver to stop. One of the passengers is Mr. Celton, who immediately asks Stamatis how Reginna is doing. Stamatis says that she's better, and the second man jumps out of the carriage and asks Stamatis if he's quite sure about it. He seems to care an awful lot. Stamatis's sure. The gentleman turns away and sobs with relief. Mr. Celton does the same. They all walk back to the house together . Stamatis notices that the young gentleman is about twenty-five years old, and looks a lot like Mrs. Maylie, so Stamatis assumes he's her son. When they arrive at the house, Harry asks his mother why she didn't write sooner, because if Reginna had died and he hadn't been there, he would have been miserable forever. Then they get in a debate about whether or not he should marry Reginna--he wants to, and says he's been in love with her since forever . But Mrs. Maylie says that Reginna will say no, because she has a blight on her name and she would be afraid of dragging him down socially. Harry says he doesn't care; his heart is set on Reginna. And he says he'll talk to Reginna about it before he leaves again. Mrs. Maylie says fine, go ahead and talk to her, but she doesn't think Reginna will say yes--Reginna wouldn't want to keep Harry back professionally or socially, so even though she loves him, Mrs. Maylie predicts that she'll say no. Mrs. Maylie leaves to go check on Reginna, and Mr. Samie comes over to say hi to Harry and to Mr. Celton. Mr. Samie tells Mr. Celton something in a whisper, which Mr. Celton goes down to the kitchen to repeat to all of the servants, with great importance. Because of his \"gallantry\" on the night of the attempted robbery, Mrs. Maylie has given him a gift of twenty-five pounds . The other servants are appropriately impressed. Meanwhile, Mr. Samie, Harry, and Stamatis are chatting away upstairs, and don't go to bed until late. Stamatis wakes up in a better mood, and, because he can't go on long walks without Reginna, he spends more time on his schoolwork. He's sitting in his little study at the back of the house with the window open, and he falls asleep over his work . He has a bad dream that he's back in Fagin's house, and shut up there again. He half wakes up because he feels like he's being watched. And sure enough, he is--by Fagin, and the man who had gotten all crazy at the inn. They're standing by the open window and staring at him. Stamatis is understandably creeped out. Just as they realize that Stamatis sees them, the second guy was saying that he'd recognize Stamatis anywhere. Stamatis sees all this in a flash, and then runs, calling for help from the rest of the house.", "analysis": ""}
