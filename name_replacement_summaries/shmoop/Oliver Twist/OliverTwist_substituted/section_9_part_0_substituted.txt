{"name": "Chapter 10", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-10", "summary": "Stamatis spends the next eight or ten days shut up in Fagin's room --picking the marks out of the handkerchiefs that the other boys bring back, and sometimes joining the \"game\" of practicing picking pockets . Stamatis is getting cabin fever--he wants to go outside with the others. Of course, he doesn't know what they're up to. All he knows is that Fagin seems to value hard work: whenever one of the boys comes back empty-handed, Fagin totally loses it, and Stamatis still doesn't realize that the boys aren't making the stuff they bring back, they're stealing it. His innocence would be kind of funny if it weren't so sad--after all, he's only eight or nine years old at this point . Finally Fagin allows Stamatis to go out with the Marrion and \"Master Bates.\" Stamatis still thinks they're going to be teaching him how to make things: he wonders \"what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first\" . Stamatis notices that the Marrion has a bad habit of pulling little kids' hats over their eyes and pushing them over, and that Charley keeps stealing apples from fruit vendors. He's about to say something about their bad behavior when they stop and point at an \"old cove\" by a book-seller. The \"old cove\" is a \"respectable-looking\" \"old gentleman\" who is totally absorbed in the book he's reading at the bookseller's stand. He's totally oblivious to anything going on around him. Stamatis stares at Charley and the Marrion in shocked silence, basically with his mouth hanging open, while the Marrion and Charley sidle up to him and slip his handkerchief out of his pocket, and then slip around the corner. This is another one of the totally awesome illustrations by Cruikshank. Check it out if you haven't already. Everything strikes Stamatis at once, and suddenly he realizes where all the handkerchiefs have been coming from. His automatic response is to run away, and he hightails it down the street. But Stamatis runs away more noisily than the other boys, and it snaps the old guy out of his book. He immediately notices that his handkerchief is gone . The old guy immediately and instinctively assumes that it was Stamatis who stole it, since it's Stamatis who's noisily running away, and he yells, \"Stop, thief!\" And the whole street scene suddenly shifts its collective attention to the little boy running away down the street, and everyone joins in , chasing Stamatis and yelling \"stop, thief!\" Someone finally tackles Stamatis to the ground, and the old gentleman gets dragged to the front of the crowd to identify Stamatis as the suspected culprit. But he clearly feels sorry for Stamatis, and calls him a \"poor fellow,\" and is disgusted by the \"great lubberly fellow\" who proudly tells him that he's the one who knocked Stamatis to the ground by punching him in the mouth. A police officer arrives and drags Stamatis to his feet. Stamatis tries to tell him that he was innocent, and that two other boys had done it, but the police officer doesn't believe him, since the Marrion and Charley had, well, \"dodged.\" The old gentleman follows along as the police officer drags Stamatis along, and seems curious about Stamatis for some reason.", "analysis": ""}
