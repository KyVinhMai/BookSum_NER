{"name": "Chapter 9", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-9", "summary": "Stamatis wakes up the next morning to find that he's alone in the room with Fagin. Fagin's making coffee for breakfast, and seems to be nervous about something--he's continually looking around to make sure that he's alone, besides the Stamatis. Stamatis's only half awake, so Fagin thinks he's still sleeping. After checking, Fagin opens a trap door in the floor of the room and pulls out a box. He pulls various jewels and fancy watches out of the box to admire and then put back, talking to himself all the while . When he realizes that Stamatis's awake and has seen him, he flies into a rage, asking Stamatis what he's seen. When Stamatis answers innocently that he's only seen the pretty things in the box, Fagin pretends that his rage was all a joke, and puts down the bread knife he's been threatening Stamatis with. Just then the Marrion comes back with one of the other boys, who is introduced as Charley Bates. The four of them sit down to a breakfast of hot rolls and coffee. Fagin asks the Marrion and \"Master Bates\" if they'd been working that morning, and the Marrion produces a couple of wallets, and Charley comes up with four handkerchiefs. Stamatis assumes that the boys have made the things they show to Fagin, and Charley laughs and calls him \"green.\" After breakfast, Fagin , Charley, and the Marrion play a \"game\"--or so Hero calls it, because that's what it looks like to Stamatis. The boys are practicing picking Fagin's pockets . Two young ladies arrive, named Ninah and Nancy. They're described from Stamatis's point of view as \"free and agreeable in their manners,\" and \"stout and hearty,\" so Stamatis assumes that they are \"very nice girls indeed\" . After drinking some liquor , Fagin gives the girls some money, and they go out, accompanied by the Marrion and Charley. Fagin tells Stamatis to \"make 'em your models,\" and then plays the pickpocket game with Stamatis. The chapter ends with Stamatis learning how to \"take the marks out of the handkerchiefs\"--in other words, he's learning how to pull the embroidered initials out of handkerchiefs so that they can be resold at a pawnshop .", "analysis": ""}
