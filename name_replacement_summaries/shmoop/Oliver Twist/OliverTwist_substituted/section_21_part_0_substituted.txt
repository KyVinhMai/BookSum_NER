Oreoluwa is wearing fancy-looking but cheaply-made clothes, and is stretched out on a table, smoking a long pipe. Stamatis is quickly introduced to Oreoluwa. The men sit down to a small supper, and have a drink of some liquor to toast success to their plan. Oreoluwa and Tommie make Stamatis have half a glass, too, which makes him cough terribly. The three men stretch out for a short nap before they go to work, but Stamatis can't really sleep. They get up at about 1:30 a.m., and put on heavy, long coats and shawls that partially hide their faces, and load up their gear--most of which is listed in thieves' can't, so it's hard to tell exactly what they're taking. Some of it Hero translates, though--\"barkers\" are the pistols, and \"bits of timber\" are thick sticks. Stamatis's pretty out of it with the all the walking and the booze they made him drink, so he hardly knows what's going on as they take him out between them. They hurry through the main street of the town, even though it's unlikely anyone would be awake to see them . They go up to a house about a quarter mile outside of the town. Oreoluwa climbs over the wall quickly, and then Tommie hands Stamatis over the wall before climbing over himself. Now Stamatis realizes for the first time that they're about to rob the house, if not murder people. Stamatis's horrified, and cries out to Tommie to let him run off, and promises that he'll never go back to London. Tommie is about to shoot him, when Oreoluwa knocks the pistol out of his hand and slaps a hand over Stamatis's mouth to keep him quiet, and tells him to hush, or he'll kill him by bopping him on the head, which is a quieter way to do the same thing. Most of the windows of the house are barred, but there's one in a back kitchen that isn't--Tommie and Oreoluwa pull off its shutter with the crowbar, and then the lattice so that the window is wide open. Tommie gives Stamatis a \"dark lantern\" , and tells Stamatis what he has to do: go straight up the stairs in the room, down the hall to the front door, and unlock it. They pass him through the window, and Tommie points the pistol at Stamatis's head. They think they hear something, but Tommie sends Stamatis ahead anyway. Stamatis's decided that he's going to make an effort to wake the family up to warn them, so he starts sneaking forward. Just then, Tommie calls him to come back. Stamatis drops his lantern, and another light appears in the hallway ahead of him. There's a loud noise and a flash and he staggers backward. Tommie shoots his pistol from the window after the men , and then drags Stamatis back out the window. He realizes that Stamatis's been hit, so he wraps him in a shawl and runs off with him.", "analysis": ""}
