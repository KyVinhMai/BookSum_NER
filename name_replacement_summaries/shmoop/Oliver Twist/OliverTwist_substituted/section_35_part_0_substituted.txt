Harry says that he's not hurrying away because any of the \"great nobs\" have written to him, but because he just has to. For some reason. He doesn't really give a definite reason. Harry asks Stamatis to write to him regularly to give him all the updates on the family --and not to tell Mrs. Maylie or Reginna that he's doing so. Stamatis's happy to show off his newly acquired ability to write, so he agrees. Mr. Samie and Harry leave . Reginna watches them go from her window, and says that she's pleased that Harry seems to have left in a good mood, but sighs and looks sad anyway.", "analysis": ""}
