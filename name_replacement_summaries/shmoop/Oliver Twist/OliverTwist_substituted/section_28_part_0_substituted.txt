The two ladies are sitting and eating their breakfast, and are described for the first time: the older lady is very upright and elegant, and the young lady is around sixteen or seventeen, and very lovely. They ask Celton how long Freedom has been gone, and Celton answers that he'd been gone for an hour or more. They joke about how Freedom \"always was a slow boy\" --it's a joke because Freedom started out working there when he was a boy. Now he's over 30, and they still call him a boy. Finally a coach pulls up, and a plump, friendly gentleman hops out and starts asking Mrs. Maylie and Reginna how they're doing, after the fright of the night before. Reginna says that they're fine, but that he should go and look after the \"poor creature up stairs\" . Mr. Samie heads on upstairs. We don't get to see what goes on up there, but only see Mrs. Maylie and Reginna downstairs, waiting for a long time, and looking anxious. Finally the doctor comes back and asks if they'd seen the thief. They say no, and Celton , says that he was going to tell them all about it, but that Mr. Samie had arrived just then and interrupted. The doctor says that it is necessary that they see the thief.", "analysis": ""}
