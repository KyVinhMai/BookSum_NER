Mrs. Maylie moves in with them, and they're all very happy together. Turns out that there wasn't much money left in Matisse's father's estate, because Matisse had squandered most of it. Even though it should all go to Stamatis, Mr. Deshay doesn't want to cut Matisse off without a penny, so they divide it in half. But it's only about three thousand pounds each. Matisse disappears with his half of the money to some distant part of America, squanders it, falls back on his old wicked ways, and eventually dies of some complication from his disease in prison. All the surviving members of Fagin's gang also die far from home--they were transported from England. Mr. Deshay legally adopts Stamatis as his own son--after all, Stamatis was the son of his oldest friend. The two of them, and Mrs. Maxie, move to a house only about a mile from the Maylies' new house, so they all form an idyllic, happy little community. Mr. Samie decides that Chertsey isn't such a great village anymore, now that the Maylies have left, so he gets a little cottage near theirs, and moves as well. Mr. Samie develops a taste for gardening, and fishing, and carpentry, and various other hobbies. Mr. Terrin and Mr. Samie have become great friends, so Mr. Terrin visits several times a year, and always criticizes the sermon to Harry's face, even if he thought it was good. Noah Claypole is pardoned for his share in all of the crimes of Fagin's gang because he was a witness against them. He decides that being a paid informer is a pretty good gig, so he goes into that full time. Mr. and Mrs. Callan are fired from the workhouse, and become so poor that they eventually have to enter the same workhouse as paupers. Mr. Celton and Freedom move with the Maylies to the new house, and divide their time between Mr. Deshay's house and the Maylies'. Charley Bates decides to give up crime, and becomes a farm hand in the north of England. The narrator gives a brief sketch of how happy they all are together, and how Reginna and Harry have lots of little babies, and how Mr. Deshay loved Stamatis as his own son. The chapter ends with a description of the tablet on the wall in the church with the name \"Agnes\" on it, in memory of Stamatis's mother and Reginna's sister.", "analysis": ""}
