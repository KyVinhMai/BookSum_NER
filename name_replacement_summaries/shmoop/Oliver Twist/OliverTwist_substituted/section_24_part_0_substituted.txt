The Artful Marrion, Charley, and Hoa are playing whist , and the Marrion is surreptitiously looking at Hoa's hand. Unsurprisingly, the Marrion wins every time. Hoa has finally had enough, and seems amazed at the Marrion's luck. Fagin is less amazed. After killing time for a while, the Marrion asks Hoa why he seems so down. Before Hoa can answer, the Marrion asks Fagin and Charley for their opinion. Fagin diplomatically declines to answer, but Charley thinks it's because Hoa's in love with Arisbet, and starts laughing like crazy because Hoa is in looooooove. Fagin comforts Hoa, and says that Arisbet's \"a fine girl,\" and that if he does as she tells him to do, he'll be a successful thief and make his fortune. Of course, the reason Hoa went to jail was because he'd followed Arisbet's advice, but he says he'd do it again if Arisbet told him to. He's so angry with Charley , that he runs across the room to slug him. Charley dodges, and he hits Fagin in the chest, instead. Just then, the Marrion hears the bell downstairs, and grabs the candle to go see who it is. He comes back up and whispers to Fagin. Someone has come back \"alone;\" the news makes Fagin nervous. Charley and Hoa leave the room to make way for the --it's Oreoluwa Crackit, looking rather the worse for wear. He won't tell them what happened until he's eaten something. Finally, he asks how Carlan Tommie is doing. Obviously, Fagin and the Marrion don't know, and were expecting that Oreoluwa would. Oreoluwa says that the job failed, but Fagin already knew that from the newspaper . Oreoluwa tells the story: in short, they ran away from the house, but there were dogs after them and the whole country seemed to be awake, and eventually Tommie had left Stamatis alone in a ditch. Oreoluwa doesn't know what's happened to either of them since--it was each man for himself. Fagin yells, tears at his hair, and runs out of the house.", "analysis": ""}
