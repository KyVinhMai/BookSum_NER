{"name": "Chapter 41", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-41", "summary": "Reginna doesn't know what to do, but she really, really wants to save Nancy from her life in the streets. The Maylies are planning on staying in London for only three days on their way to the seashore, and Reginna doesn't know how to deal with the information Nancy's given her in only that time. She doesn't want to tell Mr. Samie, because he's too impetuous . And she doesn't want to tell Mrs. Maylie, because Mrs. Maylie would immediately tell Mr. Samie. Reginna thinks about asking Harry, but doesn't want to ask him for help when she's just rejected him. Seems like bad form. She finally decides that asking Harry is the best option, when Stamatis comes in, all smiles, saying that Mr. Deshay is back from the West Indies. Reginna decides to tell Mr. Deshay all about it, and offers to take Stamatis to see him herself. They take off right away, and Reginna goes in first to tell Mr. Deshay that they'd found Stamatis. Mr. Deshay is sitting in his study with Mr. Terrin, and Reginna tells them that she has news about Stamatis. Mr. Terrin assumes that it's bad news, of course. Reginna assures them that Stamatis's a great kid--the best boy in the world--and that he's downstairs waiting. Mr. Deshay is delighted, and immediately runs out to see the best boy in the world. Mr. Terrin thinks Reginna is just peachy, so he takes this moment to plant a big wet one on her cheek. He excuses himself by saying that he's old enough to be her grandpa, and that she's a good girl and he likes her. Reginna thinks he's kind of odd, but doesn't say so. Mr. Deshay comes back in with Stamatis, and Mr. Terrin is happy to see him, too. Mrs. Maxie comes in, and they all cry over each other some more. After everyone's done crying, Reginna takes Mr. Deshay to the next room to tell him what Nancy had said. Mr. Deshay says that he'll tell Mr. Samie and Mrs. Maylie all of it, and keep Mr. Samie from doing anything stupid or rash. Mr. Samie, when finds out about it, does indeed want to go raid Fagin's house, but Mr. Deshay persuades him to chill. Their main goal, Mr. Deshay points out, is to figure out who Stamatis's parents were, and to get his inheritance back from his evil brother. Mr. Samie still thinks they should try to get the thieves all hanged or transported, but Mr. Deshay points out that they can't do that without breaking Reginna's promise to Nancy. And besides, they'll probably all get themselves hanged or transported soon enough, anyway. Harry Maylie and Mr. Terrin get added to the committee, and filled in on what's going on. So now everyone knows about Matisse and the big plot against Stamatis except for Stamatis. Mr. Deshay says that he was out of the country on business that is still up in the air, so he won't tell them about it until it's all squared away. Then they go out to supper and rejoin Stamatis, who probably thinks they're all conspiring against him or something.", "analysis": ""}
