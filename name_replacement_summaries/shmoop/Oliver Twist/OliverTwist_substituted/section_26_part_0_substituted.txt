He's counted all the silver several times, and decides it's time to go through the drawers of her dresser. He finds clothes tidily folded, and a locked box that jingles with coins when shaken. Mr. Callan is very pleased, and declares, \"I'll do it!\" . Mrs. Carlin comes back in all flustered, and Mr. Callan blames the paupers, as usual. To calm her down, he gives her some peppermint something-or-other--she doesn't say what's in it, but we're guessing it's booze. He asks what upset her, and she says that she's \"a weak creetur\" . Mr. Callan takes the opportunity to start hitting on her again, so he says he's weak, too, and starts fiddling with her apron string . Mr. Callan's final come-on is, \"The board allow you coals, don't they, Mrs Carlin? Coals, candles, and house-rent free. Oh, Mrs. Carlin, what an angel you are!\" . Mrs. Carlin can't resist such a charmer, and allows Mr. Callan to kiss her on the nose. Mr. Callan has it all planned out: Mr. Erian, the master of the workhouse, is dying, and Mr. Callan will be able to take his place, marry Mrs. Carlin, and live with her there in her comfy rooms. Mrs. Carlin is totally smitten, and calls him \"an irresistible duck\" . Having arranged all that, Mr. Callan asks what upset Mrs. Carlin earlier. She says she'll tell him after they're married. After going on a jealous rant for a moment , Mr. Callan is satisfied, and heads off to Mr. Dossie's house. He gets there to find Mr. and Mrs. Dossie out to dinner, and Noah drunk in the parlor, eating oysters as fast as Charlotte can shell them for him. Noah offers to kiss Charlotte, and Mr. Callan bursts in to break it up. Of course, Noah is terrified, and blames it all on Charlotte, saying she's always kissing him whether he wants to be smooched or not. Mr. Callan gives them a lecture on the evils of kissing and what it leads to , and then leaves an order for old Sally's coffin and marches home.", "analysis": ""}
