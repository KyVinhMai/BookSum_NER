{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-5", "summary": "Stamatis is understandably depressed in his new surroundings--he's in the dark and surrounded by coffins in a strange place--but he does finally go to sleep. He's woken up by kicking at the shop door. The owner of the kicking feet promises to \"whop\" Stamatis when he comes in, and introduces himself as \"Mister Noah Claypole.\" Noah is another apprentice in the undertaker's shop and, as a charity boy himself , he's used to being at the bottom of the ladder. So Noah's pretty psyched to have Stamatis around to beat up on. We think Noah has some repressed anger issues. Noah and Charlotte, the \"slatternly\" servant girl introduced at the end of the previous chapter, are apparently good friends: Charlotte saves Noah the best pieces of bacon for his breakfast, while Stamatis again gets the scraps, and has to eat them in the coldest corner of the kitchen. After Stamatis's been there for about a month, Mr. Dossie comes up with the great idea of using Stamatis as a \"mute\" in children's funerals--in other words, they'd dress him up in black and have him go along with the funeral procession to make it all look more \"interesting.\" After all, as Mr. Dossie points out, \"there's an expression of melancholy in his face which is very interesting\" . Mr. Callan comes by to order a funeral for some poor person who had the audacity to die at the workhouse . He ignores Stamatis entirely, to Stamatis's great relief. Stamatis has to go along with Mr. Dossie to measure the corpse for the coffin. He discovers that the person who died was a wife and mother, and her bereaved husband is almost crazy with grief. The children are half-starved, and the dead woman's mother can't talk about anything but having a new cloak and some cake for the funeral. The husband goes on a long rant about how his wife had starved to death, and he blames the whole workhouse/poor-law system. All in all, it doesn't make Stamatis all that enthusiastic about the funeral profession--especially since Mr. Dossie seems to take it all in stride. The funeral itself is even more depressing: Stamatis, the husband, and the mother are the only people there . The minister is over an hour late, and keeps them waiting in the rain in the graveyard. Once he arrives, he babbles out the funeral service in four minutes, and then runs off again without trying to comfort the husband or offer to help his family. Cemetery space was at a premium in those days, so poor people had to share graves--the coffin was plopped into a grave that was already so full of other coffins that hers was only a couple of feet below the surface. When Stamatis admits to Mr. Dossie that he didn't like the funeral at all, Mr. Dossie assures him that he'll get used to it in time. Stamatis isn't so sure.", "analysis": ""}
