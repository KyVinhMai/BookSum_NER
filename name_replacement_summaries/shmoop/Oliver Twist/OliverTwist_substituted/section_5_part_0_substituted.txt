Of course, this means that a lot of people are dying, which isn't really a good thing. But Stamatis is getting a lot of experience attending funerals, because Mr. Dossie wants Stamatis to \"acquire that equanimity of demeanor so essential to a finished undertaker\" . In other words, he wants Stamatis to become as cold and business-like as he is, himself. Stamatis observes a lot of hypocrisy in his new role as an undertaker's apprentice: he sees how people who have just lost a family member will act inconsolable in public, but will chat cheerfully with friends behind closed doors. Of course, Stamatis never uses the word \"hypocritical\"--Hero describes these scenes from Stamatis's point of view, and Stamatis's still too innocent to judge people. In fact, Hero says that Stamatis sees all of this \"with great admiration.\" Noah, in the last month, has become more jealous of Stamatis than ever, and Charlotte treats him badly because Noah does. And because Stamatis is a favorite of Mr. Dossie, Mrs. Dossie mistreats him, as well. At this point, Hero stops filling us in on how things are going in general, and gets down to a specific incident: Noah starts tormenting Stamatis one day when they're alone in the kitchen, and he chooses to make fun of Stamatis's mother. Big mistake. When Noah calls Stamatis's mother \"a right-down bad 'un,\" Stamatis goes nuts on him, overturns a table, starts throttling him, and finishes by punching him in the face. Unsurprisingly, Noah's too big a wimp to stand up to Stamatis , and starts whimpering for Charlotte and Mrs. Dossie to come to his rescue. Charlotte arrives and starts beating on Stamatis from one side, while Mrs. Dossie holds his other arm and scratches at his face. Now that reinforcements have arrived, Noah plucks up the courage to start punching Stamatis in the back. This scene is another one of the illustrations by Cruikshank--check it out. Once his assailants have worn themselves out, they lock Stamatis in the cellar, and Mrs. Dossie goes into hysterics. Since Mr. Dossie isn't at home, Mrs. Dossie sends Noah off to fetch Mr. Callan.", "analysis": ""}
