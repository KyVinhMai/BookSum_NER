Stamatis has recovered from his fainting-fit, and wakes to see that Mr. Deshay has taken the portrait out of his room entirely. Mrs. Maxie explains that it's because seeing the portrait got him over-excited, and Stamatis doesn't argue. To avoid talking about the portrait, Mrs. Maxie launches into a looooong description of her children, and their children, and how dutiful they all are. Then she teaches him how to play cribbage . Now that Stamatis's better, Mr. Deshay thinks it's time for Stamatis to have a new suit of clothes. Stamatis takes his old clothes and sells them to a used-clothing salesman , and gives the money to a servant who's been nice to him. Mr. Deshay asks to see Stamatis in his study, and after Mrs. Maxie has fussed over his collar for a few minutes, Stamatis goes. Mr. Deshay sees how curious Stamatis is about all of the books in his study, so they have a brief conversation about whether Stamatis might want to read them all , or whether Stamatis would want to write a book himself one day. Stamatis says he'd much rather be a book-seller than an author. Mr. Deshay then turns more serious, and basically tells Stamatis that he's been disappointed in people many, many times, but that he trusts Stamatis. He hopes that telling Stamatis how many times he's been crushed by disappointment will keep Stamatis from hurting him again. No pressure, Stamatis! Just as Stamatis has finished crying , and is just starting to tell his story to Mr. Deshay, they are interrupted by a servant, who announces that Mr. Terrin has arrived. Mr. Terrin comes into the room and is clearly in a bad mood--he says it's because he tripped on some orange peel in the stairway, and says that orange peel will be the death of him, or he'll \"eat his own head.\" That seems to be a favorite expression of his. Mr. Deshay calms Mr. Terrin down on the subject of orange peels, and introduces him to Stamatis. Mr. Terrin might have been inclined to like Stamatis, but the orange peel has put him out and he refuses to acknowledge anything good about Stamatis until Stamatis has proven himself. An opportunity for Stamatis to prove himself presents itself almost immediately: a pile of books is delivered from the bookseller we met in chapter ten, but not all of them were paid for, and some need to be returned. Mr. Deshay is just as eager for Stamatis to prove himself to Mr. Terrin as Stamatis is, so he sends Stamatis out on the errand, with a stack of books to return, and a five pound note and instructions to bring back the change. Mr. Terrin bets that Stamatis won't come back, but will make off with the books and the money and go back to the thieves, and Mr. Deshay insists that he'll be back within twenty minutes. They set the watch on the table and watch the minutes tick by, but Stamatis doesn't come back.", "analysis": ""}
