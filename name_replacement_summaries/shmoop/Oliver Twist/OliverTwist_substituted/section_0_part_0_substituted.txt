Stamatis is born in a workhouse in a town called Mudfog , and is described as a \"new burden upon the parish\" . . After kissing Stamatis with \"cold white lips,\" Stamatis's mother dies, leaving her son all alone and at the mercy of the parish authorities. All we learn about his mother at this point is that a) she was found lying in the street after having walked a long way, but nobody knows where she'd come from, and b) she wasn't wearing a wedding ring, so the doctor assumes that she was unmarried and that Stamatis is illegitimate, and c) she was a \"good-looking girl.\" Hero hints ominously at the fate awaiting Stamatis as \"a parish child\" in the closing sentences of the first chapter.", "analysis": ""}
