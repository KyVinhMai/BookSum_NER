{"name": "Chapter 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-23", "summary": "The second book opens with Mrs. Carlin , the matron at the workhouse where Stamatis was born, making herself a comfortable cup of tea on a cold and bitter night. She's in the middle of reflecting on how lonely she is when there's a knock at the door. She assumes it's one of the workhouse paupers, come to tell her that someone or other is dying, and she's annoyed by it: \"they always die when I'm at meals,\" she complains . But it's not a pauper, it's Mr. Callan. Mrs. Carlin quickly changes her tone of voice. Mr. Callan complains about how demanding the poor people all are--even after being given bread and cheese, a man with a large family asked if he could have \"a pocket-handkerchief full\" of coals to make a fire . He tells another story of a man who came looking for relief at the overseer's house when the overseer was having a dinner party--the man hardly had any clothes on , and the overseer offered him a pound of potatoes and some oatmeal. The man said that the food wouldn't save him, and that he'd go die in the streets. And that's exactly what he did. Mr. Callan thinks that shows how \"obstinate\" paupers are. Even as he finishes telling Mrs. Carlin about the man who died in the street of the cold, he pulls out two bottles of good port wine that he's brought with him, \"for the infirmary,\" and puts on his hat as though to go. But then he stays when Mrs. Carlin invites him to a cup of tea. Mrs. Carlin gets him a cup of tea, and asks him if he wants it sweet. He says he wants it \"very sweet,\" and gives her a tender look . He eats his toast and drinks his tea in silence, until he comments on her cat and kittens. She says that they make good companions, because they are \"so happy, so frolicsome, and so cheerful\" . Mr. Callan uses this as an awkward way to hit on her: he says that \"any cat or kitten that could live with you, ma'am, and not be fond of its home, must be an ass, ma'am,\" and that he would himself \"drown\" any cat so ungrateful . Mrs. Carlin tells him that drowning cats is \"cruel\" and \"hard-hearted\" . Mr. Callan doesn't argue with \"cruel\" but objects to \"hard-hearted.\" He scoots his chair away from the fire . And then he scoots it again--and again--until he's quite close to her again on the other side. Mrs. Carlin is now pinned between the fire and Mr. Callan . Mr. Callan asks Mrs. Carlin if she is \"hard-hearted,\" and when she wants to know why he asks, he kisses her. She threatens to scream, but then there's a knock at the door. This time it is a pauper, letting Mrs. Carlin know that \"old Sally\" is dying, and has something she wants to tell Mrs. Carlin before she dies. Mrs. Carlin is very put out about all this, but does get up to go, and asks Mr. Callan to wait until she gets back. While she's out, Mr. Callan goes around her room weighing and counting her silver sugar-tongs, milk pot, spoons, and examining all her furniture.", "analysis": ""}
