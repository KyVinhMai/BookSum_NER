Charley thinks that the whole incident with Stamatis was hilarious, and he can't stop laughing about it, but the Marrion's worried about what Fagin will say. The Marrion was right to worry--as soon as they tell Fagin what happened, he begins to shake the Marrion violently while Charley howls. Fortunately, the Marrion wears a coat about ten sizes too big, so he just slips out of it. The Marrion grabs the long toasting fork that they use to toast sausages in the fire and takes a swing at Fagin with it--but misses. Fagin throws a big jug of ale at the Marrion, and also misses . But Fagin hits a newcomer, by mistake, as he's coming in the door. And the newcomer is Not Happy. The newcomer is Carlan Tommie, who growls that the way Fagin treats the boys, he wouldn't blame them if they murdered him . Meanwhile, despite great verbal and physical abuse from Tommie, a shaggy and scarred-up white dog slinks into the room after him. Fagin doesn't much care for Tommie, saying that he's a \"covetous, avaricious, in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence\" . And for mentioning that he occasionally \"blabs\" on his gang-members, so he interrupts Tommie, and gives him a drink . Fagin says that he's afraid Stamatis will say something that will get them all in trouble. Tommie agrees, and looks rather pleased at the thought of Fagin getting into trouble. Fagin comes back by telling Tommie that if he ever got taken, Tommie would have the worst of it. Everyone is dismal at the thought of Stamatis ratting them out, so they decide that someone will have to go and ask where he is. But obviously none of them wants to march up to the police office. Then Nancy walks in. They ask her to do it, since the police don't know her in this neighborhood. She's reluctant, but with some persuading from Carlan, she agrees. Nancy puts on a respectable-looking outfit, and goes to the police station to ask about her \"poor little brother.\" Her costume and act are convincing enough that she gets the officer in the striped waistcoat to tell her that he'd gone off with Mr. Deshay, and that he lives somewhere in Pentonville. Nancy goes back to Fagin's den with the news, and Carlan and the Marrion immediately set out to do something about it.", "analysis": ""}
