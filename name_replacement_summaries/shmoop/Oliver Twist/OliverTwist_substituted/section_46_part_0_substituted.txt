Noah is sleeping on the floor nearby. He's thinking about what Noah has told him, and is torn between rage at Nancy for daring to tell secrets to strangers, and distrust at her promise to them that she would never betray him. Then the bell rings--it's Tommie. Fagin gives him a funny look, and Tommie asks what's up. Fagin breaks it to him slowly: first he asks Tommie what he'd do if Noah had betrayed them. Tommie says that he'd murder the kid. Fagin then asks, what if he, Fagin, had betrayed them all? Tommie gets enraged just from the suggestion, and says that he'd murder him, too, and describes how he'd do it in gory detail. What if it were Charley, or the Marrion? Tommie would treat them all the same. Having gotten Tommie up to this pitch of rage, Fagin wakes up Noah , and asks him to tell Tommie what he'd heard by the bridge. Before Noah can repeat it, Fagin sums it up, and Noah just has to confirm it. Then Fagin gets Noah to repeat Nancy's explanation of why she hadn't come the week before--because Carlan had kept her home by force, and that she'd only been able to get out before by drugging him with laudanum. Noah thought that was the funniest part of the whole thing. Carlan Tommie isn't so amused. He's in a total rage, and tries to break out of Fagin's grasp. Fagin stops him, and tells him not to be too violent for safety--they understand each other. Tommie runs home, and bursts into the room. Nancy is lying in the bed, half dressed. She's happy to see him back. He tells her to get up, and throws the lit candle into the fire. She starts to open the curtains, but he tells her not to bother--there's enough light already for what he has to do. Nancy starts to get alarmed, and Tommie grabs her and puts a hand over her mouth. Nancy promises not to scream, and demands to know what she's done. Tommie tells her that she was watched, and that every word she said was overheard. Nancy knows she's in for it--she clings to him, and asks him to spare her life, since she refused to betray him. She swears up and down that she never betrayed him, and begs him not to kill her for the sake of his own soul. She tells him about the little home, far away, that the young lady had offered her, but that she had refused for his sake, and asks that they both leave London, and live far away from each other and try to forget all their past crimes. Tommie pulls his pistol out, and is about to shoot her when he realizes what a huge noise that would make. So he beats her in the face with it as hard as he can. Nancy falls to the ground, and pulls herself up on her knees, clutching Reginna's white handkerchief in her hands. Tommie staggers back, grabs a heavy club, and strikes her to the ground.", "analysis": ""}
