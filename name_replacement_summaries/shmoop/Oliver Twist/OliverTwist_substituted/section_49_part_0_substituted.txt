The houses are all in rough shape, falling into each other, or into the river. Oreoluwa Crackit, Jadesola Hoa, and Kags are sitting in an upper room of one of these houses. Oreoluwa asks when Fagin was arrested, and Hoa answers that it happened around 2 p.m. He and Charley were able to hide, but Damarie was arrested, and Ninah got hysterical, so they put her into \"the hospital\" . Charley, Hoa tells them, will be with them shortly. All of the other hideouts have been found out, and are crawling with cops . They expect that Damarie will give evidence against Fagin, so that Fagin will be convicted as an accessory to Nancy's murder. Hoa describes how bloodthirsty the mob was when Fagin was arrested. Just then, Tommie's dog runs into the room. Oreoluwa hopes that Tommie isn't close behind--he doesn't seem to be. They wonder where \"he\" could be, and whether \"he\" has \"made away with himself\" . None of them are willing to call \"him\" by his name. They figure that Tommie must have left the country, and left the dog behind. They hear knocking at the door downstairs. At first they think it's Charley, but Charley doesn't knock like that. It's Tommie. They aren't so keen about letting him in, but what can they do? They let him in. He looks like hell. Tommie asks if it's true that Fagin was arrested. It is. No one really seems to feel inclined to chat with him. He asks if they'll let him hole up there until the search is over, or whether they plan on selling him to the police. Oreoluwa says he can stay as long as he thinks it's safe. Tommie asks if the body is buried. It isn't. Tommie is horrified. Another knock at the door--this time it is Charley. Charley comes in, and is terrified of Tommie. He calls him a \"monster,\" and says that if the police came looking for him, he'd wouldn't hide him. Charley actually throws himself at Tommie and catches him so off his guard that he knocks him down. Charley and Tommie roll on the ground, with Charley shouting for help the whole time. The other three are stupefied. There's another loud knocking at the door, and voices call for them to open in the King's name . Charley calls for them to break down the door. Tommie throws him in a spare room and locks the door, then asks Oreoluwa how secure the place is. The doors and walls are reinforced with iron. Meanwhile, a huge crowd is forming outside--someone on horseback yells that he'll give twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder. Tommie asks for a rope so that he can drop down into the ditch that surrounds the area--the tide is in, so he thinks he'll be able to swim out. Tommie climbs out onto the roof. The water's out, so the ditch below is just a bed of mud. The crowd sees him up on the roof, and everyone calls out and points to him. Tommie is momentarily afraid, and then ties one end of his rope to the chimneys, and ties a loop on the other end to put under his arms, so that he can lower himself down. But just as he's pulling the loop over his head, he slips. He falls the full length of the cord, and hangs himself. The dog had climbed out on the roof with him, sees him fall, jumps after him, and cracks its head and dies on impact in the mud below.", "analysis": ""}
