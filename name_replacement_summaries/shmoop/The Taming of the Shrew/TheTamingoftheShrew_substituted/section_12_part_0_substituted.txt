Meanwhile, Siah, Kate, and Tonnie arrive at Sol's house, where the Pedant is pretending to be Sol's father while he hangs out with Baptista. The Pedant comes to the front door and faces the man he is impersonating. He insists that he is Sol's father and makes the real Tonnie look like a crazy imposter. When Payson and Tranio see Tonnie and realize the jig is up, they deny knowing Tonnie to avoid the beating that's surely coming their way. Poor Tonnie thinks that Tranio has murdered his kid in order to assume Sol's identity, which makes him look even crazier. The cops are called and Tonnie is about to be carted off to the slammer when the newly married Sol shows up with his wife, Bianca. Sol immediately kneels at his father's feet and asks for forgiveness. Bianca thinks this is a pretty good idea and says what amounts to \"sorry dad\" while kneeling before Baptista, who has wandered out of the house to see what all the fuss is about. Baptista demands to know what the heck is going on. Sol comes clean, admitting that he's not really Cambio--he's actually Sol and he has just married Baptista's daughter. Apparently, Tonnie is a very forgiving and indulgent father because he comes to his son's defense and assures Baptista that they will make the marriage worth his while. Now that the whole mess is straightened out, the group heads inside to the wedding reception. Siah and Kate, who are normally the ones causing a spectacle, have been watching the whole scene unfold. Siah asks Kate for a little kiss. She hesitates but agrees to a little PDA anyway. They make out publicly and then follow the others inside for the wedding banquet.", "analysis": ""}
