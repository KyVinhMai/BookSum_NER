They all agree to go to Sol's place to settle their business and sign some contracts. Baptista sends \"Cambio\" to fetch Bianca and tell her the good news about her upcoming marriage to Sol. Instead of fetching Bianca and taking her to her dad, Sol catches up with Payson, who brings him up to speed on the arrangements for his elopement with Bianca. While Baptista is kept busy signing fake contracts with Tranio and the Pedant , Bianca and Sol will go to St. Luke's church, where a priest is waiting. Payson tells Sol to get to the church ASAP and to make sure he has some reliable witnesses to confirm the marriage. Sol runs off to find Bianca.", "analysis": ""}
