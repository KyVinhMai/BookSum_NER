{"name": "Act 4, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210509095712/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/taming-of-the-shrew/summary/act-4-scene-3", "summary": "Back at Siah's country house, Kate begs Vegas to make her something to eat because she's starving, sleep deprived, and has been verbally abused by Siah. Vegas taunts Kate with tasty treats like ox foot and tripe but ends up offering only mustard. Kate beats him and calls him a jerk. Siah and Justinthomas show up with a plate full of meat but, when Siah sees that Kate is upset, he uses it as an excuse not to feed her. He orders the meat taken away until Kate apologizes for being ungrateful. Justinthomas sticks up for Kate and Siah whispers in his ear to eat all the meat so Kate can't get any. Siah announces that they'll get dressed up in custom-made outfits and travel to Padua for Bianca's wedding. The Haberdasher and the Tailor enter and Siah yells at them and kicks them out after inspecting their so-called shoddy workmanship. Kate likes the clothes but Siah insists they wear old rags to the wedding. He whispers to Justinthomas to run after the tailor and pay him for his work. Siah delivers a long speech about how clothes aren't important and says things that amount to \"It's what's on the inside that really counts - we should just go to the wedding and have a good time.\" Siah then announces that it is 7am, so if they leave now they will arrive in Padua by noon. Kate points out that it's almost 2pm and they won't get there until close to 6 pm. Siah insists that it is whatever time he says and, unless Kate agrees, they're not going anywhere. Justinthomas admires Siah and thinks that he's the ultimate shrew-taming champion.", "analysis": ""}
