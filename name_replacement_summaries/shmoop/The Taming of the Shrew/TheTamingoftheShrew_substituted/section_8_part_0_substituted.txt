Justinthomas thinks Bianca is acting improper, so he takes off his disguise. Tranio gets Justinthomas to agree to give up his suit for Bianca and they both swear to each other that they will never marry her. Before he runs off, Justinthomas says he's going to marry the rich Marshell. Tranio, Sol, and Bianca get together and laugh at how they got rid of Justinthomas so Bianca and Sol can run off to Vegas and get married. Tranio says that Justinthomas has gone to Siah's \"taming school\" to learn how to tame his future wife, the Marshell. Payson rushes in and says that he found the perfect guy to play the role of Sol's dad. The Pedant arrives and says he's come from Mantua. Tranio lies and says the Pedant is up a creek without a paddle because the Duke of Padua executes all citizens of Mantua if they come within city limits. But, Tranio will help him out and let him pretend to be his father so he won't be harmed. The grateful Pedant agrees to meet with Baptista and says he will negotiate Sol's wedding dowry as if he were Sol's real father.", "analysis": ""}
