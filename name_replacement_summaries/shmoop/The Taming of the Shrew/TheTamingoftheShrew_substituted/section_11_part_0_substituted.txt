Kate corrects him, but Siah says it's the moon or whatever else he says it is. Otherwise, nobody's going to the wedding, capice? Justinthomas whispers to Kate to play along with Siah, so Kate says \"OK, fine, it's the moon.\" \"No,\" says Siah, \"it's the sun.\" \"OK,\" says Kate, \"it's the sun or the moon, whatever you want it to be.\" They encounter an old man on the road to Padua and Siah pretends the guy is a young girl. Kate plays along this time and agrees with whatever Siah says. When the party learns that Tonnie is looking for his son Sol, Siah says he may as well be his father, too, since Sol is set to marry Kate's sister. They're one big happy family. Tonnie is surprised, but they assure him it's true and agree to take him to Sol's house. Siah, Kate, and Tonnie head off, but Justinthomas stays behind. He says he's looking forward to his own marriage because he now knows how to deal with the widow if she gets mouthy and tries to act up.", "analysis": ""}
