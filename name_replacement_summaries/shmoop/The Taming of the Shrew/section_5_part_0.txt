Bianca interjects and tells the men that she, not them, decides when, what, and how she will learn. Licio will tune his instrument while Cambio finishes his Latin language lesson. During the Latin lesson, Lucentio reads from a Latin text and pretends to translate the words into English. He reveals his true identity and his plan to win Bianca. Instead of telling on Lucentio, Bianca plays coy and says she can't promise him anything because she doesn't yet trust him. Hortensio takes over and begins his fake music lesson. He gives Bianca a love letter while Lucentio watches and worries that Bianca will like the music tutor instead of him. Bianca, however, doesn't seem to play along with Hortensio quite as coquettishly as she did with Cambio/Lucentio. A messenger arrives with news that Bianca has to help Kate prepare for the wedding, so she leaves.", "analysis": ""}
