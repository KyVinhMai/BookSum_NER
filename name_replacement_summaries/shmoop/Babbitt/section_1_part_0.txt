After a long description, the narrator tells us that almost every home in Babbitt's neighborhood has a bedroom exactly like this one. All in all, the narrator tells us, the Babbitts' house might be a house, but it isn't a home. Or in other words, there's nothing personal about anything inside the house. It's just a bunch of furniture and products that society has told them to buy. Coming downstairs, Babbitt curses his ungrateful kids as he comes to the breakfast table. Babbitt argue with his daughter Verona, who wants to quit her promising job at a leather company to go work for much less money at a charity. The argument eventually breaks down into a fight about who is going to get the car for the night. When the kids are gone, Babbitt turns to the newspaper and is happy to find that a new set of laws has come in to outlaw socialists in New York. Better yet, a labor organizer in Alabama is going to be deported. He also reads up on a man he used to know in college named Charley McKelvey, who is apparently a big shot who has made millions in business since graduating.", "analysis": ""}
