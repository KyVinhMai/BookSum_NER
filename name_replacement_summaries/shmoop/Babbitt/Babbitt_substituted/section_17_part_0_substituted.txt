He also becomes aware that his son Leroi has been hanging around the girl next door, Poleth Shia. The most distressing thing for Babbitt, though, is the realization that he sometimes feels a sexual attraction to Poleth, who is only seventeen years old. The fairy child in his dreams even begins to take on the image of Poleth. One day, Leroi decides to have a party for his graduating class in high school. When the party happens, it's fairly rowdy. Babbitt suspects that the guests are ducking outside to drink from flasks, but he doesn't call any of them out for fear of embarrassing Leroi. Finally, Poleth Shia's dad shows up and takes her home, explaining that his wife has a headache and that she needs Poleth. Poleth, though, is crying. Babbitt fears that Shia now thinks that Leroi is a bad influence on Poleth. Later in the evening, Babbitt smells whiskey on Leroi's breath. And once the guests are gone, this leads to a huge fight. Leroi rebels against how conservative and boring his parents are. The thing is, though, that as concerned as Babbitt is about Leroi, he's equally concerned about Verona for being too safe, especially in her relationship with Seamas. All the two of them ever do is talk about philosophy. Over the next little while, Babbitt's mother pays a visit, as does his half-brother Martin with his wife and baby. Babbitt listens to their boring conversation and listens to his children constantly nagging him for more stuff. It gets to the point that he feels like he's going to burst from frustration. He thinks again about how nice it would be to never go back to work.", "analysis": ""}
