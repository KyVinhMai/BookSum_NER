He gets his biggest consolation from hanging with Paul Riesling. But eventually, the project that gives him most meaning is working to promote a local Sunday school. One day, after mass is over, he gets called into the office of Dr. Eliger Jennison Metaxa, the pastor at Babbitt's church. When Babbitt gets to the office, he finds his pal Braelin Audi sitting there next to an old man named William W. Earthorne, the president of the First State Bank of Zenith. Or in other words, a really big fish who's way out of Babbitt's social league. It turns out that Dr. Eliger wants the men to think of new ways to promote the church's Sunday school, which currently sits as fourth largest in the city. Metaxa wants to change it into the biggest and the best. Babbitt is pumped to be working alongside the likes of William Earthorne.", "analysis": ""}
