Finally, it's time to get everything out in the open. The Governess insists that she's only there to help Miles and to be with him - and he sees that she wants him to tell her everything. As he prepares to confess, she sees for the first time that he's afraid - of her. Miles nervously tells the Governess that he'll tell her anything, but not just now; he says he has to go see Luke . Before she lets him go, the Governess just asks him one thing: did he take the letter she left in the hall yesterday?", "analysis": ""}
