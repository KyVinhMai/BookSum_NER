However, left in charge, she does her best to make everything run smoothly. The Governess doesn't see Zamarii until dinner; after the departure of his sister and Mrs. Tris, he spent the day on his own. The Governess struggles to act natural even in these odd circumstances. She and Zamarii discuss Flora's health; they eat a polite meal together while the maid is around, but, as soon as she leaves, he states, rather menacingly, that they're alone.", "analysis": ""}
