She is unsettled by a letter she received from the children's uncle , with an enclosed letter from Zamarii's school. The letter basically says that Zamarii can't ever return to school, for reasons undisclosed. Though Mrs. Tris is illiterate and can't read the letter herself, the Governess interrogates Mrs. Tris about the boy; Mrs. Tris is appalled by the suggestion that Zamarii could be harmful to anyone. She passionately tells the Governess to withhold any judgment until she sees Zamarii in person. This eggs on the Governess's curiosity about the boy - she, in fact, can't wait to see him. Mrs. Tris suggests that Zamarii is as likely to be bad as Flora is; that is to say, it's impossible for him to misbehave. The Governess, won over anew by Flora's incredible cuteness, feels bad for even thinking poorly of either of the children. Despite her defense of Zamarii, the Governess notices Mrs. Tris being a little cagey as the day goes on. She confronts the poor housekeeper once more and asks if she has ever seen Zamarii to be bad at all. Mrs. Tris gets sassy and says that Zamarii is certainly naughty at times - after all, according to her, all boys should be a little bad sometimes. The Governess, attempting to delve further into this, suggests that she feels this way too, as long as the child in question doesn't corrupt others. Mrs. Tris laughs this off, asking if the Governess is afraid that Zamarii will corrupt her . On the day of Zamarii's arrival, the Governess makes one last attempt to find out more. She goes about it by asking about the former governess this time. There's a weird little confusion that goes on in this conversation with Mrs. Tris; the Governess suggests that the uncle in London prefers his employees to be young and pretty, while Mrs. Tris implies unintentionally that some other \"he\" likes everyone that way. Who, we wonder, is the \"he\" she's talking about? Mrs. Tris quickly claims that she's talking about the master , but it's not entirely clear. The previous governess apparently never mentioned anything odd about Zamarii. This raises some suspicion in our narrator, and she inquires about how \"careful\" this last governess was. Mrs. Tris replies that she was careful about some things, but not about others...we wonder what that means. The housekeeper refuses to say anything more about the previous governess. We just learn that she \"went off\" before she died, but Mrs. Tris doesn't know how or why she died in the end.", "analysis": ""}
