Dorothy sets him free, then she frees the Winkies. The Winkies are even more psyched. They've been enslaved for a long time. The Lion wishes that the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could be there. Dorothy wonders if they can be rescued. They ask the Winkies to help. The Winkies are more than happy to oblige because they're so grateful to Dorothy. A special team of Winkies heads into the forest to retrieve the Tin Woodman. He's pretty banged up. Luckily the Winkies have a whole team of tinsmiths that sets to work to restore the tin man. Soon enough he's good as new. The tin man is so happy to have come back to life that he cries. Dorothy wipes away his tears so he won't rust. Now the Winkies and the tin man set off to find the Scarecrow. They re-stuff him with new straw and he's all set. The gang hangs out in the castle for a few days before they prepare to leave for Oz. They say a tender goodbye to the Winkies, who tell the Tin Woodman they want to make him their king. On their way out the door, Dorothy sees the witch's Golden Cap and, on a whim, tries it on. It fits perfectly. Our band of travelers is off to see the Wizard once more.", "analysis": ""}
