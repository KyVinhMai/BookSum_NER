There's no road, so they don't have a good sense of direction. Everyone's starting to feel a little discouraged. They want to get back to Oz and get on with it! Toto is too depressed to chase butterflies. That's how you know it's bad. Dorothy has an idea: she's going to use a special whistle to call their old friends the field mice. They're hoping the mice can help them with directions. Here come the mice. The Queen asks how she can help, and Dorothy tells her their plight. The Queen tells them they've been walking in the wrong direction. Then she tells Dorothy she should use the Golden Cap to call the Winged Monkeys to carry them to the city. The mice peace out because they're not overly fond of the monkeys. Dorothy calls the monkeys, who agree to carry her and her friends. And they're off! Dorothy's riding with the King Monkey, so she asks him what's up with the Golden Cap. He tells her the story of the Golden Cap. Evidently his grandfather played a prank on some sorceress' betrothed. The sorceress got super mad, and the monkeys' punishment was they had to do whatever the owner of the Golden Cap asked, up to three times per owner. Eventually, the cap fell into the wicked witch's hands. She used it to enslave the Winkies, drive Oz out of the West, and attack Dorothy and her friends. Now Dorothy has the cap, which means she can call on the Winged Monkeys two more times. The story's over and so is the ride. The monkeys drop off the travelers at Emerald City and head off into the sky.", "analysis": ""}
