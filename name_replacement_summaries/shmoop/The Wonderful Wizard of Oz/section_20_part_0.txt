Soon enough, they enter a forest. The Lion's pretty excited about being in the forest. The other travelers, not so much. They make camp for the evening. The next day, the group comes upon a group of animals that are clearly having some sort of meeting. The animals see the Lion and explain what's up: there's a giant evil spider terrorizing the forest. The Lion's like, I'll kill it. No biggie. But afterwards, I want to be king. The animals agree and the Lion goes off in search of the spider. Fortunately, when he finds the beast, it is asleep, and the Lion lops off its head. Ewwww. All the animals of the forest bow down to the Lion. Long live the king.", "analysis": ""}
