On their way out, the Guardian of the Gates tells the Scarecrow that he needs to return ASAP to rule the land. Everyone's in a great mood. Toto's back to chasing butterflies, so you know all's well. They talk about Oz. Dorothy has come to the conclusion that he really was a good man. He was a terrible wizard, though. Day One goes really well. Day Two they come to a dense forest. The Scarecrow tries to enter under the branches of a big tree, but the tree wallops him good. Even so, the Scarecrow's fine. He tries to pass under another tree and gets tossed again. Dang, these trees are violent! The Tin Woodman goes back to the first tree that assaulted the Scarecrow and gives it a good hack with his axe. Everyone's able to pass into the forest without further ado. It was just that first line of trees that was the problem. When they emerge from the woods, they come to a tall, smooth wall. The tin man says he'll build a ladder. Give that man a raise!", "analysis": ""}
