Finally, they're taken to the throne. Dorothy walks the witch through everything that's happened so far, and explains that she still wants to return to Kansas. Glinda thinks that shouldn't be a problem--she just needs the Golden Cap. The plan is that Glinda will use the cap to send the Scarecrow, the tin man, and the Lion back to Oz, the Winkies, and the forest, respectively. Those are their homes now. As for Dorothy, all she has to do is use the silver shoes. She's had the power to return home this whole time; she just didn't know it. Her friends are grateful for the journey because Dorothy helped them reach their goals. But now Dorothy's ready to go home. She bids everyone a tearful goodbye and tells the shoes to take her home. Now Dorothy feels herself whirling through the air. She takes three steps and, boom! She's back in Kansas. Dorothy sees Uncle Henry and the new farmhouse he built. Toto runs for the barn, barking his head off. Dorothy stands to follow him and finds herself in her stocking feet. The silver shoes fell off along the way and are forever lost in the desert.", "analysis": ""}
