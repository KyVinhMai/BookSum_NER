What's that sound? It's the growl of a wildcat chasing a mouse. The Tin Woodman, who think it's wrong for the cat to kill the mouse, kills the cat with his axe. Whoa, he's hardcore. The mouse, having avoided death, is super grateful. And as luck would have it, she's a queen. She orders her followers to do whatever the tin man wants. Uh-oh, Toto's up from his nap. And guess what? Little dogs love chasing mice. At least, this little dog does. The mice are afraid, but the tin man grabs Toto and assures them they will come to no harm. The mice wonder if there's anything they can do for their savior the tin man. He says nah, but the Scarecrow has an idea: they can help save the Lion! As per usual, the Scarecrow's plan involves the tin man making something. This time it's a truck. Here's how it will work: thousands of mouse helpers will each attach a single string to the truck. Then they'll drag it like an insane chariot to retrieve the Lion. The plan works, and the Lion is saved. Everyone's really grateful to the mouse queen. In parting, she tells them that they can call for her whenever they need help. Everyone sits around and chills while they wait for the Lion to wake up.", "analysis": ""}
