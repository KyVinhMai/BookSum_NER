After they climb it, a strange man with no arms approaches and tells them they shall not pass. The Scarecrow's like, sorry, this is happening. And then the harmless man's head shoots out from his body and knocks the Scarecrow down the hill. Oh dear. There are hundreds of these armless guys. The tin man tells Dorothy to call the Winged Monkeys. The King agrees to carry Dorothy and her friends past the armless dudes. Then he bids her goodbye, reminding her that she has used the Golden Cap three times, so they won't meet again. The travelers are in the country of the Quadlings now, and fortunately the Quadlings are really friendly. Things are looking up. A nice family serves Dorothy and company dinner, followed by seven different kinds of dessert. They deserve it. A woman gives them directions to Glinda's place. They walk for a while, eventually happening upon a castle. Dorothy tells the guards that they want to see Glinda. They're admitted into the castle.", "analysis": ""}
