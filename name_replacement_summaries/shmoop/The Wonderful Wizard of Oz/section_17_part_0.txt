She feels like that was her last ticket to Kansas. Then again, on reflection, she thinks that maybe the balloon wasn't such a great plan. The Tin Woodman is crying for Oz like he's dead. He asks Dorothy to wipe his tears so he doesn't rust. The Scarecrow is in charge now. People like him fine, but they miss the wizard. The gang is having a meeting in the throne room to plan their next steps. Everyone's in a great mood except for Dorothy, who's still fixated on getting back to Kansas. The Scarecrow has a long think. Finally he suggests that Dorothy should call the Winged Monkeys and ask them to fly her home. Dorothy calls them and the Monkey King is like, sorry, no can do. Now Dorothy's even more bummed because she's wasted a wish. The gang calls a soldier in for a consultation. The soldier suggests that Dorothy should seek out Glinda, the Good Witch of the South. She has a great reputation for helping people. The soldier gives them directions to head south. He warns Dorothy she may encounter some dangerous creatures along the way. The Lion says he's going to travel with Dorothy so he can protect her. The Woodman says he's going, too. So does the Scarecrow. It's road trip: the sequel! Dorothy declares that they'll leave in the morning. The group disbands to get ready.", "analysis": ""}
