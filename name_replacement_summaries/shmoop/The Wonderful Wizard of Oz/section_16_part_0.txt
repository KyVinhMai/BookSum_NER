Hang in there, girl. Meanwhile, her friends are enjoying their new treasures. It's Day Four, and Oz finally sends for her. He tells her the plan: he's going to make a hot-air balloon, and they'll fly into the unknown, hoping to light upon the U.S. eventually. Dorothy's okay with the plan, so they set about making the balloon. Oz tells his kingdom that he's going to visit his brother, who lives in the clouds. They think that sounds legit. Also, he leaves the Scarecrow in charge. The balloon is about to leave, but Dorothy can't find Toto. He's off chasing a kitten in the crowd. Dorothy finds him and heads back, but she doesn't make it. The balloon takes off without her! The people are devastated because their leader is gone, and Dorothy is devastated because she missed her ride. Basically, everyone's bummed.", "analysis": ""}
