She notices her shoes are looking a bit shabby, so she decides to try on the dead witch's silver shoes. They fit perfectly. And they're off...down the yellow brick road, of course. Dorothy's feeling strangely cheerful. As she and Toto walk, they pass a lot of nice farms. Along the road, all the Munchkins bow to Dorothy. Evidently they heard about her killing the witch. It's getting late and Dorothy's wondering about where to sleep when she comes across a house. The people there are having a party and they invite her to stay for the evening. Boq, the guy who's hosting, asks Dorothy about her shoes. He thinks she must be super powerful to be wearing them. Dorothy remains unconvinced. Dorothy goes to sleep, wakes up, and passes a pleasant morning at the house. As she and Toto prepare to take off, she asks Boq how far the Emerald City is. He has no idea. He mentions that Oz has sort of a weird reputation. People tend to keep their distance. Dorothy knows this isn't good news, but she has no choice but to go anyway. Soon after she and Toto set off, Dorothy encounters a scarecrow in a field. Correction: not a scarecrow. The Scarecrow. Dorothy's a little taken aback when the Scarecrow starts talking to her, but she quickly recovers. They have a nice conversation. Dorothy helps the Scarecrow down from the pole he's attached to. As they chat, she tells him about her plan to go see Oz. The Scarecrow wants to go with her. He doesn't have any brains and he thinks Oz can help. The party of three sets off.", "analysis": ""}
