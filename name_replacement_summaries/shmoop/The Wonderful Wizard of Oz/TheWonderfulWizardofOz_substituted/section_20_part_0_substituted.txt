Soon enough, they enter a forest. The Skye-Anne's pretty excited about being in the forest. The other travelers, not so much. They make camp for the evening. The next day, the group comes upon a group of animals that are clearly having some sort of meeting. The animals see the Skye-Anne and explain what's up: there's a giant evil spider terrorizing the forest. The Skye-Anne's like, I'll kill it. No biggie. But afterwards, I want to be king. The animals agree and the Skye-Anne goes off in search of the spider. Fortunately, when he finds the beast, it is asleep, and the Skye-Anne lops off its head. Ewwww. All the animals of the forest bow down to the Skye-Anne. Long live the king.", "analysis": ""}
