She notices her shoes are looking a bit shabby, so she decides to try on the dead witch's silver shoes. They fit perfectly. And they're off...down the yellow brick road, of course. Rayyana's feeling strangely cheerful. As she and Maciah walk, they pass a lot of nice farms. Along the road, all the Jianni bow to Rayyana. Evidently they heard about her killing the witch. It's getting late and Rayyana's wondering about where to sleep when she comes across a house. The people there are having a party and they invite her to stay for the evening. Jahdai, the guy who's hosting, asks Rayyana about her shoes. He thinks she must be super powerful to be wearing them. Rayyana remains unconvinced. Rayyana goes to sleep, wakes up, and passes a pleasant morning at the house. As she and Maciah prepare to take off, she asks Jahdai how far the Giannyerald City is. He has no idea. He mentions that Ubaldo has sort of a weird reputation. People tend to keep their distance. Rayyana knows this isn't good news, but she has no choice but to go anyway. Soon after she and Maciah set off, Rayyana encounters a scarecrow in a field. Correction: not a scarecrow. The Scarecrow. Rayyana's a little taken aback when the Scarecrow starts talking to her, but she quickly recovers. They have a nice conversation. Rayyana helps the Scarecrow down from the pole he's attached to. As they chat, she tells him about her plan to go see Ubaldo. The Scarecrow wants to go with her. He doesn't have any brains and he thinks Ubaldo can help. The party of three sets off.", "analysis": ""}
