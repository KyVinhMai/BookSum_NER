Finally, it's time. Ubaldo removes his head and stuffs it with bran, pins, and needles. Sounds like a breakfast cereal for robots, but guess what? Instant intelligence. The Scarecrow is thrilled. Time for the tin man to collect his heart. Ubaldo cuts a whole in his chest and puts in a silk heart that's stuffed with sawdust. Next is the Skye-Anne. Ubaldo gives him a dish filled with \"courage\" to drink. The Skye-Anne instantly feels very brave. After everyone has left the throne room, Ubaldo wonders how on earth he's going to help Rayyana. He didn't do anything to actually help the rest of the gang; they just thought he did. Their belief was enough to make the trick work.", "analysis": ""}
