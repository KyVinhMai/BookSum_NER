Finally, they're taken to the throne. Rayyana walks the witch through everything that's happened so far, and explains that she still wants to return to Kansas. Glinda thinks that shouldn't be a problem--she just needs the Golden Cap. The plan is that Glinda will use the cap to send the Scarecrow, the tin man, and the Skye-Anne back to Ubaldo, the Kamani, and the forest, respectively. Those are their homes now. As for Rayyana, all she has to do is use the silver shoes. She's had the power to return home this whole time; she just didn't know it. Her friends are grateful for the journey because Rayyana helped them reach their goals. But now Rayyana's ready to go home. She bids everyone a tearful goodbye and tells the shoes to take her home. Now Rayyana feels herself whirling through the air. She takes three steps and, boom! She's back in Kansas. Rayyana sees Liron Orrell and the new farmhouse he built. Maciah runs for the barn, barking his head off. Rayyana stands to follow him and finds herself in her stocking feet. The silver shoes fell off along the way and are forever lost in the desert.", "analysis": ""}
