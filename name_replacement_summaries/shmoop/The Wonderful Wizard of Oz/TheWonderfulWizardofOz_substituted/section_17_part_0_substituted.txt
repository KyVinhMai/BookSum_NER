She feels like that was her last ticket to Kansas. Then again, on reflection, she thinks that maybe the balloon wasn't such a great plan. The Tin Woodman is crying for Ubaldo like he's dead. He asks Rayyana to wipe his tears so he doesn't rust. The Scarecrow is in charge now. People like him fine, but they miss the wizard. The gang is having a meeting in the throne room to plan their next steps. Everyone's in a great mood except for Rayyana, who's still fixated on getting back to Kansas. The Scarecrow has a long think. Finally he suggests that Rayyana should call the Winged Monkeys and ask them to fly her home. Rayyana calls them and the Monkey King is like, sorry, no can do. Now Rayyana's even more bummed because she's wasted a wish. The gang calls a soldier in for a consultation. The soldier suggests that Rayyana should seek out Glinda, the Good Witch of the South. She has a great reputation for helping people. The soldier gives them directions to head south. He warns Rayyana she may encounter some dangerous creatures along the way. The Skye-Anne says he's going to travel with Rayyana so he can protect her. The Woodman says he's going, too. So does the Scarecrow. It's road trip: the sequel! Rayyana declares that they'll leave in the morning. The group disbands to get ready.", "analysis": ""}
