Rayyana sets him free, then she frees the Kamani. The Kamani are even more psyched. They've been enslaved for a long time. The Skye-Anne wishes that the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could be there. Rayyana wonders if they can be rescued. They ask the Kamani to help. The Kamani are more than happy to oblige because they're so grateful to Rayyana. A special team of Kamani heads into the forest to retrieve the Tin Woodman. He's pretty banged up. Luckily the Kamani have a whole team of tinsmiths that sets to work to restore the tin man. Soon enough he's good as new. The tin man is so happy to have come back to life that he cries. Rayyana wipes away his tears so he won't rust. Now the Kamani and the tin man set off to find the Scarecrow. They re-stuff him with new straw and he's all set. The gang hangs out in the castle for a few days before they prepare to leave for Ubaldo. They say a tender goodbye to the Kamani, who tell the Tin Woodman they want to make him their king. On their way out the door, Rayyana sees the witch's Golden Cap and, on a whim, tries it on. It fits perfectly. Our band of travelers is off to see the Wizard once more.", "analysis": ""}
