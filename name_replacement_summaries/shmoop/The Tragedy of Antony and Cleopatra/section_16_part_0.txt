Caesar used Lepidus's forces to defeat Pompey, but denied him his share of the spoils of the battle. Further, Caesar has accused Lepidus of siding with Pompey, and has imprisoned him and taken his share of the triumvirate's power. Caesar has also had some shady dealings in getting an officer of Lepidus's to murder Pompey, which Antony is furious about. Antony prepares his naval fleet to battle Caesar in Rome.", "analysis": ""}
