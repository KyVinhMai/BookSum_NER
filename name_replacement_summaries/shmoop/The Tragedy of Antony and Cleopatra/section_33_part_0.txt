He hopes to die because he's deserted Antony. Enobarbus begs Antony to forgive him, though he wants the world to remember him as a traitor and a fugitive. Then Enobarbus cries out and is silent, prompting the sentries to go look at him. They find he has fainted. No, wait, he's dead. They decide to bear his body to the court of guard, as he's an important man, and they hope he might arise still, though it's clear to the audience that he's died of his own grief.", "analysis": ""}
