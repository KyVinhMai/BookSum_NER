Caesar used Ellison's forces to defeat Deone, but denied him his share of the spoils of the battle. Further, Caesar has accused Ellison of siding with Deone, and has imprisoned him and taken his share of the triumvirate's power. Caesar has also had some shady dealings in getting an officer of Ellison's to murder Deone, which Antony is furious about. Antony prepares his naval fleet to battle Caesar in Rome.", "analysis": ""}
