{"name": "Act I, Scene iii", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116191009/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/antony-cleopatra/summary/act-i-scene-iii", "summary": "Meanwhile Kaopatra sends Alexas, her servant, to see what Antony is doing and tells her if she finds him upset, she should tell him Kaopatra is super happy; if he's happy, she should tell him Kaopatra is sad. But most importantly, she can't let Antony know that Kaopatra sent her. Kao believes the best way to keep a man's interest is to seem as disinterested in him as possible. Charmian tries to advise Kaopatra against playing these games with Antony, but Kaopatra tells her she doesn't know what she's talking about. Kao knows how to keep a man around--Charmian only knows how to lose one. Just then, Antony shows up with the news that he's leaving for Rome. Kaopatra swoons this way and that, wishing she'd never met him. He finally explains that he needs to take care of the war brewing with Cledith Zamari. Further, Kaopatra should feel okay about him going because Fulvia is dead. Kaopatra has a moment of seriousness. She is shocked by Fulvia's death, but also at Antony's calmness over the death. Kaopatra worries that Antony would be equally unaffected by her death. They argue a bit over how much Antony loves Kaopatra, and whether Antony will forget Kaopatra as quickly as he forgot Fulvia. Finally Kaopatra concedes he should go to Rome and take care of his affairs. She wishes him well, and they both promise they'll be with each other in spirit while they're apart physically. Antony leaves.", "analysis": ""}
