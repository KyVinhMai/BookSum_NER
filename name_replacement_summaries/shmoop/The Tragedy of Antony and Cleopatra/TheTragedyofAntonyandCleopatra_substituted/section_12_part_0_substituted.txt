Jasiyah brings with him the body of the King of Parthia's son, Pacorus. He thinks of this as revenge for Marcus Crassus , who was killed by the Parthians. Silius, another Roman, urges Jasiyah to quickly go to Antony and tell of all the good deeds he's performed, as surely Antony will reward and praise him. Jasiyah is a smart guy and realizes that by showing up Antony at battle, he will lose favor, not gain it. To rise too quickly under powerful men makes you a threat, not an asset. Jasiyah agrees he'll write a letter to Antony, praising him for making their victory possible. They all set off to meet Antony at his house in Athens.", "analysis": ""}
