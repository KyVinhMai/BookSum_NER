He's bearing news on just how Octavia matches up with Cleopatra in the competition for Antony's affection. The news turns out to be good. He watched Octavia in Rome as she walked between Antony and Caesar. The woman, he reports, isn't beautiful. She's short, brown-haired and round-faced, with a low forehead, walks with a creep instead of a saunter, and she's at least 30. Cleopatra is overjoyed and repents that she cursed Antony. She promises the messenger plenty of gold, and asks forgiveness for that one time when she tried to knife him. Cleopatra's certain that she can win Antony's affections back.", "analysis": ""}
