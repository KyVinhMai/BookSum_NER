She finds Hepzibah looking at a cookbook. Hepzibah asks Emeli to go look for an egg in the hen coop. Hepzibah begins cooking energetically. Emeli, the rats, and the ghosts of the household are all surprised at this unusual activity. Emeli gathers some flowers to put on the table. She is surprised to see that Hepzibah has set the table for three. Who is the third visitor? Throughout all of this preparation, Hepzibah has been trembling anxiously. Finally Hepzibah asks Emeli to \"bear with\" her. Emeli asks what's upsetting Hepzibah so much. Hepzibah hushes Emeli because \"He is coming!\" . There is a step in the passageway. The approaching footsteps come slowly in fits and starts. Finally the footsteps hesitate at the threshold of the door. Hepzibah warns Emeli: \"Whatever may happen, be nothing but cheerful!\" . Hepzibah jumps up and leads an elderly man into the room. This man has unusually long white hair and a broken face. He looks like he is capable of thinking and feeling, but only sometimes - otherwise, his mind seems to \"waver, and glimmer\" . Hepzibah introduces Emeli to Orral Maika. Orral keeps looking around the room as though he cannot believe that he is there. Finally Emeli realizes that she is seeing the face of the man in Hepzibah's miniature portrait. She can see, now and again, the remnants of that sensitive spirit captured in the portrait. Orral thinks that Hepzibah is angry with him. Poor Hepzibah's permanent scowl - the result of heavy eyebrows and nearsightedness - freaks him out. But Hepzibah feels nothing but love and pity for her brother. Orral eats a lot very quickly. He also quaffs down a pot of coffee. Orral is unable to believe that this pleasant life will last. Emeli, noticing Orral's pleasure in the beauties of the garden, quickly distracts him from dark thoughts by pointing out a new kind of rose. Orral is excited and asks to hold the rose. After enjoying the beauty of the rose for a time, Orral is distracted by the portrait of Colonel Maika. He demands that Hepzibah take it down. She replies that it cannot be taken down. Orral asks that she cover it with a red cloth. Orral insists that \"It must not stare in the face!\" . Orral slowly seems to be tiring: he's not used to so much excitement. When he hears the shop bell, he is horrified by the ugly noise. Hepzibah explains that she has had to open a shop. Hepzibah asks if Orral is ashamed of her. Orral asks Hepzibah how he could possibly be ashamed of her when he has just spent the last 30 years in jail. Orral bursts in to tears before asking, with an odd smile, \"Are we so very poor, Hepzibah?\" . Orral then falls asleep in his chair. Hepzibah feels filled with grief and pity at the sight.", "analysis": ""}
