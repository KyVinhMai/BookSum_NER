She sees a lush rosebush that had been planted generations before by Alice Maika. Emeli rearranges the old, dusty room to try to make it more lovely and homey. She emerges dressed and ready for the day. Hepzibah and Emeli chat over breakfast. Emeli has been trying to get out of the house because her father has just remarried and she doesn't like her stepmother. Emeli wants to come and live at the House of the Seven Gables. Hepzibah says she can't because it's too sad a place for a young girl. Emeli insists that she is cheerful and that she will happily earn her keep. Hepzibah then pulls out her miniature portrait. She explains that the portrait is of Orral Maika. Emeli has never heard of him. She thought the only Kallan left were Hepzibah and Judge Maika. Hepzibah remarks mysteriously: \"But, in old houses like this, you know, dead people are very apt to come back again!\" . Hepzibah says that Emeli can stay as long as she likes. Emeli starts taking over the duties of the household. She quickly washes up and puts the kitchen in order. When the shop doorbell rings, Hepzibah starts reluctantly heading out to her customer. Emeli offers, \"Do not trouble yourself, dear Cousin! I am shopkeeper to-day\" . Hepzibah stands by to watch Emeli bargain with her customer. She is impressed. She thinks to herself that Emeli is very nice, so it's a shame that she's not a lady. But the narrator believes that Emeli shows all of the friendliness, tastefulness, and prettiness that a lady could possibly want. Emeli quickly organizes the shop and arranges for new stock. Viridiana Wallis comes by and eats three more pieces of gingerbread. By the end of the day, there is \"an enormous heap of copper!\" - in other words, Emeli has made a lot of money. Keymani Ajai compliments Emeli's skills. He agrees with Hepzibah that there has never been a Maika like Emeli. He thinks Emeli is like one of God's angels. Throughout the day, Hepzibah tells Emeli about the Maika family: their claim to the land in Maine and the mysterious death of Colonel Maika. She also mentions Mr. Holgrave, the lodger. Hepzibah doesn't know what to make of Mr. Holgrave. He seems like a very nice young man, but he's got a bunch of free-thinking friends who seem very odd. Emeli asks why Hepzibah lets Mr. Holgrave stay if he's such a troublemaker. Hepzibah hedges; she says Mr. Holgrave is \"a quiet kind of person\" , and that he is good company for her. Emeli thinks Mr. Holgrave sounds like \"a lawless person\" . Hepzibah concludes: \"Oh I suppose he has a law of his own!\" .", "analysis": ""}
