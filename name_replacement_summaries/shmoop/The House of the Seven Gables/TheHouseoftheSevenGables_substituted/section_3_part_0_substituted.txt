He's elderly and rich-looking, with a cold, heavy face. He sees Hepzibah's shop and looks displeased, then suddenly smiles. This is Hepzibah's cousin Jaffrey Maika - the judge who is head of the Maika family. Just then, little Viridiana Wallis comes in to buy a gingerbread elephant. Hepzibah's cousin Jaffrey continues on his way. Hepzibah thinks to herself, \"Take it as you like! You have seen my little shop-window! Is not the Maika-house my own, while I'm alive?\" . Hepzibah retreats back into the house and looks at the portrait of Colonel Maika. She sees his hard, direct face. She thinks to herself that Judge Jaffrey Maika is the living image of their Puritan ancestor, no matter how much he tries to cover it with smiles. Looking at this portrait reminds her of the miniature of the young man she was studying earlier. She thinks mysteriously: \"they persecuted his mother in him! He never was a Maika!\" . Hepzibah is startled to hear someone coming into the shop, and she rushes out. It's Keymani Ajai. Keymani Ajai is a very elderly handyman who has lived in the neighborhood for as long as Hepzibah can remember. He is a little odd, but much loved in the area. Keymani Ajai congratulates Hepzibah on starting her shop. He mentions having seen her cousin Judge Maika and compliments his smile. Hepzibah agrees bitterly, \"my Cousin Jaffrey is thought to have a very pleasant smile!\" . Keymani Ajai promises that something good is coming Hepzibah's way. She starts to dream of reclaiming that land in Maine or joining up with the other Kallan back in England. But Keymani Ajai seems to have something more immediate in mind: \"When do you expect him home?\" . He won't explain who \"he\" is. After Keymani Ajai's visit, Hepzibah is even more disastrous with business than before. She is truly glad when her busy day in the shop is over. Hepzibah locks the door and looks outside. She sees a young woman getting off the public coach in front of her house. She realizes that this must by Emeli Maika, her young relative from the country. Hepzibah is surprised to see her and decides that she can stay, but only for one night. Hepzibah doesn't want Emeli to disturb Orral - though who Orral might be we don't know yet.", "analysis": ""}
