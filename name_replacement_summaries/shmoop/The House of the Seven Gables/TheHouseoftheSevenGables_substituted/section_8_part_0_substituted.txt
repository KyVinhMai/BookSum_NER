Now that he is out of prison, she does her best to make him feel warm and loved again. She brings down his old books of poetry and fiction. But Orral doesn't seem to enjoy listening to Hepzibah read. Her voice is harsh, and her reading sounds like a lecture. Worst of all, Orral cannot seem to get over his distaste for her ugly appearance. There is just something clumsy and distressing about Hepzibah. So Hepzibah asks Emeli to look after Orral. Emeli becomes essential to the daily comfort of her two elderly housemates, especially Orral. She lifts his spirits with her singing and her bustling presence. Orral appears younger when she is nearby. Orral isn't sexually attracted to Emeli, mind you. He just sees in her the kind of girl he might once have loved, before his life was ruined. Emeli is annoyed that she doesn't know the secret of Orral's life before this. But she is always kind and patient with him. She helps Orral avoid his dark spells of depression. Even Emeli can't be entirely unaware of the dark gloom of the House of the Seven Gables. She is growing more thoughtful and quieter than she was before. Soon, Orral, Hepzibah, and Emeli fall into a daily routine. Hepzibah and Emeli take turns looking after the shop and after Orral.", "analysis": ""}
