She has a feeling that something new, something unprecedented in the Maika family history, is about to take place. Hepzibah is sure that Judge Jaffrey Maika will destroy Orral. She is also sure that Orral has no access to the secret Judge Maika believes he holds. She has nowhere to turn for help. Who would side with Orral against well-respected Judge Jaffrey Maika? She thinks of going to Mr. Holgrave, but he's not there. She looks out the arched window at the sky and sends up a prayer, but she doesn't feel any response. At last Hepzibah goes to knock on Orral's door. No one answers. Hepzibah asks if she can come in. She finds Orral's room empty. Hepzibah looks down into the garden to see if Orral has gone out somehow. She sees \"a strange grimalkin\" - meaning an old house cat - walking across the garden. Hepzibah throws a stick at it to frighten it away. But still, Hepzibah cannot see Orral. She can't imagine that he would have run away - he would be treated so badly by the public! Hepzibah suddenly wonders whether Orral might have decided to end it all and throw himself into the sea. Hepzibah is so frightened by the thought that she runs to Judge Maika. She begs Judge Maika to help her. She finds him sitting in that chair in the parlor - the same chair, supposedly, where Colonel Maika was found dead 150 years before. Judge Maika doesn't move, even when Hepzibah screams, \"Do you hear me, Jaffrey Maika?\" . Orral walks into the parlor. He looks crazy. His face is filled with a wild expression of \"scorn and mockery\" . Orral tells Hepzibah that they can dance now - they can do whatever they like. Hepzibah realizes that Judge Jaffrey Maika is dead. Orral suggests that they leave the House of the Seven Gables. After all, Judge Maika \"will take good care of it!\" . Hepzibah is in such a panic that she agrees without question. She grabs her cloak and follows Orral. She keeps thinking that she will awake from this dream, but she never does. And so Orral and Hepzibah leave the House of the Seven Gables. Inside, Judge Maika's body is sitting by himself \"in the old home of his forefathers\" .", "analysis": ""}
