She reads to Orral outside, choosing from Mr. Holgrave's fiction and poetry collection. Orral still doesn't think much of fiction, but he does enjoy the poetry, with its rhythmic language. Even more than Emeli's reading, though, Orral enjoys listening her talk. Emeli chats about the garden and the flowers that are blooming. Mr. Holgrave plants a row of scarlet runner beans, whose red flowers attract hummingbirds. Orral feels so happy to watch them that he becomes like \"a child again\" . Hepzibah sometimes cries when she sees Orral's excitement because she can remember him just like this as a child. The narrator wants to give one anecdote of the garden life Orral and Emeli share. Emeli often talks about the chickens to entertain Orral. They are all rather amusing looking: there is one rooster, two hens, and one tiny, ancient-looking chick. One of the hens has a great deal of trouble laying an egg, but she finally manages it. Without a thought for the feelings of the hen, Hepzibah takes the egg to make Orral's breakfast. The next day, the rooster and the hen stand in front of Orral and caw angrily in revenge. They stop only when Emeli offers them a piece of spice cake. The narrator explains that he's telling this trivial story as one example of the kind of ordinary event that was so good for Orral's health. Orral also gets into the habit of looking into Maule's well. He says he sees beautiful faces there. But every now and then Orral will yell, \"The dark face gazes at me!\" and run away. On Sundays after church, Emeli, Orral, Hepzibah, Keymani Ajai, and Mr. Holgrave have little parties in the garden. Orral quite enjoys being younger than someone for once - in this case, Keymani Ajai. One afternoon Keymani Ajai says that he expects life after he retires on his farm will be a lot like these Sunday afternoons. Orral makes the strange comment that Keymani Ajai \"is always talking about his farm. But I have a better scheme for him, by and by. We shall see!\" . Hepzibah asks Emeli to help her gather the currants. Mr. Holgrave falls into conversation with Orral. Orral really starts to cheer up. But as the sun sets, he gets gloomy again. He whispers, \"I want my happiness! Many, many years have I waited for it! It is late!\" . But, the narrator tells us, that happiness isn't going to come to Orral, unless it's the happiness of sitting in the garden with his family.", "analysis": ""}
