{"name": "Chapter XVI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210103175047/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/what-maisie-knew/summary/chapter-xvi", "summary": "The Captain surprises Maisie by telling her that he has heard a lot about her and that her mother is \"an angel\" . According to the Captain, Ida Farange is just misunderstood but really wild about her daughter. Even though Maisie long ago realized that her mother isn't wild about her--and really doesn't care about her at all--this announcement from the Captain moves her. The Captain emphasizes what a hard time Ida has had, and Maisie is moved to pity when she realizes that this is the first time she's heard anyone say anything nice about her mother at all. Maisie asks the Captain if he loves her mother, and now it's his turn to be startled. But, he says he does love her. Maisie says she does, too, and then tells the Captain that if he loves her mother, he shouldn't be \"like the others\" but should love Ida \"always\" . The Captain says that Maisie should live with her mother and that he'll join them eventually. Sir Claude returns and asks Maisie what the Captain has said and who he is. Maisie feigns ignorance as she has learned to do; she pretends not to have paid attention to the Captain and not to have found out who he is. Sir Claude responds angrily, calling Maisie an idiot, putting her into a cab, and sending her away, alone.", "analysis": ""}
