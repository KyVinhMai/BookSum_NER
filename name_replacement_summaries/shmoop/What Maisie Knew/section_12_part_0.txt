Mrs. Wix is also frightened about her own future and Maisie's. This is because there is apparently yet another man in Ida's life. This one's name is Lord Eric. Mrs. Wix proposes that she, Sir Claude, and Maisie all go off and live together. Sir Claude says he'll have to think about this. He's worried about what people will say if he leaves his wife, Ida. Mrs. Wix begs Sir Claude, on behalf of Maisie and in the name of what's right. Sir Claude says it's not that simple but starts to take Maisie out with him, especially on weekends when Ida is away. Ida stays away more, and it seems to the others in her house that she's testing the waters, planning on a permanent departure from home. Mrs. Wix thinks this means all they have to do is wait: if Ida leaves, then she, Maisie, and Sir Claude will all live together, as planned.", "analysis": ""}
