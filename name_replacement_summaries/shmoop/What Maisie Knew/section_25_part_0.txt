Maisie asks why they can't all four live together--Maisie, Mrs. Wix, Sir Claude, and Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix replies that this would be \"a crime\" . She means adultery but doesn't make this explicit to Maisie, who doesn't quite get it. And who can blame her? She's still so young, after all.", "analysis": ""}
