{"name": "Chapter IX", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210103175047/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/what-maisie-knew/summary/chapter-ix", "summary": "Maisie finds that she has a lot of schoolwork to make up, and Mrs. Wix, who's thrilled to have her back, sets to work to help her. Maisie's mother, Mrs. Farange , refuses to see Maisie for three days after her return. Mrs. Wix tries to make Maisie feel better by saying it's because her mother is in love, and, ever the romantic, she tells little Maisie stories about love's \"ravages\" . Maisie does not reveal to her mother, when she finally sees her, that Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale seemed to like each other very much. Time passes. Sir Claude leaves occasionally for a few days at a time. He seems to be out on the town--\"in society,\" as they'd say in James's day--but he always comes back with gifts for both Maisie and Mrs. Wix. Sir Claude is clearly very fond of both of them. And they are, of course, very fond of him, too. Mrs. Wix takes to spending evenings chatting with Maisie about his charms. She feels a bit awkward doing so but figures Maisie has already seen and heard it all. During one of these talks, Mrs. Wix and Maisie both say they're in love with Sir Claude. But months go by, and they haven't seen Sir Claude much at all. Both he and his new wife are off partying. Maisie learns from Mrs. Wix that Mrs. Beale has been trying to see her, and that this has enraged Maisie's mother. Sir Claude sides with Mrs. Beale, which only makes Ida more upset.", "analysis": ""}
