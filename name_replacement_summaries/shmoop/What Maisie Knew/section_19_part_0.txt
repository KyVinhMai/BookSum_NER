She initially accepts the invitation, and her father says it's hers to take or leave. While Maisie waits with Beale for the Countess to appear, she and her father discuss her mother and her future. Beale seems to have finally gotten tired of bad-mouthing his ex-wife. But, he has nothing but awful things to say about Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude. When Maisie says that she plans to live with the two of them, Beale says they have made her into \"a monster\" . When the Countess appears after a long wait, her ugliness horrifies Maisie, and she wants to run away, even though the Countess is perfectly nice. This confirms Maisie's sense that she can't possibly go with her father, even though this means she will never see him again. The Countess gives Maisie cab fare as she's leaving.", "analysis": ""}
