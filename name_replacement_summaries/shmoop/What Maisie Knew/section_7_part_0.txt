Miss Overmore can't even. She really hates Mrs. Wix and all that she stands for, including Mrs. Farange. But Mrs. Wix holds her own, fights back with some surprisingly sharp words, and manages to give Maisie the message she has come to give: that her mother will marry a man named Sir Claude. Mrs. Wix also shows Maisie a picture of the man in question, and little Maisie is very, very impressed by the looks of her soon-to-be stepfather. Maisie convinces Mrs. Wix to give her the picture, and Mrs. Wix parts with it reluctantly. Out of nowhere, Miss Overmore announces that she, too, has just gotten married: to Mr. Farange.", "analysis": ""}
