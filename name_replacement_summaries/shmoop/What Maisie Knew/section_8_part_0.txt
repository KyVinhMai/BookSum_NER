Maisie realizes that she now has four parents in total. Maisie's studies are neglected; \"untutored and unclaimed,\" she spends most of her time at home, listening to grown-ups live it up downstairs . A maid named Susan Ash starts taking Maisie out for walks. Returning from one of these walks, Maisie finds Sir Claude waiting for her at her father's place. Maisie thinks, meeting Sir Claude, that he is the most beautiful thing she has ever seen. Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale get along swimmingly--which is odd, given that their spouses are bitter enemies. Mrs. Beale, Sir Claude, and Maisie all agree that Maisie has brought the two stepparents together. Here, James uses still more foreshadowing. Maisie goes home to her mother's with Sir Claude.", "analysis": ""}
