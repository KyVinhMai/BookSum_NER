After the impersonal preface, James's narrator shows us what it feels like to be Maisie, and the novel will remain close to her point of view throughout . In short, Maisie has got a tough life ahead of her. Beale Farange doesn't hide his anger for her benefit and bad-mouths Maisie's mother in front of his daughter on the regular. We also meet Maisie's babysitter, Moddle . Moddle is always telling Maisie what a bad pair her parents are . Moddle promises Maisie that things will be better when she goes to stay with her mother. But the chapter ends with Maisie repeating an insult per her father's request, one that's sure to get Ida Farange's goat: \"'He said I was to tell you, from him,' she faithfully reported, 'that you're a nasty, horrid pig!'\" . Ouch.", "analysis": ""}
