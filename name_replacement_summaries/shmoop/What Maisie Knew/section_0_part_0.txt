There has been a long--almost \"interminable\"--court case, and it ends, after some complications involving money, with a verdict that grants shared custody to Ida and Beale Farange, Maisie's parents . So, by order of the court, each parent takes her \"in rotation, for six months at a time,\" and James gives readers a taste of what's in store for Maisie: lots of change and confusion . The confusion will be caused by the role Maisie will be made to play, which the narrator already spells out: she will be \"a vessel for bitterness\"; she will act as a go-between for the divorced Faranges, who want Maisie \"not for any good they could do her, but for the harm they could, with her unconscious aid, do to each other\" . Poor Maisie! Before the preface ends, James offers some exposition that gives readers the scoop on the social world that the Faranges live in. Turns out, it's a very, very shallow one. We're also treated to some description of both parents, which makes it clear that they're shallow as well--shallow and pretty poor. Mrs. Farange likes to play pool, which isn't very ladylike of her. Little Maisie, though, is \"provided for\" because a great aunt whom we never meet has left her with just enough .", "analysis": ""}
