Back at Mrs. Beale's, a debate about what to do with the extra money ensues. Susan Ash, the maid who sometimes looks after Maisie, pockets some. Mrs. Beale insists on giving all of the extra money back. Sir Claude takes Maisie and Susan Ash to Folkestone, a city on England's southeast coast, on the English Channel. Here, Maisie is able to put a lot of the puzzle pieces together. She is getting smarter by the day. Sir Claude has taken her to Folkestone to go along with Mrs. Wix's plan, Maisie thinks. It seems like Mrs. Wix's urging of Sir Claude to do the right thing has finally made a difference. Maisie is sad that Mrs. Wix herself hasn't yet appeared, but she expects to see her again any day. All of a sudden, Maisie's mother, Ida, appears out of nowhere. Ida tells Sir Claude that she wants to talk to Maisie alone.", "analysis": ""}
