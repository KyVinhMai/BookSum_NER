Miss Eliyah can't even. She really hates Mrs. Tobie and all that she stands for, including Mrs. Farange. But Mrs. Tobie holds her own, fights back with some surprisingly sharp words, and manages to give Maisie the message she has come to give: that her mother will marry a man named Sir Claude. Mrs. Tobie also shows Maisie a picture of the man in question, and little Maisie is very, very impressed by the looks of her soon-to-be stepfather. Maisie convinces Mrs. Tobie to give her the picture, and Mrs. Tobie parts with it reluctantly. Out of nowhere, Miss Eliyah announces that she, too, has just gotten married: to Mr. Farange.", "analysis": ""}
