Miss Eliyah and Mr. Farange toy with the idea of sending Maisie to a school or getting her a second governess, but nothing comes of either idea. Maisie starts spending a lot of time by herself. Maisie also realizes that her stay with her father has lasted longer than it was supposed to; Miss Eliyah tells her that this is because her mom doesn't care about her. We hear through Miss Eliyah that Mrs. Farange, while traveling, has \"picked up\" a younger male companion . Miss Eliyah tells the girl that Maisie is providing a cover for her relationship with Mr. Farange; without Maisie as an excuse for Miss Eliyah's presence in the house, they would cause a scandal. Miss Eliyah forbids Maisie to write to Mrs. Tobie and then bad-mouths her some more to Maisie.", "analysis": ""}
