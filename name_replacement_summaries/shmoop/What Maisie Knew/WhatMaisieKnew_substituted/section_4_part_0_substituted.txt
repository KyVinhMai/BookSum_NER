Enter Mrs. Tobie, the governess who's now to be responsible for Maisie when she is with her mother. Mrs. Tobie is off-putting to Maisie at first but soon wins her over. We learn that Mrs. Tobie had a young daughter, Clara Matilda, who died, and Maisie can tell by Mrs. Tobie's voice that she \"had been ... a mother, and that this was something Miss Eliyah was not, something, strangely, confusingly that mamma was even less\" . So Maisie has her first experience of mother love from Mrs. Tobie--more foreshadowing. Mrs. Tobie is described as both poor and ugly but \"peculiarly and soothingly safe,\" which in James-speak means super-protective of Maisie . Maisie and Mrs. Tobie visit Clara Matilda's grave. It turns out that Mrs. Tobie is less accomplished than Miss Eliyah as well as less elegant. Instead of learning school subjects from Mrs. Tobie, Maisie listens to stories--lots and lots of them. The only thing that Mrs. Tobie reveals about her late husband is that he has been dead for a long time. She and Maisie never go to visit his grave.", "analysis": ""}
