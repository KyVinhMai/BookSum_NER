{"name": "Chapter X", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210103175047/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/what-maisie-knew/summary/chapter-x", "summary": "Maisie and Sir Claude have a heart-to-heart. Sir Claude drops lots of vague hints. Maisie reminds him that she has brought him and Mrs. Beale together, and he hints at his marital difficulties. Sir Claude also tells Maisie that she won't be apart from him when she goes back to live with her father and Mrs. Beale, even though they won't all be living in the same place. This is almost as confusing for the reader as it is for Maisie; Sir Claude is being cagey, and none of what he's saying makes much sense. Sir Claude says that Mrs. Wix doesn't approve of Mrs. Beale, and Maisie starts to suspect that he's hiding something, although she can't yet say what it is.", "analysis": ""}
