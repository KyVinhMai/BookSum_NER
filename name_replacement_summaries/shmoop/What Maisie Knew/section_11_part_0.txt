Maisie senses that \"something beyond her knowledge had taken place in the house.\" Then, she realizes \"that her mother was no longer in love\" . There is a new man in Ida's life, and Maisie soon meets him: a millionaire named Mr. Perriam, who visits Ida's house while Sir Claude is away. Maisie tries to figure out who is on her side and realizes that her stepparents and Mrs. Wix are looking out for her, but her biological parents aren't. Our heroine also has the feeling that things are about to change. Sir Claude and Mrs. Wix start to have late-night conversations, during which the \"perfect gentleman\" asks his friend the governess for advice about how to get out of the bad marriage he's in . Mrs. Wix and Maisie fantasize about getting Sir Claude into Parliament, and Mrs. Wix tells Maisie that this will be just the thing needed to \"save\" Sir Claude . Maisie asks what Sir Claude needs to be saved from, and Mrs. Wix responds: \"awful misery\" .", "analysis": ""}
