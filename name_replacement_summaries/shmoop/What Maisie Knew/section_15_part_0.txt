We learn that he has broken his promise and hasn't been to visit Maisie much. Even though Maisie's mother is supposed to be away playing pool in Brussels, she appears in the park with a man. The man she's with isn't one we've heard about before; it's neither Mr. Perriam nor Lord Eric, nor someone called the \"Count.\" The man in question is the \"Captain,\" and Maisie is told to go talk to him while Ida and Sir Claude have it out.", "analysis": ""}
