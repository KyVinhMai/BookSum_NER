Mr. Rigby, the bosun, yells at her to keep going. There's no navel gazing in combat drills--only naval gazing. Turns out Deryn has already passed the middy's test to become a midshipman while on board the Leviathan--also, no one has yet noticed that she's a girl. Now she's training with the other middies to learn all about living, fighting, and dying on an airbeast, and about how Darwin used evolution to learn to fabricate new animals. No matter what kind of strange stuff Deryn's learning, the weirdest thing of all is learning to be a boy. Deryn finally reaches the top of the airbeast, and she and Mr. Newkirk, another midshipman, rest and observe the airship. Mr. Newkirk's mother is a Monkey Luddite, a person who is afraid of fabrications, and he's a little freaked by them himself. She and Newkirk give each other a hard time, and Deryn thinks that being a boy is pretty tough.", "analysis": ""}
