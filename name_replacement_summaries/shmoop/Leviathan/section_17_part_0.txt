Six small single-man walkers chase after Alek, shooting phosphorus flares. Alek's crew doesn't understand what's going on until one of the phosphorus flares sticks to the walker--the flare sends constant smoke into the air, making them very easy to track. Uh oh. Because there's no easy way to put out phosphorus, the guys aren't sure what to do until Alek realizes he'll have to hack it off. Which he does, with a two-hundred-year-old family heirloom sword they just happen to have on board. Why is that sword there? We don't know. Then Alek throws the sword into the forest because it's smoking phosphorus. We just hate when that happens to our good swords. Because the Germans believe the smoking sword is the fallen walker, they keep firing at it while Alek and his crew escape.", "analysis": ""}
