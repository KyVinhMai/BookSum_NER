Dylan and Alek get into a tiff, but then they make up and Dylan explains a lot about the airship. Then they get into another tiff about which is better: machines or fabricated beasts. The two of them check the temperature of the eggs, grab the supplies Dylan left in the machine room earlier, and head to the sick bay. Dylan thanks Alek for saving him from frostbite--in a roundabout way, of course. On the way to sick bay, Dylan and Alek talk about how important Alek thinks he is, and Dylan reveals that his mother didn't want him to be a soldier. All this bickering and sharing of confidences means the two are well on their way to becoming friends.", "analysis": ""}
