Deryn and Newkirk are now the only two middies on board, due to Dr. Barlow and all the extra weight she brought, so Deryn now spends a ton of time showing Dr. Barlow around and generally seeing to her needs. Meanwhile, everyone thinks Britain will be in the war by the next day. While flying over the Swiss Alps, Deryn and Dr. Barlow go into the gut of the whale, where the bee colonies are. As they examine the bees, Dr. Barlow tells Deryn that her grandfather loved to study bees and picks up on one of Deryn's secrets--she's not sixteen yet, so she's too young to enlist in the Air Service. They hear the general alarm ringing, signaling the fact that Britain and Germany are now at war.", "analysis": ""}
