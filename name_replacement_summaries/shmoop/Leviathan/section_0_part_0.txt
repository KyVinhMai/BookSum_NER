Then we find out that those forces are Prince Aleksander's desk accessories set up for a mock battle--and here we thought decorating our lockers was cool. Prince Aleksander is having to make do with pens and ink bottles because his parents left him at home while they went to watch military maneuvers. Weak. But wait... Prince Aleksander hears noises in the hall and sneaks back to his bed to pretend to be asleep. Is it an assassin? A thief? Nope, it's just Otto Klopp, his master of mechaniks, and Count Volger, his fencing master. The two men tell Prince Aleksander to come with them for some nighttime training exercises in his walker, which is not something little babies and old people use, but a sweet war machine. They all sneak out of the palace--something we at Shmoop do all the time . As they're getting their sneak on, Alek reflects on his position: because his mother isn't royal, his parents' marriage doesn't count. This means that Alek will never be able to inherit his father's lands and titles unless he defies his great-uncle, the emperor. First world problems, right? Oh, and Volger, as a noble, doesn't really respect Alek the way commoners like Klopp do.", "analysis": ""}
