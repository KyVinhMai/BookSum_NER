{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-22", "summary": "At first, Alek thinks it's a German zeppelin, but Volger disagrees--and then they both realize it's a Darwinist airship. The airship glides overhead, clearly wounded and crashing; Alek watches the slow crash. Volger starts thinking of how to remain hidden, and Alek starts thinking of how to help the wounded airship--which is perhaps our first indication that staying hidden isn't going to be Alek's strong suit. Volger and Alek argue--as is their way--about whether or not they should help the wounded airbeast and its crew. After a cold dinner , Alek volunteers for first watch. Instead of watching though, Alek gets some supplies and sets out on foot for the wreck. When he arrives at the airship, he's shocked by the smell of so many living and dying organisms. Then he hears a moan and helps a wounded airman wake up and provides some first aid. Alek tells the boy he lives in a village nearby, and the boy introduces himself as Midshipman Dylan Sharp. And so the plot thickens, Shmoopsters.", "analysis": ""}
