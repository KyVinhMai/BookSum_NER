Uh-oh... They decide the only way to get past it is to try to sneak by at night--because everyone thinks piloting a walker at night is too dangerous. The land frigate sends out searchlights at random intervals, which they have to sneak by. They try disguising the walker's noise by walking in a loud streambed. Pretty smart thinking. They run right into some German soldiers on foot, but the walker manages to plow through them. Alek speeds up, taking the walker into a run--at night.", "analysis": ""}
