Deryn realizes the whale is adapting to the new Clanker engines, using them to evolve. The all-hands-aft signal sounds, and everyone runs to the tail to try to pitch the nose of the ship up. She feels the airship become suddenly lighter , which means it just misses being hit by the German guns. The ship flies out of range, and Deryn tells Newkirk the Germans won't be able to catch them now: Clanker engines on Darwinist fabrications are more powerful than either one alone.
