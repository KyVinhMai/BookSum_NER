Dylan reveals that the First Lord of the Admiralty is concerned about the Clankers aboard, and we learn that Dr. Barlow and Winston Churchill really don't get along, especially on issues concerning the Ottoman Empire. Dr. Barlow says that if Churchill finds out Alek is aboard, he'll turn the ship around and her mission will be over. Alek asks how Dr. Barlow can guarantee Dylan's safety, and she says she's Nora Darwin Barlow--the Darwin's granddaughter. In other words, she's pretty important. Dylan leaves to take Tazza for a walk, while Alek remains behind, wondering what's in those mysterious eggs.", "analysis": ""}
