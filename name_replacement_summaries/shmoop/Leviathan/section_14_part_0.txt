Because she's already seen London from the air in her wild Huxley ride, she's pretty chill about it. Deryn and Midshipman Fitzroy, who's kind of a jerk, get into it, until Mr. Rigby comes in with Captain Hobbes and Dr. Busk, the ship's head scientist. The captain tells them they'll be setting the ship down in the middle of London to pick up an important person to take to Constantinople; Deryn wonders why they'd be doing something so silly as transporting a scientist to Constantinople when Britain will be at war any day. The scientist will be bringing some heavy equipment aboard, which equals some midshipmen being left behind. Deryn and Fitzroy glare at each other, and Deryn tells herself that she's one of the best on board, so as long as she doesn't screw up anything during the landing process she should be fine. As they prepare to land, Deryn free-balloons to the ground in another Huxley, carrying a message lizard. She worries that if she's left behind, she'll lose the place that's come to feel like home. Deryn lands, accepts compliments from the ground men on her landing, and delivers the message lizard to the constable directing the landing from the ground. She notes that she beat Fitzroy down. Take that, Fitzroy. It's Deryn's job to get the scientist aboard, so she heads for the zoo.", "analysis": ""}
