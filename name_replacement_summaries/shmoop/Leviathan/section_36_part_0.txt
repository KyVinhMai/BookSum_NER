On the other side of the ship, Klopp starts his engine. These aren't the only engines going: the German ground attack has been joined by an aerial assault force they see rising over the mountains. Yikes. If this isn't suspense, we don't know what is. The Leviathan is in the air, but something is dragging her down. What could it be? Everyone on board is dropping everything that can be spared over the side, but it's not helping. Let's ask Count Volger about this, shall we? Yeah, he totally snuck those gold bars aboard. Mo' money, mo' problems. Hoffman gives Volger away, and Alek darts off to find Volger and what's left of his fortune.", "analysis": ""}
