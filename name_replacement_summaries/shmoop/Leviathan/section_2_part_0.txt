This chapter opens in England, where Deryn Sharp has fallen asleep on her aeronautics manual. Falling asleep on textbooks: we can relate. Her elder brother, Jaspert, wakes her up, and they bicker about the airman middy's test she'll be taking that day. Deryn tries on the clothes she'll be wearing for the test--and if all goes well, for a long time afterward. They're boy's clothes because Deryn is planning to pass as Dylan and get into the British Air Service. Hey, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. Deryn and Jaspert take an omnibus drawn by a hippoesque to the Wormwood Scrubs airship field. Deryn reflects on how unfair it is that she was born a girl and has to lie to fly, when she's so much better at it than so many boys. Ugh--for real. The new recruits line up on the ascension field, where officers try to intimidate them. Hey, some things never change, even in alternate universes. Jaspert gets her past Lieutenant Cook, who tells her to get in another line--he also notes that she's really skinny, but he doesn't seem to suspect anything.", "analysis": ""}
