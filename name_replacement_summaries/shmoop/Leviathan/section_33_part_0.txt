Alek and Dylan bicker about which is better: beasts or machines. When Dr. Barlow returns, she is furious about the whole landing-in-France plan because she wants to complete her mission to the Ottoman Empire. Alek tells Dr. Barlow and Dylan his plan of using the walker's engines on the Leviathan. Dr. Barlow sees a ray of hope. She also sees exactly who Alek is--but she confronts him in a nice way, agrees to keep his secret for now, and goes to tell the captain about the engines.", "analysis": ""}
