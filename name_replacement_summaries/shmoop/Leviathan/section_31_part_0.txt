The zeppelins start putting men down on the ground, and Dr. Barlow says their goal is to capture the ship. Alek puts Deryn on the machine guns to fire at the Germans on the ground--one group of Germans is heading for the Leviathan, and the other is getting ready to fire on the walker. In the battle, Alek manages to stomp on the anti-walker gun, and things seem to be going their way. Then there's a loud explosion and the walker tips over.", "analysis": ""}
