Volger decides to pretend he doesn't know English in order to try to pick up valuable information. Classic Volger. Alek tells Dylan that Volger would like to meet with the captain. He also realizes that Dylan's plan kept the two groups from shooting at each other and grudgingly acknowledges that it was pretty smart. Volger and Alek meet with Captain Hobbes, Dr. Barlow, two officers, and another scientist. Alek makes a big show of translating everything for Volger. He's probably trying too hard. The Darwinists try to figure out exactly who the Clankers are, but what the Clankers are is evasive. They manage to negotiate Alek's return for the food they need to repair the airship. Volger trades himself for Alek as a hostage. Dr. Barlow agrees to go with the Clankers as a hostage, and also so she can collect appropriate food for the Leviathan.", "analysis": ""}
