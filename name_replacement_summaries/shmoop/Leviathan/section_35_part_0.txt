Deryn watches Alek through her binoculars, knowing nothing is a bigger crush-kill than a girl disguised as a boy crushing on a prince who can't reveal his identity. Romance is driven from her mind by approaching German walkers: nothing kills the mood like approaching German walkers. They've got to get the ship in the air pronto. Deryn uses a drop line to swing down to the engine pods and let the engineers know what's up; Alek calculates and tells her the German machine will be on them in twenty minutes. There's more: The Germans are armed with phosphorus flares--and phosphorus plus hydrogen equals boom. Deryn swings off to alert the bridge.", "analysis": ""}
