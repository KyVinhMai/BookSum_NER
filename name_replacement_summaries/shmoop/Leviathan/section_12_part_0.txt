Again with the first-world problems. He also thinks it's kind of weird that no one's worried about the war, until Volger tells him that they probably can't read newspapers. Klopp leads them to a mechanik's shop, where they attempt to buy some supplies. The shopkeeper offers Alek a toy walker, which Alek, in a bit of a temper tantrum, thinks he's too old for. Alek makes the mistake of opening his mouth, and his posh accent gives away his farmer's disguise. Volger buys the shopkeeper's silence, while Klopp drags Alek outside. As they head out of town, the men surmise that the Guild of Mechaniks has been told to be on the watch for them. While Volger and Klopp search for another place to buy fuel, Alek tries to buy a paper to find out what's going on in the outside world. As he does, he realizes he has no idea how to handle money and can barely speak the everyday dialect of his subjects. Humbled much, Alek?", "analysis": ""}
