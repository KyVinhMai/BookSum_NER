Then Alek has to try to get the archducal flag off the antenna, which really begs the question: Why did they leave it up there in the first place? Doesn't seem too bright. Alek finishes closing the viewport, just as the walker is struck by shrapnel. As the dreadnaught continues its pursuit, Klopp and Volger argue about whether or not a smaller walker would have been a better choice. Maybe save it for later, guys? In the process, Volger and Klopp reveal that they're headed for Switzerland. Probs for the watches and chocolate--oh right, or the neutrality. Take your pick. Bauer and Hoffman are firing at the dreadnaught, which Alek says won't do any good because it's so big. Klopp helpfully reminds him that the dreadnaught will have smaller escorts. The attack leaves Alek in no doubt that his mother and father are dead; he feels empty for a moment, until another attack from the dreadnaught's guns distracts him. Bauer and Hoffman fire the walker's cannon at the dreadnaught, and Volger asks Alek if he knows how to use a Spandau machine gun. He doesn't, but he's going to give it a shot anyway.
