The men on the ground finally notice the storm front and start to bring her down. It's too late, of course, and she's five hundred feet in the air when the rain starts. The ground men really struggle to get her down, and she has to do some serious aerobatics to keep the Huxley from plummeting her to her death. Finally, she has to cut the Huxley free of its ground tethers to keep it from crashing into the ground, which means she's now free-ballooning over London with no control over the Huxley at all and no clear idea of how to get down. All in all, it's kind of like anyone's first day at a new job.", "analysis": ""}
