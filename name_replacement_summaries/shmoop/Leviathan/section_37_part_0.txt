He finds Volger already jettisoning the gold bars. They argue as they pitch the gold overboard, because of course they do. But then comes a warm and fuzzy moment as they come to a mutual realization that Volger has been protecting Alek at every turn, and Alek says his life must take a different path. Also, they totes keep one gold bar--you don't want to throw all your money away, after all.", "analysis": ""}
