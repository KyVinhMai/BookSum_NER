So that's a bit of a comedown. Alek tries to sneak up on Volger, who is listening to Morse code over the wireless. Nobody sneaks up on Volger, though. Volger tells Alek that the army is preparing for war--or so he thinks, due to increased traffic on the wireless. Alek hopes this means everyone has forgotten about him. Volger says not a chance: Alek is super duper important, and no one would forget about wanting him dead. Comforting guy, that Volger. And then Volger stops spilling information and goes back to being Count Mysterious. Because they're both a bit annoyed at each other, Volger suggests a fencing lesson--nothing says relaxation quite like pointing a sharp object at someone who is getting on your nerves, after all. During the fencing lesson, Volger and Alek discuss international politics, outlining the way the great powers of Europe will ally with each other in the coming war. They conclude by figuring out that the Darwinist powers will fight the Clanker powers. Alek feels that the war is in some way his fault because no one wanted his parents' marriage or his birth, and now his parents' deaths are leading to war. Volger tells Alek he may still have a chance to influence the war, though of course he's very enigmatic about how.", "analysis": ""}
