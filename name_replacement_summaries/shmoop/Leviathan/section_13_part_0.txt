They hear the ominous sound of something heavy moving over the ground again, and this time, it's hoofbeats. Volger tells Alek to run for the walker while he and Klopp hold off the enemy. Alek runs, trying to get to the walker in order to bring it back to make a stand against the bad guys. And then a lone horseman comes out of nowhere, ready to fire on Alek. The horseman calls out that he missed on purpose and tries to take Alek prisoner. Alek realizes these horsemen don't know who he and his companions are--they think they're going after common thieves. Alek counterattacks by grabbing the saber off the rider's horse, and in the struggle, the horse throws its rider, killing him instantly. Alek realizes he indirectly killed an Austrian soldier. Cue some guilt. With no time to lose, Alek mounts the horse and rides it to the walker, which Bauer and Hoffman have already started up. Alek is the only pilot available, so he takes the controls. Finally, he's running well... but then he does some careening around. He manages to right the walker, though, and the horsemen disperse at the sight of the machine. Klopp enters the control room, telling Alek that Volger is also aboard but has been shot in the shoulder; he compliments Alek on his walker-running skills. As Alek pilots the walker forward, he thinks about the dead horseman and pushes his bad feelings into a little box, which anyone could tell him probably isn't the best way to handle them.", "analysis": ""}
