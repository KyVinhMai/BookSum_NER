She's worried about Newkirk and Mr. Rigby, but she puts the thought out of her mind so she can go after Dr. Barlow. She finds Dr. Barlow in the cargo room, trying to salvage her secret cargo: large eggs. Most are broken from the crash. Dr. Barlow is very concerned with keeping the eggs warm, so Deryn gives her a thermometer Alek brought. Dr. Barlow immediately notices that the thermometer is marked in Celsius, indicating that it's Clanker equipment. Deryn tells her about the strange boy, and Dr. Barlow finds this very interesting, especially when she sees that the supplies are marked as Austrian military issue. When Deryn tells Dr. Barlow how bad the crash is, Dr. Barlow tells Deryn it may be fatal because the ecosystem won't be able to repair itself on a barren glacier. And now Dr. Barlow wants to meet Alek.", "analysis": ""}
