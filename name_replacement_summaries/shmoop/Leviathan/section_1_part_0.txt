Alek sees a Cyklop Stormwalker with two Spandau machine guns, which is bigger than any walker he's ever piloted. Klopp assures Alek that he will help pilot, and that Alek's father wants him ready to handle any walker in the House Guard--war is coming, after all. Volger gives Alek a hard time about being too scared, which goads Alek into the walker. Two other men are already in the walker, which carries a crew of five; Alek takes the controls as Klopp guides him through his paces. Oh, and they don't turn the lights on because they're pretending to be stealthy. Pretending. Right. This is starting to sound a bit suspicious. Now Alek finally catches on: This isn't a nighttime lesson; no one's pretending. This trip is for real. Alek's first instinct is that the men might be traitors who are kidnapping him. Alas, no. As Alek struggles with them, the men knock him out using chemicals on a rag. Old school but effective. The last thing Alek hears is Volger's voice telling him that his parents have been murdered in Sarajevo.", "analysis": ""}
