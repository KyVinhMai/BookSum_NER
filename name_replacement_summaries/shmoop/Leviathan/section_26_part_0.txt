Deryn reflects on how close of a call she had: if she'd been injured, the surgeons might have undressed her. Captain Hobbes blows his whistle for attention, and gives the crew the good news: things are getting repaired. Then he gives them the bad news: not enough things are getting repaired, and they may have to let the Leviathan die in order to save the people aboard. Deryn isn't okay with this though, and she tells Newkirk that Alek is going to help them. In a hurry to find out where Alek lives, she ascends while the captain is still talking. Up in the Huxley, Deryn scans the horizon, discovering the castle Alek came from. Then she spots the walker heading toward the Leviathan; she flashes a message down. She sees the Austrian crest and figures out that Alek isn't Swiss--and therefore, isn't neutral--so she jabbers a message to her message lizard and sends it down the rope. She realizes that only Alek will be able to stop the walker from attacking. The message lizard isn't moving fast enough. Deryn needs to go down herself, however tricky that may be.", "analysis": ""}
