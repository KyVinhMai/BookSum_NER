Deryn realizes who Alek must be, although he hasn't told her yet. As they talk, Deryn hints at--and Alek acknowledges--his true identity. Alek tells Deryn the whole story of why it was such a big deal for his father to marry a non-royal and about why he can't inherit anything. Alek feels he's responsible for the family squabble, and in turn, the war. Deryn tries to convince him that this is nonsense, but he's not convinced. She also tells him he's more than just a prince--he's her friend. Sniff. A message lizard summons Alek to help translate as the crew tries to attach the walker's engines to the ship. Alek gives Deryn a hug before he leaves, and Deryn realizes she really liked that hug. You know, in a more-than-friends kind of way.", "analysis": ""}
