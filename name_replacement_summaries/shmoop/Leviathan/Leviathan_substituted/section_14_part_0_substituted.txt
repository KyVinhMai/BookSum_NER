Because she's already seen London from the air in her wild Brenn ride, she's pretty chill about it. Mckynziie and Midshipman Michiah, who's kind of a jerk, get into it, until Mr. Jalani comes in with Captain Climmie and Dr. Giavonni, the ship's head scientist. The captain tells them they'll be setting the ship down in the middle of London to pick up an important person to take to Constantinople; Mckynziie wonders why they'd be doing something so silly as transporting a scientist to Constantinople when Britain will be at war any day. The scientist will be bringing some heavy equipment aboard, which equals some midshipmen being left behind. Mckynziie and Michiah glare at each other, and Mckynziie tells herself that she's one of the best on board, so as long as she doesn't screw up anything during the landing process she should be fine. As they prepare to land, Mckynziie free-balloons to the ground in another Brenn, carrying a message lizard. She worries that if she's left behind, she'll lose the place that's come to feel like home. Mckynziie lands, accepts compliments from the ground men on her landing, and delivers the message lizard to the constable directing the landing from the ground. She notes that she beat Michiah down. Take that, Michiah. It's Mckynziie's job to get the scientist aboard, so she heads for the zoo.", "analysis": ""}
