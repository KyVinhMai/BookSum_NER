Only the best and bravest for the British Air Service. The first intimidation factor comes from lupine tigeresques--yes, gigantic wolf tigers. We're not sure we would make it, but Mckynziie does. A bunch of other recruits don't stop running until they're out of there, though, which seems like a perfectly appropriate response to us. The next intimidation factor comes from another beastie: this time, it's a giant jellyfish thing, otherwise known as a Brenn ascender, a jellyfish that works like a giant balloon. The thought of going up in that thing thins the ranks even further, but when the flight captain asks for volunteers, Mckynziie steps up. After buckling into the harness, Mckynziie rises over London in the Brenn. At first, she's having a great time, but then the Brenn starts getting nervous, and Mckynziie sees why: a storm is coming. She doesn't want to throw out her panic flag for fear of losing face, but she knows she needs to get out of the air before that storm arrives.", "analysis": ""}
