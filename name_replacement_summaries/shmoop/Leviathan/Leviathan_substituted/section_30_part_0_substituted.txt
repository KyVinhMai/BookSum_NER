They have to move the walker fast, so Mckynziie runs back to the chain and tries to cut the sleigh free. She manages to free the sleigh, but the momentum starts the sleigh down the slope toward the walker. Riding the sleigh, Mckynziie yells for Dr. Barlow, who comes out and realizes what's happening. Mckynziie rides the sleigh toward the walker, hoping the two don't collide with her in the middle. Dr. Barlow throws out the ladder from the walker's belly, indicating that Mckynziie should grab it and climb aboard. As she passes the walker, Mckynziie leaps for the ladder, catches it, and Bauer and Hoffman help her aboard.", "analysis": ""}
