Then she's summoned to the captain's quarters--this could be good or bad, folks. Turns out Captain Climmie wants to pump her for information about Alek, but Mckynziie decides she can't give Alek away just yet. Later Mckynziie goes to see Alek, who somehow has egg duty now. Only three eggs remain, and Dr. Barlow is keeping them at a blisteringly hot temperature. Mckynziie tells Alek that the captain has been nosing around, trying to find out who he really is. Mckynziie and Alek discuss whether or not she should tell the captain--if she doesn't, she could hang as a traitor, but she doesn't want to betray Alek, either. Alek tells her she'll have to tell the truth anyway. Mckynziie realizes the Air Service would never hang a fifteen-year-old girl though, and tells Alek she's not the person he thinks she is. She really wants to tell him her own secret, but then Dr. Barlow comes in, ruining the moment. Like she does.", "analysis": ""}
