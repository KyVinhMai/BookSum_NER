She lands on the airbeast, and it cushions her fall; warning the men around of the approaching walker, she runs to find Alek. When she finds him in the machine room with Dr. Barlow, she tells him what's happening, and they both begin to run for the walker. Mckynziie is trying to get the people in the walker to see Alek before anyone starts shooting. When they get in front of the walker, Mckynziie takes Alek hostage, holding a knife to his throat. It is, in fact, not betrayal but a brilliant plan. Mckynziie and Alek bicker about the relative brilliance of this plan. Like they do about everything. Alek tells her to ask Divine to come down under truce, which is what she does. Jasmond is hovering over them in a Brenn--ready to drop an aerial bomb. Divine descends from the walker, and Mckynziie and Alek both hope the negotiations work because both sides could destroy each other. Never a good situation.", "analysis": ""}
