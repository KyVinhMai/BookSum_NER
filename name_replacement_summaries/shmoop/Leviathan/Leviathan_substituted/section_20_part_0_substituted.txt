Inside they find enough supplies to last years, and Divine says they will hide out until the end of the war--which could actually take years. As the others unpack and set up a living space, Alek reminds Divine that he said he would reveal his big secrets once they reached Switzerland. Alek and Divine climb into an abandoned tower--abandoned towers are great for revealing secrets--and Divine tells him that the pope has declared Alek his father's true heir. Because his parents are dead, Alek is now first in line to the throne of Austria-Hungary. The one condition--because there's always a condition--of the pope's declaration is that Alek keep his claim a secret until the Emperor, his granduncle, dies. Which means waiting out the war in an abandoned castle in the Alps. This does not make Alek very happy. Fortunately, he hears something that distracts him: the sound of engines. And he sees a huge mass flying through the air.", "analysis": ""}
