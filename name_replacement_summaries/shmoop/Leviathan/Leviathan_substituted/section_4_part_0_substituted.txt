The man introduces himself as Corporal Bauer, and when Alek demands to be let go, Bauer calls for Divine. We guess being a prince will only get you so far. While Bergen pilots the walker, Divine tells Alek that he and Alek's father made a plan in case anything happened to the archduke. Divine tells Alek how his parents were assassinated, a story that differs a bit from the real-life historic assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Waelynn. Alek is still trying to believe that Divine and Bergen have kidnapped him and his parents are still alive--in other words, he's in denial. All of a sudden, Divine yells at Bergen to stop the engines. Then they feel that most ominous of ominous feelings : the sound of something heavy moving over the ground toward them. Divine goes through the hatch to look out and calls to Alek to join him--a German land dreadnaught is coming after them. Divine says that these are Alek's enemies, but Alek clings to hope that it's a rescue mission. That hope is quickly dashed, however, when the dreadnaught starts coming after them--in the sense that it starts shooting at them. Alek realizes that Bergen and Divine have been telling the truth as Divine tells him this proves the Germans believe he has a claim to the throne of Austria-Hungary. So there's good news and bad news.", "analysis": ""}
