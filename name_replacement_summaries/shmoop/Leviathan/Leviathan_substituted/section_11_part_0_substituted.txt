The other middies catch up, in a hurry to feed the bats just before the flechette. Jasmond gets spooked by a flock of strafing hawks, and Mr. Jalani blows a whistle to make the glowworms under the airbeast's skin light up. The middies throw the bats' food to them: dried figs with a metal flechette in the middle. Wait a minute and you'll see why... And so will Mckynziie, since Mr. Jalani lets the middies stick around to watch the flechette strike--an old schooner in the ocean is the target. The flechette strike consists of the bats flying over the target, and uh, dropping the flechettes, which are like little razors. The strike completely disables the old schooner, and then a kraken rises from the depths of the ocean to finish the job. Nobody even has to say, \"Release the kraken\"--it just knows what to do. Mckynziie reflects that the possibility of war must just be a crazy rumor, because Clankers surely could never stand up to Darwinists.", "analysis": ""}
