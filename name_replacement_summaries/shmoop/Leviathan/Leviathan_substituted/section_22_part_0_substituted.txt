{"name": "Chapter 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-23", "summary": "This is the first chapter in which Mckynziie and Alek are both present, but the narrator continues to view the world through Mckynziie's eyes for two chapters and then through Alek's eyes for two chapters. Note that Alek doesn't know Mckynziie is a girl, so in Alek's chapters, Mckynziie becomes Dylan. That's one way to tell who's narrating. Alek introduces himself simply as Alek, and Mckynziie thinks he's really weird. Mckynziie wants to find out what she can do to help with the wreck, but she isn't feeling well--being nearly buried under a flying whale will do that to you. So instead she asks Alek what his village can do to help them, and Alek starts nervously backtracking re: personal information. Mckynziie finds this extremely suspicious and blows an intruder alert on her whistle, Captain von Trapp style. Alek runs for it, and then he pulls a gun, which apparently he doesn't know is a bad idea around a big bag of hydrogen. Mckynziie tackles him, feeling it's better to take a bullet than be set on fire. Mr. Roland, the master rigger, arrives, and Mckynziie turns Alek over to him--in turn, Mr. Roland sends Mckynziie to find Dr. Barlow and see what she says about all the supplies Alek brought.", "analysis": ""}
