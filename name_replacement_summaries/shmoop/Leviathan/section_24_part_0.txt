In walk Dylan, Dr. Barlow, and Tazza--Tazza freaks Alek out, and of course, so does Dr. Barlow. Dr. Barlow asks a series of uncomfortable questions about Alek's family, and then suggests they show Alek the Huxleys so he'll understand how easily they can find whatever he's hiding. They lead Alek through the insides of the airbeast to the Huxleys, which he finds both freaky and fascinating. Once Alek agrees to lead them to his home under truce, Dr. Barlow addresses him in Latin. Having learned nothing from that little incident in Lienz, he answers--and he's pretty sure she knows who he is.", "analysis": ""}
