The speaker of the passage tells people not to look down on those who act or pretend for a living. After all, everybody lies - from beggars to clergymen. Philip Malvoisin's brother Albert is a member of the Order of the Knights Templar and the President of the Templar society at Templestowe. Lucas Beaumanoir accuses Albert of helping Bois-Guilbert hide Rebecca at Templestowe. Albert realizes that both he and Bois-Guilbert are going to be ruined unless he thinks of something fast. When Beaumanoir describes Rebecca as \"a Jewish sorceress\" , Albert plays along. Albert was wondering how a good knight like Bois-Guilbert could suddenly fall so hard for a woman he didn't know. But of course, it's because Rebecca is a witch! Albert also explains that he only brought Rebecca here because the holiness of this place would stop them from breaking Bois-Guilbert's vow of chastity. Albert reminds him that they don't want to lose Bois-Guilbert, since he's been so strong in the Crusades. Beaumanoir's anti-Semitism and hatred of women makes him eager to pick Rebecca as the sole target of his anger. He resolves to judge and condemn her for witchcraft. Albert slips away to talk to Bois-Guilbert. Bois-Guilbert is furious because Rebecca absolutely refuses to have sex with him. Albert is mad because Bois-Guilbert could have tons of women less difficult than Rebecca. Albert tells Bois-Guilbert that Beaumanoir knows Rebecca is at Templestowe. Albert says there's no way for Bois-Guilbert to rescue her. Bois-Guilbert doesn't want to let Rebecca die. But he also doesn't want to give up his position and honor as a Knight Templar. The trial is set to begin immediately - Beaumanoir doesn't want to waste any time in condemning Rebecca. Beaumanoir's friend Conrade tells Albert to find more damaging proof of Rebecca's guilt - even if he has to make it up. If Albert helps Beaumanoir convict Rebecca, he'll get a better posting in the south of England. Albert goes to bribe Philip Malvoisin and his followers to testify against Rebecca. When the guards arrive at Rebecca's room, she's happy to see them. She thinks that if she can just explain everything to a judge she will be free of Bois-Guilbert. As she walks into the main hall, someone stuffs a paper into her hand. She doesn't read the message right away. She is just happy to know that she has a friend in the room.", "analysis": ""}
