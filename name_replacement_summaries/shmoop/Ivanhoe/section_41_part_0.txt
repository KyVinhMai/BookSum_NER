The speaker sings of the merry life of people living freely in the forests. Ivanhoe and Gurth come across the outlaws, King Richard , Robin Hood , and Wamba. Ivanhoe is amazed to see these men with six or seven dead bodies lying around them. King Richard says that everything is fine. All the men around him, including the outlaws, are true Englishmen. He scolds Ivanhoe for being out of bed so soon. Ivanhoe says he is perfectly fine. How could King Richard have left him behind, to travel unguarded through the forest? King Richard is glad to have adventures, even if they are dangerous. Ivanhoe points out that King Richard has a responsibility to his kingdom to stay safe. King Richard reminds Ivanhoe that he has been staying in disguise to stall for extra time. His allies need time to assemble their troops before Richard appears, so that Prince John's rebellion won't catch them unprepared. King Richard asks Robin Hood if they have any food to share. They do, but it's all deer meat that Robin Hood and his outlaws have stolen from the royal parks. King Richard says he doesn't care about poaching, and they settle in for a feast. Everyone is having a good time, but Robin Hood pulls Ivanhoe aside. Robin Hood says there are a lot of pressing matters for King Richard to deal with. Should he be wasting time feasting in the forest? Robin Hood decides they need to hurry King Richard along. He sends one of his men in secret into the forest. Robin Hood orders the man to play a Norman horn blast. The outlaws think the Normans are gathering together and all leap to their feet. Once King Richard has pulled on all of his armor and prepared to set off, Robin Hood kneels in front of him. Robin Hood apologizes for the deception, but he <em>really </em>wants King Richard to stop delaying. King Richard admits that Ivanhoe is also uneasy. King Richard, Ivanhoe, Gurth, and Wamba all set off to Coningsburgh, the castle of the late Athelstane. They arrive at the castle just as Athelstane's men are mourning his death. The steward of the household escorts them inside.", "analysis": ""}
