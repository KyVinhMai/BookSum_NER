The evil character Glenalvon plans to kidnap a married woman, Lady Randolph. In other words, it's a line about forcing a woman into a sexual relationship. In another part of the castle, Rebecca has been locked in a tower. There is an old woman in her cell, Urfried, who doesn't want to leave. Urfried hates Rebecca for her youth and beauty. She mocks Rebecca, telling her that the Normans won't kill her. She strongly implies that they'll rape her instead. Urfried leaves Rebecca to her fate. Rebecca looks around the room and sees no hope of escaping. She decides to stay as strong as she can, no matter what happens. A man appears at the door of her cell. He's dressed like one of the outlaws of the forest, with a cap half hiding his face. Rebecca offers him the ornaments she is wearing to ransom herself and her father. The outlaw refuses. He is not interested in money. The outlaw is none other than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. He wants Rebecca. Rebecca doesn't understand how a man sworn to fight on behalf of the cross can treat her this way. But Bois-Guilbert doesn't feel bad about breaking his vow of chastity. He has gone to the Holy Land to fight for the Temple of Solomon. After that, a small sin like sex is not going to damage his righteousness, he thinks. Rebecca swears to cross all of Europe and tell everyone that Bois-Guilbert raped her and broke his vows if he goes through with this. Bois-Guilbert worries about this potential loss of reputation. He demands that Rebecca convert to Christianity. Then he will keep her as a Norman lady. Rebecca defies Bois-Guilbert: how can she convert to Christianity when <em>he </em>is her example of what it means to be Christian? Rebecca runs to the window and stands ready to throw herself out. Bois-Guilbert feels bad and promises not to harm her. He is moved by her beauty and pride, and apologizes. Bois-Guilbert explains that heartbreak has made him this cruel. When he returned from the Crusades, having won fame and glory, he found that his ladylove had married an ordinary squire. Ever since, he has sworn to follow the solitary life of a Knight Templar. Bois-Guilbert hears the horn blowing at the gate. He asks Rebecca to think about what he has said.", "analysis": ""}
