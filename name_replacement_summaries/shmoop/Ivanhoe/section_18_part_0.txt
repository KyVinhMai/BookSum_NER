The poem describes the Ettrick Forest in Scotland. When Cedric sees Ivanhoe fall down at the end of the tournament, he almost picks him up to take care of him. But Cedric is too proud to acknowledge the son he disinherited so long ago in front of so many people. Once the crowds clear a bit, Ivanhoe has already disappeared, and Cedric has no idea where he's gone. Oswald, Cedric's attendant, recognizes Ivanhoe's servant as none other than Gurth, the pig-herder. Cedric continues to be angry. Rowena tries to soothe him, but Cedric goes on thinking that Ivanhoe is disobedient and ungrateful. Rowena also refuses to go to Prince John's banquet with Cedric and Athelstane. The banquet leaves Cedric in a really bad mood. When Cedric returns from the banquet, he spots Gurth. He immediately orders his men to put Gurth in chains to punish him for running away. Cedric, Rowena, and Athelstane set out for a late supper with Abbot Waltheoff at the convent of Saint Withold. As they leave the convent after having eaten, they see a bad omen: a large black dog. Cedric recognizes the dog as Gurth's and throws a spear at it. The dog is injured and runs away. Gurth swears he will never have anything to do with Cedric again. At the front of the group, Cedric and Athelstane talk about the future. Cedric has decided that it will be necessary for Athelstane and Rowena to marry to restart the kingdom of the Saxons. But Cedric also knows that Rowena is totally in love with Ivanhoe. Cedric encourages Athelstane to woo Rowena, but Athelstane is too lazy. Cedric hopes to influence Rowena, but she won't listen. Cedric's temper is not improving with this trip into the forest.", "analysis": ""}
