{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-22", "summary": "This chapter starts with a famous quote from Act II of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice . In this passage Shylock, the Jew, cries out because his daughter Jessica has eloped with a Christian and stolen his money. These lines are from a Jewish character who has lost both his daughter and his cash - which implies that Isaac and Rebecca are going to feature in this chapter. We switch focus to Isaac of York, who has been stuck in the castle dungeons. Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Bois-Guilbert's two Muslim servants enter Isaac's cell. Front-de-Boeuf demands a thousand pounds of silver from Isaac. Isaac has no hope of coming up with that much money; all the Jews of the city of York put together don't have that much. Front-de-Boeuf is willing to accept gold instead of silver if necessary. Front-de-Boeuf threatens Isaac with horrible torture if he doesn't pay up. He promises that he's capable of torture, which he's done plenty of during the Crusades in the Holy Land. Under the threat of torture, Isaac agrees to pay the thousand pounds of silver. Front-de-Boeuf won't let Isaac go free until the silver is paid. Isaac asks if he can ransom his fellow prisoners with that same thousand pounds. Front-de-Boeuf tells Isaac not to worry about the Saxons; they are here for different reasons. Isaac asks if his daughter, Rebecca, can go to York to gather the treasure. Front-de-Boeuf sneers that he's already sent Rebecca to Bois-Guilbert. Isaac is heartbroken. He refuses to pay a penny to Front-de-Boeuf, no matter what tortures he has to suffer. Isaac won't help the man who took his daughter away. Front-de-Boeuf starts preparing to torture Isaac, but he is interrupted by the horn blasts from the castle gate.", "analysis": ""}
