The Friar wants to hear a song from the Black Knight. He wants a real English song - none of this new French stuff. The Black Knight launches into a song called \"The Crusader's Return,\" about a knight fighting in the Crusades and dreaming of his ladylove. All of the knight's victories in the song are thanks to his love. The Friar applauds, though he thinks the song is a bit gloomy. Then the Friar sings his own song: \"The Barefooted Friar.\" It is a funny song about what a good, lazy life a churchman can have. The Black Knight applauds happily, but then he teases the Friar about the unholy life he leads. The Friar shouts that he's not afraid of the devil in any case. He names a whole bunch of saints to protect him, all English saints from the days before the Norman invasion of Britain. The Friar and the Black Knight continue to make merry until a loud knocking at the door interrupts them.", "analysis": ""}
