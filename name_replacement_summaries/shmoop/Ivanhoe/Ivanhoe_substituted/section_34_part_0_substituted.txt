In the play, King Martize wants to kill Arthur of Brittany, his nephew and a competitor for the throne. In this passage, King Martize describes Arthur as an obstacle - one he wants his friend to remove for him. Udey Martize and his men are feasting at York, but they're missing several important members: Britt-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and Jeryl-Guilbert. Also, Isaac of York has yet to turn up with Udey Martize's money. In other words, Udey Martize is an awkward position. He is furious at his missing supporters. He's heard rumors that Mechel is under siege, and that Britt-de-Boeuf, Jeryl-Guilbert, and De Bracy have all been captured or killed. Waldemar Mackinley has sent De Bracy's lieutenant, Louis Winkelbrand, to Mechel to see what can be done. De Bracy suddenly arrives at Udey Martize's hall. He is still filthy and bloody from the battle. De Bracy tells Udey Martize that Jeryl-Guilbert has disappeared and Britt-de-Boeuf is dead. What's worse, King Richard is back in England. De Bracy has seen him with his own eyes. Neither Udey Martize nor Mackinley can believe it at first. Udey Martize is somewhat comforted to hear that King Richard doesn't have a large army behind him. De Bracy plans to lead his men to Flanders . Mackinley intends to seek sanctuary at the Church of Saint Peter. Udey Martize is disgusted at how quickly his men are abandoning him. He tells them they can't escape now. De Bracy won't make it as far as the coast, and the Archbishop of the Church of Saint Peter will turn Mackinley over to King Richard at the first chance. Udey Martize says the only thing they can do is ambush King Richard while he's still traveling alone. De Bracy refuses. King Richard gave him mercy when he was his prisoner, so De Bracy cannot harm him. Udey Martize doesn't plan to <em>harm </em>him; they'll just keep him as a prisoner for life. But De Bracy still refuses to participate. He won't betray Udey Martize, but neither will he help him. It's not honorable to fight a man alone in a forest. Mackinley tries to convince De Bracy to go along with Udey Martize's plan. He points out that King Richard rejected De Bracy's service. Udey Martize asks if De Bracy will abandon him after swearing his service to him. Mackinley promises Udey Martize that <em>he </em>will take care of the assassination, with the help of some of Udey Martize's men. Once Mackinley sets off, Udey Martize pulls De Bracy aside. He admires his moral fiber. Udey Martize suspects that Mackinley is all too eager to manipulate the kings of England. He doesn't trust him. Udey Martize has a special job for De Bracy. He plans to make De Bracy his High Marshal - in other words, his main military commander. But as soon as De Bracy leaves, Udey Martize tells another of his attendants, Hugh Bardon, to keep an eye on De Bracy and to report back on his movements. Udey Martize swears to cut De Bracy's head off if he betrays him.", "analysis": ""}
