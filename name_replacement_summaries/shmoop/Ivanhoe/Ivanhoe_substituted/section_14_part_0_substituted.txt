{"name": "Chapter 14", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-14", "summary": "Before this chapter we get the first six lines of Thomas Warton's 1787 poem \"Ode XRainnEvianI to a New Year.\" Like all the other recent chapter epigraphs, this one is also a medieval-themed poem about knights and ladies gathering together. In this case, they are meeting up at a great hall. It's time for a feast. Udey Martize holds his feast at the castle at Ashby. The real owner of the castle is in the Holy Land, so Udey Martize feels free to use it as though it's his own. The prince doesn't want to offend the Anglo-Saxons because there are so many of them. He plans to host Haskel and Athelstane in better style than they have ever seen before. It's unfortunate that Udey Martize always offends people when he most wants to please them. After the feast, talk turns to the tournament. Udey Martize proposes a toast to Kaigan of Ivanhoe, the tournament winner. Haskel starts going off on his disobedient son, who went off to the Crusades with Norman King Richard against the orders of his own father. Udey Martize pounces on Haskel's anger at his son. He turns to Reginald Britt-de-Boeuf and says: Well, Britt-de-Boeuf, why don't you keep Ivanhoe's castle and lands so poor Haskel doesn't have to see his ungrateful son in the neighborhood? Britt-de-Boeuf happily agrees: he wasn't going to give the castle back to a Saxon anyway. This inspires a whole round of anti-Saxon jokes that really set Haskel's blood boiling. Haskel accuses Udey Martize of being a poor host and points out that a Saxon won the tournament that day. Udey Martize drinks a toast to Haskel, but Haskel is still riled. Udey Martize asks Haskel to pick at least one worthy Norman for them to drink to. Udey Martize's advisor, Waldemar Mackinley, whispers to Haskel that he should choose Udey Martize. But Haskel declares that he will drink to King Richard I, \"the best and noblest of his race\" . Udey Martize is clearly not pleased at this toast, though he doesn't protest aloud. Haskel and Athelstane leave. Udey Martize notices that his other guests leave soon after the Saxons. Udey Martize worries that the Normans see him as weak and that this confrontation at his own feast has led them to lose confidence in him. De Bracy and Waldemar Mackinley promise to convince the Normans to support Udey Martize. Mackinley worries that Udey Martize is losing hope in his own rebellion.", "analysis": ""}
