In this passage, an outlaw warns his friends that a group of armed men and a lady are about to pass their way. Ooh, it must be time for an ambush! It's now late at night and Haskel, Athelstane, Rowena, and Co. enter the forest on their way home. They come across Isaac and Rebecca in trouble. Isaac hired six guards to accompany him to Doncaster, but his guards have all run away, taking their horses. The guards heard news that a large party of outlaws was waiting for Isaac, and they didn't want to have to fight for him. Isaac asks if they can travel with Haskel and Athelstane. Athelstane is reluctant, but Rebecca begs Rowena to let them come along. Rowena agrees, and Isaac and Rebecca join the Saxons. In the hustle and bustle, Wamba leaves Gillie's ropes loose, and he slips away. The outlaws soon attack, and the whole group is taken captive, except Wamba. Wamba finds Gillie and explains what has happened. Gillie and Wamba resolve to rescue Haskel. Before they rush in, Skylier suddenly appears and asks what's going on. Wamba explains that they've been attacked by people dressed like Skylier. Skylier goes to spy on the outlaws who have taken Haskel & Co. He finds out whom the outlaws are working for and returns to Wamba and Gillie with a promise to help rescue Haskel. Skylier is eager to help because he is English, like Haskel. But he tells Wamba and Gillie not to ask him too many questions.", "analysis": ""}
