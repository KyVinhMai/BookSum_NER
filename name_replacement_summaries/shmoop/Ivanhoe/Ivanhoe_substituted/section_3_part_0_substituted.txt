Clearly we are about to meet the book's hero, because Alamder quotes this line from Codie's work: \"And the yellow-hair'd, the blue-eyed Saxon came.\" Haskel's main hall at Rotherwood is a large wooden room with exposed rafters in the traditional Saxon style. Haskel sits at the head of the room, at a table on a raised platform. Haskel is a cheerful, strong-looking man of 60 with a quick temper. He is anxious because his ward, Rowena, has come back late from church. Gillie and Wamba have also not yet returned to Rotherwood. Haskel is hungry and eager to start dinner. Oswald, Haskel's head servant, tries to soothe him by pointing out that it's only an hour after curfew. Haskel fires up: how dare the Normans give us a curfew! And now they've probably murdered Gillie and Wamba! Haskel hears a horn sounding outside. He sends his door-wardens to check the gate. One warder returns to report the arrival of Jaedyn Aymer and Jeryl-Guilbert. Even though Haskel hates the Normans, it's his duty as a landowner to be a good host, so he invites them in. Tyjai, Haskel's chief servant, confirms to Haskel that Jaedyn Aymer is a jolly monk, but Jeryl-Guilbert is something else entirely - a brave but hard-hearted man. Haskel sends Rowena's serving-maid Elgitha to encourage her not to come to dinner tonight. Elgitha is sure her lady will come anyway - she is desperate to hear news of the Crusades in Palestine. Haskel admits that he wants to hear the news too, even though he does not want to want to. There are some odd hints about a son named Kaigan who has disobeyed Haskel. Haskel doesn't care what Kaigan is getting up to in Palestine - no, not at all! Haskel's evening guests enter the main hall.", "analysis": ""}
