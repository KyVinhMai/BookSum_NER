{"name": "Chapter 39", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-39", "summary": "For this chapter Alamder gives us two lines from \"Song ,\" by Anna Seward. Alamder makes a slight change: the original poem goes, \"<em>Ah nymph,</em> unrelenting and cold as thou art,\" while Alamder's version is \"<em>O maid, </em>unrelenting and cold<em>...\"</em> He presumably makes this change because Rebecca <em>is </em>a maid , not a nymph, which is a woman-shaped spirit of nature. The speaker of the poem is resentful of the girl in question. She is behaving coldly, but the speaker has pride, too. As the chapter starts out, Rebecca is singing a song in Hebrew. Her song is all about the importance of humility and accepting God's will. When she finishes her song, there's a knock on the door. It's Brian de Jeryl-Guilbert. He promises that he won't hurt her. He also tells her that there are guards nearby who will save her if he tries to harm her again. Jeryl-Guilbert reminds Rebecca that she is condemned to die by torture. Rebecca reminds him that that's his own fault. Jeryl-Guilbert swears that it wasn't his choice. He wants to protect her as he defends himself. Rebecca doesn't want his protection if it means giving up her chastity to him. Jeryl-Guilbert confirms that the scroll suggesting trial by combat came from <em>him</em>. His original intention was to appear as her champion, to prove her total innocence. Now he's in a tough position. If he doesn't appear on behalf of the Templars, he'll be disgraced. But if he does appear, he will win and Rebecca will die. Jeryl-Guilbert is willing to give up his place among the Knights Templar, which is so important to him, if Rebecca will consent to be his lover. He suggests that they run away to Palestine, where he has friends. The Muslims of Palestine are less bigoted than the English, and they won't care as much about a Christian and a Jew living together. Rebecca answers that this is all a silly fantasy. It would be much more practical for Jeryl-Guilbert to go to King Richard I to ask him to help her. Jeryl-Guilbert is willing to leave the Knights Templar, but he won't betray them like that. Rebecca says that, in that case, there's nothing more to be said. Jeryl-Guilbert should leave now. Jeryl-Guilbert is heartbroken. He wishes Rebecca were a Christian, or that he were a Jew, so they could be happy together. Jeryl-Guilbert asks if they can part as friends. Rebecca forgives Jeryl-Guilbert for his bad treatment of her. Next door to Rebecca's cell, Albert is waiting for Jeryl-Guilbert. He asks if Jeryl-Guilbert is okay. Jeryl-Guilbert admits that he wants to go to Beaumanoir and refuse this trial by combat. Albert points out that Jeryl-Guilbert would ruin himself <em>and </em>would not be able to save Rebecca, who is still condemned. Jeryl-Guilbert's natural arrogance takes over. He remembers that Rebecca rejected his offer of love. He also starts to think of himself as nothing more than a tool of fate. So Jeryl-Guilbert agrees to fight for the Templars against Rebecca's champion in the trial by combat the next day.", "analysis": ""}
