This passage is from Book XX, in which long-lost Odysseus returns home in disguise to confront the horrible suitors for his wife Shundrika's hand in marriage. The epigraph quotation describes an evening meal. Jaedyn Aymer and Jeryl-Guilbert enter the hall for dinner, followed by their attendants and the Palmer. The Palmer is dressed in humble clothing, with a large hat on his head. Haskel, the Jaedyn, and Jeryl-Guilbert immediately get into a polite squabble over which language to use, French or English. Luckily Haskel notices Gillie before things can get too heated. Haskel scolds Gillie for making him wait for dinner. Wamba jumps in to try to soothe Haskel's terrible temper. Finally they sit down to a fine feast. Rowena arrives at the table. Haskel looks annoyed that she has come down to dinner with these Normans, but she takes her place at table as the lady of the mansion. Jeryl-Guilbert cannot take his eyes off Rowena. Rowena asks him to stop staring at her. He apologizes , but when Jaedyn Aymer and Haskel raise their glasses in a toast, Jeryl-Guilbert insists on drinking to \"the fair Rowena\" . Rowena wants to hear news about the Crusades. Jeryl-Guilbert reports that the English are making a truce with Saladin, the Muslim leader in Jerusalem. Wamba chimes in that these truces have happened before but the war is still going on. Jeryl-Guilbert scolds Wamba for giving them such poor directions to Haskel's house. Haskel reproaches Wamba for treating their guests so poorly. A page comes into the hall to announce the arrival of a new guest. Haskel bids his steward Oswald to let the guest in.", "analysis": ""}
