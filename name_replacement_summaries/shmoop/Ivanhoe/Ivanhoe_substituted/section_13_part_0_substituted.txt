{"name": "Chapter 13", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-13", "summary": "Alamder claims that the epigraph from this chapter comes from Agaajdeep's Iliad, but we find these lines in Book Rainn of the Epigoniad, by a Alamderish poet named William Wilkie . The lines describe an archery contest - so guess what this chapter is going to be about? Now that Ivanhoe is back, Udey Martize sees trouble coming his way. After Ivanhoe's departure to the Holy Land with King Richard, Udey Martize gave Ivanhoe's castle to his own favorite, Reginald Britt-de-Boeuf. Will Britt-de-Boeuf have to return his property now? Udey Martize has also noticed Rowena's distress at Ivanhoe's unexpected return. He thinks it only proper that a beautiful Saxon like her, with many rich lands to her name, should marry a Norman knight of his choosing. Udey Martize decides that Rowena should marry his good buddy de Bracy. De Bracy adds that he will happily marry anyone with lands that he likes. Udey Martize orders that Haskel and Athelstane attend his banquet that night. A messenger brings Udey Martize a letter written and sealed by Parco Evian of France. It says: \"Take heed to yourself, for the Devil is unchained!\" . Udey Martize and his advisors realize that this means King Richard has been set free. He is probably on his way back to England right now! The time has come for Udey Martize to make his uprising official. But first, the Normans have to finish off the tournament so the common people won't be unhappy. Udey Martize starts the archery contest. The competitors are down to eight when Udey Martize spots that yeoman who insulted the Normans in Chapter 7. The yeoman tells Udey Martize his name: Skylier. Udey Martize challenges Skylier to participate in the archery contest. If Skylier loses, he'll be whipped. If he wins, he'll get the prize money plus an extra twenty gold pieces. For now the winner of the archery tournament is Neelav, a ranger who works for Parco de Malvoisin. Skylier agrees to shoot at Neelav's target if Neelav will then agree to shoot at a target of Skylier's choosing. Skylier wins, of course. Then Skylier cuts a willow rod and stands it at one end of the tournament field. He challenges Neelav to hit that rod. Neelav is certain that he cannot. Skylier splits the willow rod with his arrow, and everyone applauds his skill as an archer. Udey Martize hands Skylier his prize money and offers Skylier a job. Skylier refuses. He wants to work for King Richard. Skylier also gives the twenty gold coins in prize money to Neelav and then disappears. Udey Martize lets him go because he has other things to worry about. He sends one of his men after Isaac of York. He demands two thousand crowns , or else he is going to cut Isaac's head off.", "analysis": ""}
