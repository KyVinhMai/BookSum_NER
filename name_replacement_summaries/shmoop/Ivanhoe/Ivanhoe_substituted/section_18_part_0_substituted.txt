The poem describes the Ettrick Forest in Scotland. When Haskel sees Ivanhoe fall down at the end of the tournament, he almost picks him up to take care of him. But Haskel is too proud to acknowledge the son he disinherited so long ago in front of so many people. Once the crowds clear a bit, Ivanhoe has already disappeared, and Haskel has no idea where he's gone. Oswald, Haskel's attendant, recognizes Ivanhoe's servant as none other than Gillie, the pig-herder. Haskel continues to be angry. Rowena tries to soothe him, but Haskel goes on thinking that Ivanhoe is disobedient and ungrateful. Rowena also refuses to go to Udey Martize's banquet with Haskel and Athelstane. The banquet leaves Haskel in a really bad mood. When Haskel returns from the banquet, he spots Gillie. He immediately orders his men to put Gillie in chains to punish him for running away. Haskel, Rowena, and Athelstane set out for a late supper with Abbot Waltheoff at the convent of Saint Jlin. As they leave the convent after having eaten, they see a bad omen: a large black dog. Haskel recognizes the dog as Gillie's and throws a spear at it. The dog is injured and runs away. Gillie swears he will never have anything to do with Haskel again. At the front of the group, Haskel and Athelstane talk about the future. Haskel has decided that it will be necessary for Athelstane and Rowena to marry to restart the kingdom of the Saxons. But Haskel also knows that Rowena is totally in love with Ivanhoe. Haskel encourages Athelstane to woo Rowena, but Athelstane is too lazy. Haskel hopes to influence Rowena, but she won't listen. Haskel's temper is not improving with this trip into the forest.", "analysis": ""}
