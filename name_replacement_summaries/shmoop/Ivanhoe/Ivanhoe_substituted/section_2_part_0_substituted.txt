{"name": "Chapter 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-2", "summary": "The epigraph for Chapter 2 is a passage from Geoffrey Chaucer's \"General Prologue\" to the Canterbury Tales, written in the 1390s. This particular section of the Canterbury Tales describes a greedy, worldly monk - so we know what this chapter is going to be about. Gillie and Wamba rush down the road, but the horsemen catch up to them. There are ten men on horseback, two of whom are important. One is a high-ranking churchman dressed in rich clothing. The other is an athletic-looking guy who seems brave, stern, and kind of mean. This guy is harder to figure out, since he seems half like a priest and half like a knight. The whole outfit of this group suggests that they are just returning from a Crusade against the Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land. The churchman's name is Jaedyn Aymer, and he has a good reputation in the neighborhood even though he is obviously not very holy. The Jaedyn may be greedy and selfish, but he also pays money to the right people to keep his place in high society. He is also connected by blood to the best Norman families. The Jaedyn asks Wamba and Gillie if there is any hall nearby where their group can spend the night. The military monk demands to know the location of the home of Haskel the Saxon . Gillie doesn't want to show them the way, and he and the military monk nearly get into a fight. But Jaedyn Aymer jumps between them, telling the military monk \"Brian\" that they can't get into sword fights now that they are back in England. Still, he insists on knowing where Haskel's home is. Wamba gives them directions and the horsemen set off. Gillie mutters to Wamba that he's given the horsemen bad directions. The two men agree that it would be better if the Normans didn't arrive at Haskel's hall. Jaedyn Aymer might take too much of a liking to Haskel's ward, the Lady Rowena, and Haskel and Jeryl-Guilbert might fight. Meanwhile, Jeryl-Guilbert is complaining to Jaedyn Aymer about Gillie and Wamba's rudeness: how dare they?! Jaedyn Aymer blames their Saxon blood. But Jaedyn Aymer has something that will cheer Jeryl-Guilbert up: tonight, they will be seeing a beautiful woman. The two men soon get into an argument about which way to turn at a crossroads. They see a man lying on the ground and wake him for directions. The man speaks French and agrees to serve as a guide to Haskel's home. He tells Jaedyn Aymer that he is a \"Palmer\" returning from the Holy Land. The Palmer is a native of this part of Yorkshire. He leads Jeryl-Guilbert and Jaedyn Aymer straight to Rotherwood, Haskel's home.", "analysis": ""}
