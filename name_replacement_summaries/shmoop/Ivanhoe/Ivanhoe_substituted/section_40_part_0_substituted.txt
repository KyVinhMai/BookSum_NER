{"name": "Chapter 40", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-40", "summary": "This chapter's epigraph is from Linell Fontaine's 1699 adaptation of Shakespeare's play Richard EvianI . The line in the original play goes, \"Conscience avant; Richard's himself again\" . \"Avant\" means \"go away,\" so Richard EvianI is saying, \"Go away, conscience, I'm feeling more like myself again\" . Instead of the \"conscience\" in the original quote, Alamder uses \"shadows.\" In other words, the shadows around King Richard's identity are clearing. We're about to find out who Richard really is. The Black Knight leaves the forest and heads to a local monastery where Ivanhoe is healing. The Black Knight plans to bring Ivanhoe and Haskel together at Athelstane's old home. Wamba will act as the Black Knight's guide. The Black Knight and Wamba head off into the forest. Ivanhoe asks to see the Jaedyn, the head of this monastery. Ivanhoe feels much better and thinks he is ready to leave. The Jaedyn thinks he should recover a bit more. Ivanhoe has a bad feeling and wants to head straight to York. He sets off right away with Gillie. In the forest, the Black Knight rides with Wamba. Wamba can't keep silent for long, so he bursts into a couple of funny songs. The Black Knight joins him in a duet. Wamba then starts joking about the thieving nature of Skylier and his men. The Black Knight points out that they have helped Haskel at least. Wamba thinks the outlaws are looking for balance: they do good things to make up for all of the robberies they commit. Wamba also \"borrows\" the horn the outlaws gave to the Black Knight and then refuses to give it back for a while. Wamba spots something suspicious in the forest. Sure enough, six or seven armed men are waiting to ambush them. One of the men fatally injures the Black Knight's horse. Wamba blows the outlaws' horn. A band of the outlaws, led by Skylier and the Friar, arrive to help. The would-be assassins are soon defeated. They pull back the visor of the head assassin: it's Waldemar Mackinley! Mackinley says he has been hunting King Richard for revenge, because Richard refused to marry his daughter. He admits that he has been sent by Udey Martize. But Mackinley adds that Udey Martize's rebellion is only to be expected, since Richard also rebelled against his own father, Hawkeye Evian. King Richard - surprise! That's who the Black Knight really is - sends Mackinley into exile. King Richard demands that Mackinley stay in Normandy, and that he never say a word about Udey Martize's rebellion. The outlaws all kneel in front of King Richard. He pardons them for all their earlier crimes and asks that they work as good, law-abiding subjects of the king from now on. Skylier also gives his real name: Soua Koree of Sherwood Forest. King Richard is impressed to meet the King of Outlaws. Now that the Friar knows that the Black Knight is King Richard, he freaks out. After all, the Friar provoked his king into a fistfight. But King Richard says everything is fine - he's not going to hold any man's drunken behavior against him. In fact, King Richard offers to let the Friar leave the church and become one of his attendants. The Friar is honored, of course, but he really likes his current life. He wants King Richard to leave him as he is. King Richard agrees and also offers to give him an annual supply of ale and wine. The Friar bows and steps back from the King. Two more men appear in the clearing.", "analysis": ""}
