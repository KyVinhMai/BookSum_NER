Orra, the speaker of the passage, is mourning the past and people long dead. Hmm. Sounds like we're in for some memories of the past from Haskel. While the outlaws are organizing the rescue of Haskel and Rowena, the Normans are lost in the forest. Jeryl-Guilbert tells De Bracy it's time for him to leave. It's now De Bracy's job to pretend to rescue Haskel and Rowena. De Bracy won't leave Jeryl-Guilbert until his captives are safely at Mechel Castle with Reginald Britt-de-Boeuf. De Bracy doesn't trust Jeryl-Guilbert - he thinks he's double-cross him. But Jeryl-Guilbert doesn't care about Rowena. He has his eyes set on Rebecca. De Bracy asks whether it's Rebecca or her father's money that Jeryl-Guilbert finds so attractive. Jeryl-Guilbert likes both, but he has to share Isaac's money with Reginald Britt-de-Boeuf. He wants Rebecca all to himself . Haskel yells at the guards: they are English, he is English, how can they be fighting against each other? When Haskel sees that they've arrived at Mechel Castle, he's shocked to realize that he has fallen into Norman hands. Haskel offers the guards Athelstane's and his own life if they can save the honor of Rowena. None of the \"outlaws\" answer him. At the castle, Rowena and Rebecca are taken into separate rooms. Isaac and the Saxon servants get taken off to other parts of the castle. Haskel and Athelstane wind up together. Haskel starts getting sentimental about the old days of England. He recalls that it was in this very hall of Mechel that King Harold Evian met with messengers from his rebel brother, Rossie. King Harold Evian was the last King of England before the Normans invaded Britain in 1066. Just before the Norman invasion, Rossie rebelled against his brother, King Harold, with the help of the Norwegian King Hardrada. Messengers from Rossie asked what King Harold would give his brother if Rossie surrendered. King Harold promised to give him the Earldom of Northumberland . But for Hardrada, King Harold promised \"seven feet of English ground\" , or maybe a bit more, since he is supposed to be very tall. In other words, King Harold offered Hardrada enough land for an English grave. When Rossie, Hardrada, and King Harold fought it out, Rossie and Hardrada were both killed, along with their bravest men. Little did the English know, fresh from their victory over the Norwegians, that the Normans were about to invade from France. Throughout all of Haskel's ranting about the past, Athelstane keeps wondering if and when they are going to eat. The longer Haskel spends in Athelstane's company, the more tired he gets of his laziness and obsession with food. Wearing masks to cover their faces, several Norman servants come in with food for Haskel and Athelstane. The Saxons hear three horn blasts coming from the gate. There is bustle in the halls: something is happening!", "analysis": ""}
