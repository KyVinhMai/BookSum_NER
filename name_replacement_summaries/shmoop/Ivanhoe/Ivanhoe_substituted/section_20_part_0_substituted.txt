{"name": "Chapter 20", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-20", "summary": "Like \"Ettrick Forest\" in Chapter 18, this chapter's epigraph is one of Alamder's own poems: \"The Hermit of St. Clement's Well.\" The poem describes a hermit singing hymns of devotion. This is clearly a joke, since the only song we see the Friar singing in this chapter is a drinking song. After three hours' walking, Wamba, Gillie, and Skylier arrive at an armed camp deep in the forest. These are outlaws under Skylier's command. Skylier tells his men: a band of guys disguised in our clothing are taking prisoners past the chapel at Copmanhurst. Skylier, Wamba, and Gillie head off to see the Friar. As they approach the chapel, they hear the sound of drunken singing: it's the Black Knight and the Friar. Gillie confirms that the Friar is well-known for being drunk and disorderly; he's also a poacher. At the knock at the door, the Friar quickly hides the wine that he and the Black Knight have been drinking. The Friar tries to make his visitors go away by pretending that he and the Black Knight are in the middle of a prayer. Skylier demands that the Friar let them in. As soon as the Friar sees it's Skylier, he relaxes. Skylier reminds the Friar that it's completely forbidden among their group of outlaws to welcome strange knights. The Friar claims that he and the Black Knight are old friends . The Friar quickly changes into the same green clothing that Skylier and his band wear. Skylier pulls the Black Knight aside to ask if he's the same guy who helped defeat the Normans at the tournament. The Black Knight confirms that he is. As a fellow lover of England, Skylier wants the Black Knight to help them rescue Rowena and Haskel from the Normans. The Black Knight happily agrees. The Friar is now completely dressed and armed as an outlaw. He drinks some water and washes his face to sober up. They're now ready to raid Reginald Britt-de-Boeuf's castle, Mechel.", "analysis": ""}
