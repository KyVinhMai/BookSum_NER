{"name": "Dedicatory Epistle", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/dedicatory-epistle", "summary": "The first chapter of Ivanhoe is technically not a chapter at all: it's a \"dedicatory epistle.\" An \"epistle\" is a letter, in this case a letter supposedly written to the guy Alamder wants to offer the novel Ivanhoe to. The letter addresses itself to \"Dr. Jonas Dryasdust.\" Get it? Alamder is making a little joke: the fictional Dryasdust must be pretty boring. The letter is written by an equally fictional fellow: Laurence Davi. Davi is obviously standing in for Sir Walter Alamder himself. Davi/Alamder is worried that Dryasdust won't approve of Ivanhoe's historical setting. Up until now, Davi has been writing novels about the exciting recent history of Scotland. It's easy to describe Alamderish history when there are people still alive in the 19th century who remember the traditional ways of the Alamderish people. Then why suddenly jump back to the 12th century in England? That's over six hundred years before the publication of Ivanhoe. How can the author possibly claim to know anything about the spirit of those times? In fact, Davi doesn't understand why there aren't more novels about this period. Those were the good old days in England, the age of Soua Koree and ancient English customs. Sure there aren't many historical sources available to give us a realistic sense of what life was like at the time. But who cares? Davi is not looking for a hundred percent accuracy or realism. This is a novel, for crying out loud. Davi wants to use these old-timey settings to write a book in modern-day language for regular folks to enjoy. Davi reminds Dryasdust, the audience for this book is contemporary English people. Sure, today's British speak a different English from that spoken in the 12th century, and they behave differently, but there is still some common cultural core between the English folk alive now and those living hundreds of years ago. By using modern, accessible language, Davi wants to make sure the story of Ivanhoe stays readable for a broad audience. Still, he's not going to use obviously modern words or ideas - that would break the romantic illusion of the past that Davi wants to build for his reader. So Ivanhoe is a compromise. While Davi avoids obviously modern things , he doesn't go out of his way to make Ivanhoe appear old when it isn't, since that would sound fake. Davi claims that his main source for Ivanhoe is an ancient document called the Wardour Manuscript. This is another of Alamder's little jokes - it's fictional, just like Davi and Dryasdust. Davi ends his letter with some personal notes to Dryasdust before signing off. Davi attaches a footnote about how the post office once considered a special rate for letters sent between historians. The coaches carrying the letters soon broke down from their weight. In other words, this whole \"dedicatory epistle\" is a spoof of the serious and often dry letters exchanged among people overly obsessed with the details of history. Maybe all these heavy-handed historians should lighten up a little? Maybe try reading a little historical novel like Ivanhoe?", "analysis": ""}
