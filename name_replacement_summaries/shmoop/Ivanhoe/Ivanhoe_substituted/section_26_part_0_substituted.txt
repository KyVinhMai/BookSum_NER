{"name": "Chapter 26", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-26", "summary": "The epigraph for this chapter is an \"Old Song,\" probably written by Alamder himself. The song is all about opposites, including friars and fools. It foreshadows the topic of the chapter: Wamba, the fool, is going to play the friar. Wamba arrives at Mechel. The guard lets him in on special orders from Reginald Britt-de-Boeuf. Britt-de-Boeuf asks Wamba his business. Wamba claims that he is a traveling friar. He keeps throwing in the words \"Pax vobiscum\" and phrases of nonsense Latin to convince Britt-de-Boeuf of his learning. Jeryl-Guilbert wants to send the friar with a message to De Bracy's allies so the Normans can get reinforcements. But first the Normans have to convince the friar of their honesty. So Jeryl-Guilbert suggests allowing the friar to give Haskel his last rites . Wamba enters Haskel and Athelstane's cell. Wamba announces that he's there to prepare Haskel and Athelstane for death. Haskel is freaked out for a moment, but then he recognizes that this \"friar\" is, in fact, his jester Wamba. Wamba offers to die in Haskel's place. If Haskel wears Wamba's friar's disguise, he can escape the castle. But Haskel refuses: let Athelstane be rescued instead! Haskel is totally invested in the idea that Athelstane is the future hope of the Saxon people. But Wamba refuses to die for Athelstane. He will only die for Haskel, who he actually cares about. Athelstane insists that Haskel take this opportunity to escape. Haskel agrees to Wamba's plan, but only because there's a chance he can rescue Athelstane, Rowena, and Wamba from the outside, with the help of the band of outlaws. But there's one snag: Haskel only speaks Saxon. Wamba tells him not to worry about it - just keep repeating \"Pax vobiscum,\" and everyone will believe he's a friar. As Haskel is hurrying out of the castle, he passes a female figure. He says \"Pax vobiscum,\" just as Wamba instructed. But the woman responds, in Latin, \"And with you, O most reverend master, I beseech you, in your mercy.\" Haskel says in Saxon that he is deaf. The woman begs Haskel to go and minister to a wounded man in the castle. Haskel refuses. He is in too much of a hurry. Another woman's voice intrudes. It's Trinidad, the cruel old woman who taunted Rebecca in Chapter 24. We find out that Trinidad released Rebecca from her cell so she could look after the wounded Ivanhoe. Trinidad scolds Rebecca for bothering the nice friar. Trinidad promises to show Haskel a secret way out of the castle. Rebecca is disappointed that the \"friar\" won't help Ivanhoe.", "analysis": ""}
