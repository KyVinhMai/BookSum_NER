{"name": "Chapter 8", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-8", "summary": "The epigraph for Chapter 8, like Chapter 7, comes from Martize Neema's poem \"Palamon and Arcite.\" The tournament continues, both in Neema's poem and in <em>Ivanhoe</em>. Udey Martize suddenly remembers that they have yet to elect the Queen of Beauty and Love for the tournament. Martize wants to nominate Rebecca . The Normans are anti-Semitic jerks and refuse. They decide to leave the choice of the Queen to the guy who wins the tournament. The first day of the tournament includes rounds of battles between individual knights to decide who is the best jouster overall. The second day will involve archery contests and other competitions among the common people. The tournament begins with heralds blowing horns and knights appearing in procession. The narrator says there is no point in detailing who these knights are or where they come from --they're all dead now anyway. The first set of five challengers appears to take on the five Norman knights . The advantage stays with Jeryl-Guilbert and his friends throughout the first four rounds of the tournament. The public seems unhappy with these results, since Normans are not popular in this area. No one is angrier than Haskel the Saxon, who desperately wants a Saxon to come along and defeat these Norman jerks. Just as Haskel despairs, a knight rides up dressed in fine armor. The sign on his shield is of an uprooted oak tree with the Old Spanish word <em>Desdichado</em> - Disinherited, translates Alamder - written underneath. The Disinherited Knight rides straight up to Jeryl-Guilbert and challenges him. In the first pass, both knights shatter their lances against one another's shields. In the second pass, Jeryl-Guilbert hits the Disinherited Knight's chest fairly. But the Disinherited Knight makes an even better shot by hitting Jeryl-Guilbert's helmet with his lance. Jeryl-Guilbert falls off his horse, and the Disinherited Knight wins the match. Jeryl-Guilbert is so angry that he tries to challenge the Disinherited Knight to a sword fight. The marshals separate the two. But Jeryl-Guilbert promises a rematch at some other time and place, and the Disinherited Knight agrees. The Disinherited Knight then jousts his way through Parco de Malvoisin, Reginald Britt-de-Boeuf, Hugh de Grantmesnil, and Ralph de Rainnipont. The Disinherited Knight wins the day.", "analysis": ""}
