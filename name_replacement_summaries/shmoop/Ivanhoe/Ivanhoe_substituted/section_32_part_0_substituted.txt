{"name": "Chapter 32", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-32", "summary": "As in Chapter 30, we start with another passage from an \"Old Play,\" actually written by Alamder himself. The passage claims that every group of men, even outlaw groups, have their own laws. It's human nature to have law. Skylier goes to the agreed-upon meeting place with Haskel and the Black Knight. Now that they are back in the forest, Skylier becomes their official leader once again. Skylier asks where the Friar has gotten to. He sends the Raeden to go pull the Friar out of Britt-de-Boeuf's wine cellars. Skylier wants to split up the booty from the raid on Mechel with Haskel. Haskel doesn't want to think about that; he has plenty of money. He is deeply sad because Athelstane has been killed. All he wants to do is thank Skylier's men for their help and go home. Haskel offers Wamba whatever he wants as a reward for his loyalty. Wamba asks for Gillie's freedom. Haskel is so pleased with Gillie that he frees him from his service. Gillie turns to Wamba and says he could also be free if he wanted, but Wamba is happy being Haskel's jester. Rowena arrives at the meeting place surrounded by guards. She thanks Skylier and his men for rescuing her family. Rowena passes by De Bracy, where he is standing as a prisoner. De Bracy asks for her forgiveness. She cannot forgive him for all of the misery he has caused. Rowena moves on. Haskel thanks the Black Knight for all his leadership. Haskel invites the Black Knight back to Rotherwood, where he will be treated as a son or brother. The Black Knight thanks Haskel for his generosity but refuses for now. Instead, somewhere down the line, he intends to ask Haskel for a favor. A procession arrives with Athelstane's body. Skylier offers the Black Knight whatever he wants in terms of spoil from the raid. The Black Knight asks for custody of De Bracy. Skylier agrees, even though De Bracy killed his father. The Black Knight frees De Bracy, but he warns him to be careful in the future. De Bracy walks slowly out of the clearing. At the last minute, he grabs a horse with some of Britt-de-Boeuf's riches and gallops away. Skylier offers the Black Knight the horn that he won for his archery at the tournament at Ashby. If the Black Knight finds himself in trouble, he can blow on this horn and call for help. The outlaws all agree to help the Black Knight if they hear his horn sounding. The Friar arrives with a captive with a rope around his neck. The captive is Isaac, looking deeply miserable. The Friar explains that he went into Britt-de-Boeuf's cellars - just to look around, mind you. He found Isaac there chained to a wall. He spent the evening converting Isaac to Christianity. The outlaws who found the Friar confirm that he was in the cellars, but he was drunk off his head, and Isaac was half-dead. Isaac adds that he couldn't understand a word the Friar was saying. The Friar gets angry with Isaac for denying his conversion to Christianity. The Black Knight stops the Friar from hitting Isaac. The Friar won't free Isaac unless the Black Knight makes him. The Black Knight cheerfully slugs the Friar on the cheek. The Friar falls over backwards and allows Isaac to be freed. The Black Knight plans to ransom Isaac back to his people. Skylier does have one other person to ransom, someone he picked up on the forest road: Jaedyn Aymer himself.", "analysis": ""}
