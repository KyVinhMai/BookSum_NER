They're waiting to ambush Paroles, who is supposed to be trying to retrieve the drum he lost on the battlefield. Paroles shows up and starts talking to himself. He admits that he has no intention of trying to get his drum back. That would be way too dangerous. Instead, he's just going to hang out here for three hours until it's time to go back to the camp. Paroles tries to come up with a story to convince his pals that he got hurt trying to recover the drum. Maybe he should give himself a black eye and a fat lip? Or maybe he should tear his clothes to shreds and break his sword to make it look like he got into a fight with some enemy soldiers? Will his friends even believe his story? The lords Dumaine and the interpreter leap out of the bushes with their swords. Ah ha! They start yelling and speaking in gibberish so Paroles will think they're Russian soldiers. Paroles begs for his life and offers to give them a bunch of information about his unit if they'll spare his life. They blindfold Paroles and a soldier runs off to get Bertram. The proof is in the pudding.", "analysis": ""}
