He shows up in Roussillon and tries to get Lavatch to pass a note to Lafeu. Lavatch isn't in the mood to play go-between. He orders Paroles to stand downwind so he doesn't have to smell him. Then, once again, he bags on his dirty clothes. Lafeu shows up and doesn't immediately recognize Paroles. When he does, he tells him that he deserves everything that's happened to him. Still, he takes pity on him and gives him something to eat.", "analysis": ""}
