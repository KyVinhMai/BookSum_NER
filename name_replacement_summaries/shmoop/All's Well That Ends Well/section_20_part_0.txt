As we know, the King isn't there. They bump into an austringer and find out that the King is actually in Roussillon, which means the women had traveled all this way for nothing. Helen is not about to give up. She laces up her riding shoes and says \"All's well that ends well yet, / Though time seem so adverse, and means unfit.\" Helen then passes the austringer a note and promises him a bunch of money if he gives it to the King for her. Helen and company saddle up for the trip to Roussillon.", "analysis": ""}
