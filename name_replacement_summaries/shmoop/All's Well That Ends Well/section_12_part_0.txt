Bertram has become a famous war hero and everyone wants a piece of him before his fifteen minutes of fame are up. A widow and her daughter are watching the guys return from battle. It turns out that Bertram's pal Paroles has solicited Diana on Bertram's behalf. Then a woman named Mariana warns Diana that a girl's reputation is EVERYTHING, so she should stay away from Paroles and Bertram. We find out that Bertram is a love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy. With Paroles' help, he's been going around seducing Italian virgins and ruining their reputations. Diana's not worried about it. She's a smart girl and knows enough to stay away from the likes of Bertram. Just then, Helen shows up wearing her pilgrim get-up. She says she's on her way to the shrine of St. Jaques and wants the name of the motel where all the other pilgrims stay. We interrupt this program for a geography lesson. We plotted out Helen's little road trip on Google Maps and found out that our girl is a WAY off course. If Helen started out in Roussillon and is headed for St. Jaques' shrine , what the heck is she doing in Florence, Italy? Did Shakespeare snooze his way through his European geography class, or did Helen decide to take a detour so she could track down her husband? You decide. The widow just so happens to be an inn keeper so she invites Helen to stay at her place. She also shares some local gossip with Helen. There's a yummy French soldier living in Florence. Word on the street is that he ran away from home because the king married him against his will. Helen's ears perk up. The widow tells her that Bertram has been trying to seduce her virginal daughter but that Diana won't have any of it. Just then, Bertram and his army march by. Diana sighs and says Bertram sure is dreamy. It's just too bad that he's always trying to cheat on his poor wife. When the ladies spot Paroles, they start to heckle him. Diana calls him a \"jackanapes\" and the widow yells out \"Marry, hang you!\" Taunting Paroles has made the ladies hungry, and they run off to grab a bite to eat together.", "analysis": ""}
