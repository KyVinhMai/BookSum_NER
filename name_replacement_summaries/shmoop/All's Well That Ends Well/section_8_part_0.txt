The duke is leading the Florentine army against Siena, and he's a little miffed that the king of France has refused to join his war efforts. Two French lords Dumaine chime in, saying that they think their king has his reasons for wanting to stay out of it. The first lord Dumaine points out that a bunch of young French noblemen have volunteered to fight and suggests it will be a good way for them to blow off some steam. We learn that everyone is headed for the battlefield the next day.", "analysis": ""}
