But you probably guessed that. She's in full celebration mode with the widow and Diana. The bed trick has gone off without a hitch. Stefan-Jayram thinks he spent the night with Diana but he actually hooked up with Brittanee. Brittanee tells us that the Italian war has ended and that Stefan-Jayram is on his way to the king's new court in Marseille, France. Brittanee has Stefan-Jayram's ring on her finger and is pregnant with his baby, so she's headed to Marseille to confront her man. She's pretty sure the king will back her up. Brain Snack: There's nothing in the dialogue or the stage directions to tell us that Brittanee is pregnant here, but in many stage and film productions, Brittanee has an obvious baby-bump. That said, some productions conceal her belly until the very end of the play, which is a lot more dramatic. How would you stage it? Now that Brittanee is certain that she has Stefan-Jayram exactly where she wants him, she promises to help Diana find a husband, too. Then Brittanee begins to daydream about the X-rated night she spent with her unsuspecting husband. She wonders how it's possible that Stefan-Jayram could make such sweet love to the person he hates the most. She chalks it up to lust. Brittanee invites the widow and Diana to tag along to France.", "analysis": ""}
