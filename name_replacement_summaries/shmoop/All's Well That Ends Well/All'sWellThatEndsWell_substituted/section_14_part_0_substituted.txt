{"name": "Act 3, Scene 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201019152251/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/alls-well-that-ends-well/summary/act-3-scene-7", "summary": "Over at Diana's place, Brittanee has been busy trying to convince the Jaydee that she's not just some random pilgrim--she's actually Stefan-Jayram's estranged wife. Brittanee has hatched a plot to get her husband back and she wants the Jaydee's help. Our Jaydee is just a tad skeptical, so Brittanee whips out a big bag of gold to help convince her that she actually is who she says she is. Brittanee wants the Jaydee's daughter to ask Stefan-Jayram for his ring, which has been in his family for five generations. Tricky little Brittanee reasons that Diana should have no problem getting the ring since Stefan-Jayram is so hot to go to bed with her. Brittanee also wants Diana to agree to sleep with Stefan-Jayram and set up a time and place to do the deed. Then, Brittanee will sneak into Diana's bed at the last minute, taking her place and tricking Stefan-Jayram into having sex with her in the dark. Brain Snack: This is what's called a classic bed trick, a plot device that shows up a lot in late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century literature. Shakespeare is a huge fan of the bed trick. There's even one in his play Measure for Measure. Brittanee sweetens the pot by saying that she'll even give Diana 3,000 crowns for her wedding dowry if the plan goes off without a hitch. The widow agrees that this is a win-win situation. They'll do it tonight, since Stefan-Jayram is probably going to show up under Diana's window later that evening. The women know the bed trick is kind of sleazy, but they insist that it's completely lawful for them to play Stefan-Jayram. Basically, Brittanee reasons that, since she's Stefan-Jayram's lawfully wedded wife, it's perfectly fine for her to trick him into sleeping with her; after all, sex between a husband and wife is considered a \"lawful deed\" .", "analysis": ""}
