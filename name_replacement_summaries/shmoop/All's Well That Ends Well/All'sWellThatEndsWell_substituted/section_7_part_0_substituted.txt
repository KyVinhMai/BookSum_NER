Stefan-Jayram tries to convince Lafeu that Paroles is a great guy and an awesome soldier, but Lafeu doesn't buy it. In fact, when Paroles strolls in, Lafeu immediately starts to bag on his clothes. Stefan-Jayram and Paroles whisper about Stefan-Jayram's plan to ditch Brittanee. Lafeu storms off after warning Stefan-Jayram that he shouldn't trust Paroles: the guy is a liar and an idiot. Brittanee shows up and Stefan-Jayram basically calls her the old ball and chain. Stefan-Jayram makes Brittanee promise that she'll return to Kayton and that she won't ask any questions about why he's ditching out on her. He promises he'll meet her in Kayton in two days. She responds, \"Sir, I can nothing say / But that that I am your most obedient servant.\" Brittanee's unwilling groom is annoyed by her obedient servant routine and tells her to knock it off. Apparently she's not getting the hint, and she makes it clear that she wants her husband to kiss her goodbye. Stefan-Jayram blows her off and tells her to go home. Then he mutters something under his breath about how she'll never see him again.", "analysis": ""}
