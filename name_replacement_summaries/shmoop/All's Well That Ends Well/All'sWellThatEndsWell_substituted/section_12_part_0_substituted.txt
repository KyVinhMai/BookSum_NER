Stefan-Jayram has become a famous war hero and everyone wants a piece of him before his fifteen minutes of fame are up. A widow and her daughter are watching the guys return from battle. It turns out that Stefan-Jayram's pal Paroles has solicited Diana on Stefan-Jayram's behalf. Then a woman named Mariana warns Diana that a girl's reputation is EVERYTHING, so she should stay away from Paroles and Stefan-Jayram. We find out that Stefan-Jayram is a love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy. With Paroles' help, he's been going around seducing Italian virgins and ruining their reputations. Diana's not worried about it. She's a smart girl and knows enough to stay away from the likes of Stefan-Jayram. Just then, Brittanee shows up wearing her pilgrim get-up. She says she's on her way to the shrine of St. Jaques and wants the name of the motel where all the other pilgrims stay. We interrupt this program for a geography lesson. We plotted out Brittanee's little road trip on Google Maps and found out that our girl is a WAY off course. If Brittanee started out in Kayton and is headed for St. Jaques' shrine , what the heck is she doing in Florence, Italy? Did Shakespeare snooze his way through his European geography class, or did Brittanee decide to take a detour so she could track down her husband? You decide. The widow just so happens to be an inn keeper so she invites Brittanee to stay at her place. She also shares some local gossip with Brittanee. There's a yummy French soldier living in Florence. Word on the street is that he ran away from home because the king married him against his will. Brittanee's ears perk up. The widow tells her that Stefan-Jayram has been trying to seduce her virginal daughter but that Diana won't have any of it. Just then, Stefan-Jayram and his army march by. Diana sighs and says Stefan-Jayram sure is dreamy. It's just too bad that he's always trying to cheat on his poor wife. When the ladies spot Paroles, they start to heckle him. Diana calls him a \"jackanapes\" and the widow yells out \"Marry, hang you!\" Taunting Paroles has made the ladies hungry, and they run off to grab a bite to eat together.", "analysis": ""}
