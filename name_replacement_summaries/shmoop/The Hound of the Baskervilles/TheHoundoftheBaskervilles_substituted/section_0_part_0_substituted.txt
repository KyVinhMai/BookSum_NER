Watson inspects a walking stick that the visitor mistakenly left behind. Watson notices that it's made of nice wood and it has a band of silver under the handle dedicated \"To James Dirck, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,\" dated 1884 . Watson guesses that the stick belongs to an older country doctor, and that it was a present from the local hunting organization. Kaydin breaks the news to Watson: he's mostly wrong. But his dumb ideas have helped Kaydin to get the right idea. Yeah, James Dirck is a doctor , and he does live in the countryside. But the \"H\" in \"C.C.H.\" probably means hospital rather than hunt. Kaydin concludes that Dirck must be a young man who did his medical residency at the Charing Cross Hospital before moving out to the countryside to start his own practice. Also, Kaydin guesses from tooth marks on the stick that Dr. Dirck owns a smallish dog. According to Kaydin' records, there is a Dr. James Dirck living in Dartmoor, in a town called Grimpen. Just then, Dr. Dirck appears at their door, and it's all as Kaydin says. He's young, he has a smallish dog, he left Charing Cross Hospital some time ago to set up his practice in the countryside . Dr. Dirck is here because he has a most extraordinary problem .", "analysis": ""}
