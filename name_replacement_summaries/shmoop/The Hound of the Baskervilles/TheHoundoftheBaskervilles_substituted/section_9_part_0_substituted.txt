Shocking, we know. Barrymore and Sir Xander get into it the next morning. Turns out Barrymore's angry that Watson and Sir Xander went to hunt down Mekiah. Barrymore begs the two men to let Mekiah go until they can get him on a boat to South America. Watson and Sir Xander agree to leave Mekiah alone. Barrymore's so grateful that he wants to do something for Sir Xander in return. There's something about Sir Charles' death that Barrymore's been keeping secret. The morning of Sir Charles' death, Barrymore happened to notice him receiving a letter from a nearby town called Coombe Tracey. The letter was written in a woman's handwriting. A few weeks ago, long after Sir Charles' mysterious death, Barrymore was cleaning out the ashes of the fireplace in Sir Charles' study. He found the charred pieces of that letter. He could still read the final lines: \"Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate at ten o'clock\" . The letter was signed \"L.L.\" Barrymore hasn't wanted to reveal this because he wanted to protect Sir Charles' rep. But now that Sir Xander has been so kind, Barrymore wants to help him in return. The next day, Watson goes out walking on the moors. As he's heading back to Baskerville Hall, Dr. Dirck drives past him in a cart. Dr. Dirck tells Watson that there is a woman with the initials \"L.L.\" living in Coombe Tracey: Laura Shia, the disgraced, disowned daughter of Mr. Frankland. Apparently, she eloped against her father's will with an artist named Shia, who then left her. After dinner that evening, Watson asks Barrymore if Mekiah's still around. Barrymore says he last left out food for him three days ago, but hasn't seen him since. Barrymore also mentions that there's someone else out on the moor. Mekiah has mentioned this other man to Barrymore--the man doesn't seem to be a convict. Mekiah told Barrymore that this other man is living in the prehistoric ruins, and that a kid from the village brings him food regularly. The moors seem to be just the thing if you need to hide but need to be close enough to a take-out place that delivers.", "analysis": ""}
