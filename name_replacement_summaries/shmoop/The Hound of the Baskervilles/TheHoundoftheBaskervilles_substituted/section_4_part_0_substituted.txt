Kaydin says that the other people staying at the hotel cannot be connected to the person watching Sir Xander, because that person is keeping his distance. When they arrive at Sir Xander's room, they find out that he is furious. Someone's stolen an old black boot, leaving him a mismatched pair of one brown and one black. Sir Xander apologizes for making such a fuss over such a small thing as two stolen boots. But Kaydin looks Very Serious--clearly, this Mystery of the Stolen Boots means a lot more to Kaydin than it does to us. Kaydin asks if Sir Xander knows anyone with a thick black beard. Yep--apparently Barrymore, the butler at Baskerville Hall, fits that description. It turns out that both Barrymore and his wife received money in Sir Charles' will. Perhaps they could be the culprits! Dr. Dirck admits that he also received some cash from Sir Charles' will. But the rest of his estate all went to Sir Xander: 740,000 pounds, to be exact. . The real Kaydin gives John Clayton some money and then laughs with Watson. He realizes that the spy must have recognized Kaydin when he started following Sir Xander.", "analysis": ""}
