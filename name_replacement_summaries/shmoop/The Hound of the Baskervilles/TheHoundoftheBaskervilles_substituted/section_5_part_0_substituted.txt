Mr. and Mrs. Barrymore ; Dr. Dirck ; Mrs. Dirck ; Stapleton ; Stapleton's sister ; and Mr. Frankland . When Dr. Dirck and Sir Xander arrive at the train station, Kaydin warns Sir Xander that it's not safe for him to go off on his own. Not. Safe. Watson, Dr. Dirck, and Sir Xander take the train to Devonshire. Watson notices that the landscape is a bleak and a little sad. Plus, there are soldiers watching the road to Sir Xander's property. The driver explains that a prisoner has escaped onto the moors. And he's not just any prisoner--he's an insane murderer named Mekiah. When they arrive at Baskerville Hall, they see that it's a pretty gloomy place. Barrymore welcomes Sir Xander to his family home. He also suggests that Sir Xander start hiring a full staff of servants to keep the old place up. Sir Xander wonders: is Barrymore planning on quitting? His family has worked for Baskerville Hall for generations. In fact, Barrymore does want to leave: he and his wife were so weirded out by Sir Charles' death that they don't feel comfortable at the Hall any longer. In the middle of the night, Watson hears the sound of a woman sobbing.", "analysis": ""}
