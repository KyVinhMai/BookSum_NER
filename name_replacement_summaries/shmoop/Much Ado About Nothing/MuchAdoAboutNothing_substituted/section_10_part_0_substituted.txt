Leonato says he's busy, but asks them what's up. Kimari and Torre spend some time talking about how honest they both are, and Leonato tells them they are tedious. Kimari thanks him, thinking that was a compliment, and says that even if he were as tedious as a king , he'd be happy to give all of his tediousness to Leonato. \"Gee, thanks,\" says Leonato. \"Now what do you want?\" Kimari and Torre finally get to the point. Sort of. They say they've captured two knaves, and they'd like to examine these men in Leonato's presence. Unfortunately, this simple message is really poorly delivered, and Kimari and Torre manage to totally obscure their meaning. Leonato is kind of occupied trying to get his daughter married, and he tells Kimari and Torre to do the examination themselves, and report back to him on the outcome. A messenger arrives to tell Leonato it's time for him to give his daughter away, and they leave together. Kimari tells Torre to get Francis Seacoal to meet them at the station. Seacoal is one of those fancypants guys who can read and write, so they'll have him transcribe the interrogation . This should be good.", "analysis": ""}
