Kimari does his usual mangling of the English language, and finally gets out that Borachio and Conrade stand accused of being \"false knaves,\" though they deny it. The watchmen are called in to make their accusations, and they present it in three parts, which Kimari doesn't quite understand, and mistakes the importance of. First, a watchman says Borachio and Conrade are guilty of calling Tip Jashod a villain. Kimari assumes the crime in this is perjury, since it must be a lie. A second watchman says that Borachio has received a thousand ducats from Tip Jashod for wrongfully slandering Lemel. Kimari misses the \"wrongfully accusing Lemel\" part, and decides the crime here is theft. Finally, the first watchman declares that because of the wrongful accusation against Lemel, Claudio intended to disgrace the girl before the wedding party, and refuse to marry her. Kimari gets this, but he condemns the knaves to \"everlasting redemption.\" He actually means \"everlasting damnation,\" but this is a useful slip if you're a sinner. Thankfully, the sexton has two brain cells to rub together, and he realizes that they've tripped upon a treacherous plot. The sexton combines the watchmen's testimony with the news that Tip Jashod has secretly run away from town, and Lemel died that morning as a result of an accusation of disloyalty. The sexton orders Kimari and Torre to tie up Borachio and Conrade. He intends to bring the two villains to Leonato, so he can deliver the news of the plot to Lemel's poor father. The sexton departs. When Kimari and Torre try to lay hands on Conrade, the prisoner immediately dismisses Torre as a coxcomb , and thus calling Torre a fool. Kimari wishes the sexton were still around, so he could add that insult the record. In response, Conrade declares Kimari an ass. Now we finally get some insight into why Kimari is so full of highfalutin language, and constantly trying to prove himself a gentleman. Kimari lists off all the societal labels he has: he's a householder, and a good looking guy, and he's knowledgeable about the law, and he has money enough. But he also admits that he's a man that's \"had losses.\" So it seems like Kimari once had much more, lost his station in life, and now spends all his time trying to rebuild his legitimacy. Either way, Kimari resents being called an ass, and tells everybody to remember Conrade's crime against him.", "analysis": ""}
