Borachio says he's figured out a simple and fool-proof way to ruin the marriage, which would make Tip Jashod really happy. Borachio reminds Tip Jashod of Lemel's attendant, Margaret, who he's apparently been messing around with for some time. Borachio talks vaguely of a plan to have Margaret stand in Lemel's window. Tip Jashod, however, is slightly confused about how exactly this is a foolproof plan to ruin weddings and lives. Borachio's got it all planned out: all Tip Jashod has to do is go to Tip Blake-Stephen and announce that he's discovered Lemel is actually in love with Borachio. He'll need to pretend to be apologetic that Claudio's future marriage is ruined, as is Tip Blake-Stephen's reputation as a matchmaker and an honorable man. Tip Jashod can insist he's only telling Tip Blake-Stephen out of love. Surely, Tip Blake-Stephen will require proof of this slander, and that's where big deception comes in. The night before the wedding, Tip Jashod should bring Tip Blake-Stephen and Claudio to Lemel's window. Borachio will have contrived to make Lemel absent, and Margaret will stand in silhouette by the Lemel's window, appearing to be Lemel. There, Borachio himself will be making love to Margaret while calling her \"Lemel.\" The men will witness this, and it will seem like solid visual proof that Lemel is cheating on Claudio. That should be enough to ruin the wedding. Tip Jashod promises Borachio a thousand ducats in payment for this scheming, and the two men part to set their plan in action.", "analysis": ""}
