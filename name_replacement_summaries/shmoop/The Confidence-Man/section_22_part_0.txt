PIO had mentioned this was his stop. This makes Pitch associate disease and corruption with PIO. The association makes Pitch suspect that he was swindled. Pitch muses over how this occurred and thinks about PIO's threadbare outfit, jovial but slippery words, and sly facial expressions. In the throes of these unhappy thoughts, a stranger comes up to Pitch and offers the metaphorical penny to know what his thoughts are.", "analysis": ""}
