Egbert confidently sits down at the table, praises Winsome, and asks if Frank thinks he's great, too. Frank does a little fancy footwork in getting away with not saying that Winsome is the best thing since sliced bread. He still really wants to know about the dude's philosophy, though. Egbert is eager to begin, but Frank stops him: I don't want a lecture, I want a lesson. The guys agree to role-play a case of Frank's invention. Frank will be Frank, and Egbert will play a guy named Charlie. Stop us if you've heard this one before, but Frank and Charlie in this scenario are longtime friends since childhood, and Frank needs to borrow money. Yeah.", "analysis": ""}
