He's not wrong. But the honeymoon isn't quite over yet, because something really weird happens. While Charlie is saying mean angry things to Frank, Frank takes out ten coins and places them in a circle around Charlie. Frank steps back, waves his pipe like a wand, and says some mysterious magic words. Inside the circle, Charlie is in a honest-to-goodness trance. Frank commands that the old happy Charlie return when he says the words \"my dear Frank.\" Frank concludes the spell, and Charlie says a lot of things. What else is new? Apparently, Charlie is under the impression that Frank was just joking about needing money and says that being a mean jerk-face when he asked for it was all a joke. These guys--such tricksters. Charlie says they should keep drinking, and Frank is up for it. Frank says Charlie was so clever in how he played along and pretended to be angry about the money. Charlie: Well, I used to do theater. So kinda got this acting thing down. Frank: You're a gem. Want to hear about Charlemont? Charlie: Oh, yeah, for sure--who?", "analysis": ""}
