At least that's the cosmopolitan's response to the new guy's assertion at the end of the last chapter. Don't judge him, dude, he says. You don't know him. He's got a hard shell, but a heart of gold. The new guy is glad to hear it. On to more important things: the cosmopolitan thinks the story of Colonel Moredock is a tall tale. How could a guy with so much hate love the rest of humanity? That's just not sound reasoning, bro. The cosmopolitan also makes a case for misanthropy being akin to atheism: one denies kindness in humans just like the other denies love as something ordering the world. The two men bond over not having a frame of reference for determining what it means to be a misanthrope. They both just love humanity oh so much. The new guy wants to shake hands with the cosmopolitan because they're, like, so much alike. The men shake hands. The new guy says that now that they're besties, he and the cosmopolitan have to do what besties do best: drink together. The cosmopolitan would love to do that, totally, yeah, but he can't, because he already had too much while catching up with his other friends. Hold the phone. New guy is totally jealous that the cosmopolitan has other friends. But he tries to shake it off and act cool. You can have a little wine, the new guy says. Just a little. New guy is such an enabler. The cosmopolitan gets up and caves. He's so down.", "analysis": ""}
