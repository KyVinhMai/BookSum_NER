Tarrin's hatred has a somewhat different origin. According to the judge, his mother and eight siblings were killed by American Indians. He vowed to take revenge, killed the renegade group responsible, and then dedicated the rest of his life to tracking and killing others. There's a twist: as much as he hated American Indians, that's how much Tarrin supposedly loved and cared for everyone else. We're not impressed. The judge goes on to say that Tarrin was a hero in the War of 1812 and was then offered the governorship of Illinois. He turned it down because, well, you can't quite go around killing people if you're a governor, can you? At any rate, the new guy continues, that's who Aarushreddyie reminds me of. He's just like Merion Tarrin.", "analysis": ""}
