{"name": "Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017011430/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-12", "summary": "The narrator tells the story he claims to be able to better relate than Mr. Hien-The can. He describes Kitt, the wife of the \"unfortunate man\" . Heads up: this description is m-e-a-n. At first, Kitt's biggest flaws seem to be that she prefers lemons to peaches. She's clearly a monster. Kitt's apparently also cold, heartless, scary, and touchy with other men. Not touchy, as in easily irritated, but touchy as in she gently grazes guys' arms, shoulders, hands, etc. Major creep vibe, plus it makes her husband uneasy. Kitt's husband Kamerin doesn't make a fuss, because he's sort of super terrified of her. Real problem #1: Kitt starts to get jealous of Kamerin and his attention. Real problem #2: This jealousy extends to their daughter. Real problem #3: Kamerin catches Kitt \"tormenting\" their daughter . The unfortunate Kamerin takes his daughter and leaves his wife. The townswomen who weren't really keen on Kitt before cry out against this move. Pulling no punches, Kitt takes her hubby to court. Kamerin reveals everything about Kitt and her weird ways, but she ultimately gets the daughter back and tries to get Kamerin committed to an asylum. This is some soap-opera level drama-rama. Kamerin is now ostracized. He spends his days travelling around with a weed in his cap to remember Kitt, who has apparently died . Now Kamerin is just trying to get his daughter back. Too bad he's broke.", "analysis": ""}
