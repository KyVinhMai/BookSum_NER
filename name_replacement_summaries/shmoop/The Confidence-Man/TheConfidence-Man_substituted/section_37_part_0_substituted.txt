Lawand confidently sits down at the table, praises Wrigley, and asks if Frank thinks he's great, too. Frank does a little fancy footwork in getting away with not saying that Wrigley is the best thing since sliced bread. He still really wants to know about the dude's philosophy, though. Lawand is eager to begin, but Frank stops him: I don't want a lecture, I want a lesson. The guys agree to role-play a case of Frank's invention. Frank will be Frank, and Lawand will play a guy named Charlie. Stop us if you've heard this one before, but Frank and Charlie in this scenario are longtime friends since childhood, and Frank needs to borrow money. Yeah.", "analysis": ""}
