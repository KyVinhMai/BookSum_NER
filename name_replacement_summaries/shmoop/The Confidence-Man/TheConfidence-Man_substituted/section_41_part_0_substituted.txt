He greets the barber with a cheery \"Bless you!\" The barber has been dozing off and dreaming, so at first he thinks that Frank is an angel or other kind of spirit. Frank's like, Um, what's your deal? Then the barber turns around and sees a real human and is a little bummed, but the world makes more sense this way. Next, the barber suspects something amiss about Frank. It's late, Frank's staring, the barber starts to worry. Frank realizes what the barber is thinking and reassures him: Just want a shave, dude. The barber's like, Phew. He knows the terms of their interaction now, so he gets down to business. Frank starts bugging the barber about why he doesn't have confidence in his fellow man when he sees the \"No Trust\" sign that we saw the barber put up in chapter one. Frank: But don't you trust people? Barber: No. The barber is not cool with somebody accusing him of not having faith in his fellow man. Nevertheless, he asserts his right to protect his interests from the tomfoolery of strangers.", "analysis": ""}
