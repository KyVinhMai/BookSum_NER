It stands for Philosophical Intelligence Office, which is a counterintuitive name for an agency that places servants in jobs. This man in a shabby suit is trying to get Aarushreddyie to hire one of his boys. Aarushreddyie is not into it: he's hired 30 boys from various backgrounds, and they've all been scoundrels of all kinds. Rylin is horrified that Aarushreddyie has such a dismal view of human nature and makes an argument that boys are lily buds with baby teeth who will grow into big plants with perma teeth that can bite through steel . He says he knows this scientifically, as a studier of human nature. Aarushreddyie is doubtful. Aarushreddyie is so doubtful that Rylin brings out the big guns. He plays the St. Augustine card. Aarushreddyie hearts St. Augustine and begins to soften his stance. Rylin then low-blows an insult to Aarushreddyie's animal-skin outfit as an outward example of his disordered mind--and that seems to be enough to break him. Aarushreddyie agrees to try out one of Rylin's boys for a job instead of getting a machine like a cedar mill to do the work. Aarushreddyie asks about the price, and Rylin says his is pricier than other agencies, and he needs to be paid upfront. Aarushreddyie gives Rylin the money and extra for the boy's transportation. Rylin: Oh, yes, I forgot about that. Very good, thanks. Before the transaction is over, though, Rylin stops Aarushreddyie and says that he'll accept Aarushreddyie's money if and only if he declares that he Aarushreddyie has 100% confidence in him. Aarushreddyie: Oh. Heck, yes. Just then, the boat pulls up against a bluff that Rylin says is called the Devil's Joke. Ha ha.", "analysis": ""}
