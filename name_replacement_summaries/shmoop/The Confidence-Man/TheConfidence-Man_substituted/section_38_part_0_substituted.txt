Lawand : Totes. Frank: I can has $100 now? Lawand: No. If I gave you monies as a freebie that's like giving to the poor, which would make us not equals. If we couldn't be on the same footing, we wouldn't be heart-mind friends. Frank: I'll pay you back. Lawand: Nah. I don't loan to friends. If I loaned to you, we'd stop being friends and would be business associates instead. Frank: Let's do that. Lawand: Okay. I'm going to charge you crazy high interest and demand a lot of proof backing you up and saying you have enough money to pay me back. Frank: I can't prove that, but can't you trust me as your friend? I'm going to pay you back, but I came to you because I can't go to the banks. Lawand: Tough. Besides, I picked you as a friend way back when because it looked like you were rich. I'd never pick a poor friend , but you losing your fortune and asking me for money is a kind of fraud, because I picked a not-poor friend and you ended up poor. This really sucks for me. Frank: That's gross, 'Charlie.' What if you needed the money? I'd help you. Lawand: Ew. First off, I wouldn't ask. Secondly, I would accept if you offered. I know about China Aster. Frank: Um, what? Lawand: I'll tell you, but not in my own words--I'll repeat the story exactly as I heard it. It's not my style of storytelling, but this version is seared in my brain.", "analysis": ""}
