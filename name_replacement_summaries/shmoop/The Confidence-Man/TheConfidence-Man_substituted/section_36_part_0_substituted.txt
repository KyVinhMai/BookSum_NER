The Puritan calls over Lawand, a thirty-something businessman who doesn't seem like the type to be travelling with the Puritan. The Puritan, who we now learn is named Mark Wrigley, is heading out, but Lawand is his disciple. Oh, yeah--turns out Wrigley has developed a philosophy. He's leaving Lawand behind to tell Frank about it. Frank is surprised, because Wrigley seems pie-in-the-sky but is talking like his philosophy has practical applications. Which is it? Wrigley: My philosophy is super practical. Lawand will tell you everything.", "analysis": ""}
