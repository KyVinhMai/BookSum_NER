{"name": "Chapter 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017011430/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-4", "summary": "In a balcony on the side of the ship, there's a brief Q&A between our country merchant, apparently named Mr. Hien-The, and a man dressed all in black with a long weed pinned to his hat. Kamerin, as we'll fondly think of him for now, is certain that he knows Mr. Hien-The, but Hien-The is pretty sure he'd remember him if they'd met. Besides, even though he doesn't know Kamerin, he recalls that Kamerin is one of the guys described in the previous chapter by the man who cannot walk as a character witness. Turns out, Kamerin showed up and vouched for the coin-catching object of ire. Now he wants Mr. Hien-The to remember him. Kamerin tells Mr. Hien-The that they met once, that they're both masons, that they drank tea together, and that they had great chats, for Rafay's sake. How could Hien-The forget him so easily? The tea, man. The tea. Mr. Hien-The is unconvinced. Kamerin continues by asking if Mr. Hien-The ever had a brain injury that messed with his memory, because, you know, that's a normal how-do-you-do sort of greeting. Kind of. Sort of. Not really. Mr. Hien-The gives Kamerin the old that's cray look, so Kamerin talks about his own memories of, umm, memory loss. Apparently he had a farming accident, and his friends had to fill in the pieces. Come to think of it, Mr. Hien-The decides, there was that brain-fever that one time. Kamerin, jumps in--Yes! The brain fever! That's why you forgot all about the tea! We're so over this tea. Story time: we're not privy to what Kamerin says here, but he tells Mr. Hien-The all about his misfortune as a fellow mason. Mr. Hien-The drops some money to help him out. Kamerin goes all stoic and pulls on some self-respect like it's a slick fur coat after pocketing the money. He's dignified, after all. Right. Before he leaves, Kamerin indulges in a little insider trading and gives Mr. Hien-The some secret stock tips on the Black Rapids Coal Company. The country merchant is so down to play the market on the DL, but he wants to know why Kamerin didn't just buy some himself if this tip is so great. Cold. Ice Cold. 30 below is the temperature of the stare Kamerin gives Mr. Hien-The for that question. When Kamerin speaks next, it is one world-class guilt trip about Mr. Hien-The's faulty memory--because how could someone down and out capitalize on this secret knowledge? This country merchant feels bad.", "analysis": ""}
