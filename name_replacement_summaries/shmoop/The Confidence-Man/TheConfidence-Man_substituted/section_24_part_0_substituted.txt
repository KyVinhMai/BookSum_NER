He comments on Aarushreddyie's misanthropy and compares him to the \"Indian-hating\" Merion Scion Tarrin of Illinois. The cosmopolitan doesn't know who that is, but he's shocked that anyone would hate Indians. He has a moment of fetishizing the other with his Pocahontas was super-cool opinions. The new guy says he knows all about Tarrin; plus, when he was a kid, he and his dad rested their horses at the dude's cabin once. He peeked into the Merion's room but only found a squirrel instead of the napping man who was supposed to be there. The cosmopolitan agrees to hear more about this Indian-hating man with a rifle. That'll be in the next chapter, though.", "analysis": ""}
