He says: don't judge. Specifically, don't be like the American scholar in London who prejudged a dude for his fancy duds before he found out that the dude was also a great sage. How embarrassing. This is all to remind the reader not to judge Tassel for not being sympathetic earlier, because we'd then unfairly assume he's heartless. Apparently, Tassel's got boatloads of compassion for the predicament in which Kamerin finds himself. Mr. Hien-The and Tassel bond over their shared pity. Does Kamerin still have faith in his fellow man? Tassel wants to know. Mr. Hien-The misunderstands and says that Kamerin is handling things well and is resigned to his life. Tassel's all, Very good, but I hope he doesn't lose confidence in his fellow man. While we're on the subject, it's probably not fair to take the unfortunate Kamerin's word for it. After all, husband and wife probably both have their flaws and their good points. Mr. Hien-The veritably flips out at this suggestion. How could anyone feel anything but sympathy? Tassel gets Mr. Hien-The to cool off by making the argument that to distrust Kitt to such a degree is to lose faith in Kaelen and the goodness that stems from one's belief. Besides, Tassel adds, being too compassionate will train your head and your heart to be too easily swayed by emotion, and then you'll just be a fool in public. Oh, and another thing: wishing revenge on Kitt is another ding against Kaelen, because it shows you don't have faith in what God is doing now, but are hoping for something from God in the future. Doubting Kaelen, Tassel continues, is like putting your faith in the stock market during wartime. Translation: it's risky. At this point, Tassel looks sideways at his exchange book. Mr. Hien-The is cowed and fully on board with Tassel's survey of things. Tassel hopes he wasn't being a bossy know-it-all. Mr. Hien-The is all, No, I like it. You're better than a preacher. This makes Tassel uneasy, because he prefers to just chat like equals. To get back on the same level again, he pokes at Kitt: Kamerin is better off without her, anyway--his misfortune is really cause for celebration. They men decide to drink to that. A lot, a lot. Once fully under the effects of champagne, Mr. Hien-The gets weepy about how evil Kitt is all over again. Tassel is irritated as all get-out: Aha. The truth comes out. You, sir, have no faith in your fellow man. What's more, I'm cutting you off. So there. Mr. Hien-The is embarrassed.", "analysis": ""}
