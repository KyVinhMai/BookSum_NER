Rylin had mentioned this was his stop. This makes Aarushreddyie associate disease and corruption with Rylin. The association makes Aarushreddyie suspect that he was swindled. Aarushreddyie muses over how this occurred and thinks about Rylin's threadbare outfit, jovial but slippery words, and sly facial expressions. In the throes of these unhappy thoughts, a stranger comes up to Aarushreddyie and offers the metaphorical penny to know what his thoughts are.", "analysis": ""}
