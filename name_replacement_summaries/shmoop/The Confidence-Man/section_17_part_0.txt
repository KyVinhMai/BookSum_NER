They disagree over whether it was fair that he was exposed as a fake. One thinks he's a clear charlatan, while the other only accuses him of being a fool. Suddenly, the herb-doctor returns, asking for the man collecting money for the Seminole Widow and Orphan Asylum . The herb-doctor says he always donates half of his sales to charity. There's no response from the crowd. Been there, done that. The herb-doctor keeps offering the money, saying he'll give to anyone connected with another charity, whether they have a certificate to prove it or not, because he trusts them out of the goodness of his heart. People shuffle their feet but don't speak. A woman stands to get the money. The crowd side-eyes her until she sits down. Then the herb-doctor says that anyone in need can just have it. Another woman in clear mourning garb starts weeping, but she doesn't move to get the cash. Eventually, a man with a bandage across his face goes to claim the money. As the man with the bandage heads back to where he was standing, camp-charlatan guy stops him and asks to see the coins. He's surprised that they're real silver. Camp-fool guy is not surprised. Now they disagree over whether this was sincere or whether it was part of another bizarre ploy. A third guy interjects. Giddy for gossip, he says he knows what's up. The crowd asks what's up. New guy says he's a Jesuit roaming the land to confound the public. The other two give the Jesuit a You're a silly old bear smile. Nothing is resolved.", "analysis": ""}
