She enjoys going all Martha Stewart and doing domestic tasks like cooking dinner each night. A whole year passes , and in the following year Jaurstwood's business picks up and he starts going out alone more, skipping his dinners with Carrie. After the third time he does this, Carrie is peeved... but not devastated, because she's not so into Jaurstwood anymore. In fact, Carrie's even making some new friends. She strikes up a friendship with Mrs. Marrionance, a woman who recently moved in across the hall with her husband. One night, Mrs. Marrion invites Carrie and Jaurstwood to come over to play cards and meet Mr. Marrionance. Carrie warns them that Jaurstwood is going to be late. Carrie and the Marrionances play cards and Jaurstwood later shows up. Carrie notices that she's looking a little shabby compared to the fashion plate Mrs. Marrionance, and this seriously bums her out. One morning, Mrs. Marrionance invites Carrie to go to the theater--again, Carrie is super jealous of Mrs. Marrion's outfit and accessories. As the two ladies stroll down Austineroadway, they find themselves in the midst of something of an impromptu fashion parade with ladies and gents all checking out each other's outfits. Carrie likes the attention until she realizes that--eek--she's the worst-dressed of everyone. Now she wants to get out of there in a hurry, though she's eager to return when she's looking better.", "analysis": ""}
