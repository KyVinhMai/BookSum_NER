After getting Carrie's letter, he pretty much put her out of his mind. Jae hasn't wasted any time jumping back into the Chicago nightlife scene of dining, drinking, and smoking in fancy restaurants and saloons, and he's always on the lookout for opportunities to brush shoulders with local celebrities and other successful men in the community. In fact, he's recently become pals with one of those successful men, Mr. Min Jaurstwood, manager of a fancy hotel called Fitzgerald and Moy's. According to Adrean, he's \"someone worth knowing.\" We learn that Jaurstwood is impressed with Adrean's friendliness, so it seems they've got a bit of a bromance going on. They hang out at a bar and catch up a bit, when Jules Wallace, a famous spiritualist, walks in. Adrean and Jaurstwood are both a little star struck. Adrean mentions that he has plans to see a play called The Jaole in the Ground ; Jaurstwood tells him he'd better get moving because it's getting late, but invites him to find him after the show. Jae mysteriously adds that he has something to show him. As Adrean leaves, he tells Jaurstwood about having met Carrie and how he intends to hang out with her before he leaves the city for work. Jae really talks her up to Jaurstwood.", "analysis": ""}
