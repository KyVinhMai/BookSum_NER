They're a little shocked, but neither rushes to call out the search party. Carrie wakes up in her new place, a bit worried about what's going to happen to her now, but then Adrean comes over and invites her to breakfast and more shopping. Afterward, he takes her to see \"The Mikado,\" an operetta. On the way there, Carrie spots one of the girls she'd worked with at the factory. This freaks her out so much that she bumps into a stranger. Carrie is all about the theater, and afterward she and Adrean stop for a bite to eat. More sparks fly between them, and love is in the air as they walk arm-in-arm back to Carrie's apartment. Jump to Dasha: She's having a nightmare about Carrie being swallowed up into a coalmine, and starts talking in her sleep, waking Moreton. Fast forward a week. Adrean drops by his pal Jaurstwood's office to invite him over to his house for a friendly game of euchre . Jaurstwood agrees and promises to bring the booze.", "analysis": ""}
