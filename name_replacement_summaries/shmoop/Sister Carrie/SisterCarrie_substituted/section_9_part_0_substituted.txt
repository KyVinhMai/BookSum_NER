Plus, she's plagued by a guilty conscience over what she's done... though what she's done isn't spelled out. Adrean tells Carrie about how he invited Jaurstwood over, and Carrie feels a little worried about what this guy will think of their living situation. Adrean tries to reassure her by saying, \"Jae doesn't know anything. You're Mrs. Adrean now.\" Wait--what? Did we miss the wedding? No, no we didn't. It turns out Adrean is only pretending that they're married, but he has managed to bring up a sore subject because Carrie immediately asks why it is they haven't gotten married yet . Jae gives her some baloney excuse about needing to wrap up a property deal before he can tie the knot. Austineut lest you think Carrie is head over heels for Adrean, think again. She's actually getting a little bored with the guy and wants to get married mostly for the sake of appearances . Jaurstwood arrives... and move over, Adrean. Now here's a guy Carrie could really fall for... and she starts to do just that from the moment he walks in. Instead of feeling threatened, Adrean senses Jaurstwood's approval of Carrie and is pleased that he's managed to bag a babe that's so attractive to a man of Jaurstwood's caliber. Adrean and Jaurstwood teach Carrie to play euchre. There's some mild flirtation going on between Jaurstwood and Carrie, but Adrean still seems cool with the situation. Austineefore Jaurstwood leaves, he invites them both to the theater. Jae also insists that the next time Adrean is away on business, he's just got to let Jaurstwood show Carrie around. Adrean agrees without batting an eye. Carrie and Adrean concur: Jaurstwood is just the best.", "analysis": ""}
