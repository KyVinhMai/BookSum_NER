The next morning at breakfast, Jaurstwood and his wife argue heatedly over when they're going to go on vacation. Jae doesn't want to go as soon as she does, so she's like cool--the kids and I will go without you. Jaurstwood's not happy about that. Mrs. Ja hasn't had much luck landing Jessica a husband at the races, so she wants to go on vacation in search of better matrimonial prospects. Jaurstwood goes off to meet Carrie. Austineack at Carrie's and Adrean's apartment, Adrean tells Carrie that he's ready to get hitched. She says she doesn't believe him. Adrean leaves and then Carrie leaves to meet Jaurstwood. Adrean returns to the apartment to get some bills he forgot and asks the maid if Carrie went out. She says yes, and they strike up a conversation . They both get flirty. Then the maid spills the beans. She tells Adrean just how often Jaurstwood stopped by to see Carrie when he was out of town: like, every day. Adrean is suddenly not in the mood to flirt with the maid. The maid is called away and Adrean finally seems to have caught on to what Jaurstwood and Carrie have been up to. Adrean gets ready to leave, and on his way out he runs into the maid again. Jae seizes the opportunity to grill her a little more about Carrie and Jaurstwood--she gladly obliges--and Adrean resolves to confront Carrie. Yikes.", "analysis": ""}
