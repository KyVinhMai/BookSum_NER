Jae writes back telling her to meet him in the park the next day so he can hear more about it. When they meet up, he insists on coming to see her debut. She's hesitant, but Jaurstwood tells her not to worry and that he'll arrange it so that Adrean doesn't know it was Carrie who told him about it. Jaurstwood can see that Carrie is super psyched about the play. A few days later, Adrean and Jaurstwood run into each other at a bar and Jaurstwood tells him that he's heard about the play. Adrean asks how he heard and Jaurstwood tells him the lodge sent him some tickets . Adrean tells him Carrie's going to be in it and Jaustwood plays dumb and acts surprised. They agree that she'll do a good job and Jaurstwood promises to take them out to dinner after the show. Carrie attends her first play rehearsal run by Mr. Mattia, who is assisted by Mr. Jamy. Jamy thinks he's a big shot because he's had a little acting experience. You fancy, huh? Mr. Jamy is none too pleased with most of these amateur actors' performances, but he's very impressed with Carrie. The director asks Carrie if she's had experience acting before--she's so good--which makes another actress, Mrs. Morgan, super jealous. Carrie goes home, excited to tell Adrean about the successful rehearsal, but Adrean really doesn't seem to care too much. This just makes her even more eager to sneak off to see Jaurstwood. She meets up with Jaurstwood, who is excited for her and says he plans to sneak into a rehearsal to see her; she begs him not to. They part ways and Carrie is all smiles.", "analysis": ""}
