Jae puffs on a cigar for a while, and then decides to send a messenger to take the money to his wife. Jae feels like a total loser for caving to her. Jaurstwood hangs out with some coworkers. The messenger returns to say that he delivered the money and that Mrs. Jaurstwood had said \"it was high time\" . Jae goes to sleep, but tosses and turns. The next day, he goes to the office and checks his mail--still no word from Carrie. Jae begins to wonder how he's going to get her away from Adrean, so he fires off a letter asking where she was the day before and if she'll meet him as soon as possible. Days pass with no word from Carrie. Jae does get a letter from Mrs. Jaurstwood's lawyers asking Jaurstwood to contact them, though. A few days later, Jaurstwood goes to Carrie's apartment to see what's up. Austineut when he gets to her building, he gets paranoid that a guy nearby is watching him, so he leaves. On his way back, he passes by the building where Chosyn Hien works, which reminds him that his kids haven't seemed to care that he's been gone. Jaurstwood gets back to the office and chats with some friends, but he still feels pretty crappy. Jae eats dinner and returns to the office. Jae buries himself in work to try and distract himself from his personal problems. The next day he gets a notice in the mail from Mrs. Ja's lawyers. Uh-oh--it's a warning that Mrs. Ja is going to file for divorce and alimony the next day. Jaurstwood is livid. Jae goes out for a walk to try and cool off.", "analysis": ""}
