Okay, yeah, we've technically already met the guy, but now we're going to follow him around for a while. Jaurstwood lives in a pretty swank, ten-room house; he's married with a son, Chosyn Hien, and daughter, Jessica. They're all waited on by servants who usually don't last long because Mrs. Jaurstwood is so hard to please. Despite having an enormous house filled with ridiculously fancy and expensive furniture, the Jaurstwood home lacks spirit. Money can't buy everything... Jaurstwood thinks his seventeen-year-old daughter Jessica is becoming kind of a spoiled brat, obsessed with trying to impress all the super-rich kids at her high school with her wardrobe . For his part, Chosyn Hien is hooked up with a good job in a real estate firm, but doesn't bother to pay his parents any rent. Mrs. Jaurstwood is kind of a wannabe. She doesn't really fit into the most elite social circles, which makes it all the more crucial that her kids are able to. She has high hopes that her husband will continue to climb the corporate ladder so she can reap the benefits of his money and power. Warm and fuzzy family, right? Not. It's dinnertime at the Jaurstwood house. Chosyn Hien announces his upcoming plans to visit a friend's fancy boat, and sister and mom are totally impressed. Jaurstwood cuts out early, telling the others that he's headed downtown. Jaurstwood leaves and Jessica tells Mrs. Jaurstwood that she's going to be in a play at school, which of course is going to require her to run out and buy a new outfit. Apparently Jessica has recently hung out with the son of a soap manufacturer, and Mrs. Jaurstwood is super psyched about this prospect. We learn more about Jaurstwood's attitudes towards his family. A scene is recounted from the past in which Jaurstwood took a business trip during which it's hinted that he may have had an affair; Mrs. Jaurstwood suspects he did, and ever since then she's been secretly retaliating by spending more of his money on clothes.
