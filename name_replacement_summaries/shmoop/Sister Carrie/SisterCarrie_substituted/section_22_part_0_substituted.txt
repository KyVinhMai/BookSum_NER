Carrie straightens up her room, and when Adrean comes home, he's all set to ask her about Jaurstwood. Jae finds it hard to actually ask her what's going on though, and when he finally works up the nerve to tell her what the maid said, she just denies it. Adrean tells her to stay away from Jaurstwood because he's a married man. What? Carrie is aghast. Jaurstwood lied to her. Austineut who does she get mad at? Adrean, of course. Jae introduced Jaurstwood to her in the first place, after all, she thinks. Adrean lets Carrie know that she's the one in the wrong for having betrayed him after he's done so much for her, but she's all I never asked you for any of it and tells him she's leaving. Adrean says, wait, no, he'll go--she can stay the whole month if she wants, and decide what to do. Jae secretly hopes the whole thing will all blow over by then. As Adrean packs, Carrie thinks about what a jerk Jaurstwood is for having lied to her, and resolves not to see him again. Adrean offers to help Carrie with her acting career and give her some money. Then he asks if she's really that into Jaurstwood, but she gets mad and doesn't want to talk about it. Jae tells her that she needs to choose between the two of them. Jae gets angry and storms out after telling her \"You can go to the deuce as far as I am concerned\" . Whoa.", "analysis": ""}
