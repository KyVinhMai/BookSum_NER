They chat about how great her performance in the play was, then things turn serious and he begs her to go away with him. Carrie's not sure. She's still wondering whether Jaurstwood knows that she and Adrean aren't really married, and she wonders if Jaurstwood wants to marry her. Jae continues to beg, pleading with her to come with him tonight or Saturday at the latest. She asks if they can get married Saturday and he says yes, so she agrees. They're both thrilled--never mind the minor issue of Carrie's live-in lover or the fact that old Jaurstwood is already married. They're in love. They agree to meet the next day to further discuss their plans.", "analysis": ""}
