Despite his financial woes though, he and Carrie find a nice apartment with a sweet view of Central Park. Carrie complains about how small it is compared to where she lived in Chicago, but so it goes in NYC. Jaurstwood sets about looking for business opportunities. Jae ends up finding work managing a local saloon . At first he's pretty stoked about having gotten his new career going, however things sour pretty quickly. Jais alcoholic business partner is cranky and Jaurstwood doesn't really care for the saloon's sub-par clientele. Plus, the business doesn't pay as much as he expected. About a month after getting the job, Carrie announces she's going to buy a dress. Jae asks her if she can wait because money is a little tight. She agrees to hold off, but thinks it's a little weird since he never had money troubles before. She starts to notice other signs of financial problems and grows uneasy. On top of his money troubles, Jaurstwood lives in fear of running into someone he knew from his old life. Jae recalls a time in which he ran into someone on the street who promised to stop into his saloon but then never did. Jae also sees trouble on the horizon in his marriage so long as money problems persist.", "analysis": ""}
