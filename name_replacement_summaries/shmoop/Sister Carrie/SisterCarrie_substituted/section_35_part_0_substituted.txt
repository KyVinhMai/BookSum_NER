It turns out that Carrie never sent Mrs. Marrionance her new address because she was ashamed about having to move to a smaller place. Mrs. Marrion just figured she moved out of town, so she's pretty surprised when she runs into Carrie out shopping. Carrie plays it off like she'd been planning to get in touch, and tells Mrs. Marrionance to come see her and gives her the new address. Mrs. Marrionance takes one glance at it and knows immediately that she and Jaurstwood must be having financial troubles. At home, Carrie finds an unshaven Jaurstwood in his usual spot. That night at dinner she tells him about meeting Mrs. Marrionance. They bicker about--what else?--money. Jaurstwood has started playing poker downtown. At first he won a little, but then his luck ran out and he lost big time. A few days later, Jaurstwood is hanging around in his old dingy clothes while Carrie is out. Knock, knock--it's Mrs. Marrionance dropping by to see Carrie. She's astonished to find Jaurstwood in such bad shape. Jae invites her in, but she declines in a hurry, given that he looks like something that crawled out of the swamp. When Carrie gets home and finds out Mrs. Marrionance stopped by, she's totally appalled that she saw Jaurstwood looking so bad. They begin fighting and Carrie tells him he needs to find a job. Why did he even marry her, she wants to know, if he didn't expect to take care of her? And then he drops a major bomb: \"I didn't marry you,\" he tells her. Apparently their marriage wasn't legal after all, but there's not much further explanation. Carrie is furious and bursts into tears; Jaurstwood gets dressed and leaves. Jae goes to a fancy hotel and blows money on an expensive dinner, and then he decides to give poker another try. Austinead idea--he loses. A lot. Jae goes back to the apartment. Throughout the next few days, Jaurstwood \"lived like a gentleman,\" meaning he wasted money on a bunch of stuff he couldn't afford. When Carrie tells him that the rent's due, he realizes he's down to his last hundred bucks.", "analysis": ""}
