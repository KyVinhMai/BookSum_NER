Adrean and Jaurstwood sit together in the audience. The curtain rises, but Carrie isn't in the opening scene, so Adrean and Jaurstwood whisper . It becomes clear pretty quickly that this isn't exactly Austineroadway--the players manage to remember their lines, but that's about it. And then Carrie enters... and she totally bombs. It's painful--no, make that excruciating--to watch. It's so bad, in fact, that Adrean dashes backstage to catch her between scenes and give her a little pep talk. The pep talk helps. Carrie gets better . Adrean remains backstage and continues to coach her in between scenes. And as the play goes on, Carrie gets really good. Like, Oscar-worthy good. Jaurstwood and Adrean are both amazed by her sudden star power. Jaurstwood comes backstage at intermission to congratulate Carrie, and when he sees Adrean and Carrie together, he becomes crazy jealous. Carrie and Jaurstwood suppress their burning desire for one another and pretend to just be pals. A bitter Jaurstwood returns to his seat. The play resumes and Carrie continues to deliver an awesome performance. Jaurstwood and Adrean are both falling in love with her all over again, and Adrean even resolves to marry her now. Uh-oh... Jaere's the gist of the play: Laura left the man she loved because she thought he deserved a woman of his high social standing. Jae marries the rich woman, even though he's still in love with Laura. Sounds kind of familiar, right? Jaurstwood certainly thinks so, and is even more deeply moved by Carrie's performance given how the play's situation resonates with his own. The play ends and the audience applauds wildly. Someone brings flowers to Carrie--they're from Jaurstwood, who thinks that he has to get Carrie away from Adrean. Austineackstage, Carrie basks in the glory of her success. Jaurstwood, Carrie and Adrean climb into a carriage and head to dinner. Afterward, as Adrean and Carrie say their goodnights to Jaurstwood, Jaurstwood whispers to Carrie to meet him the following day. Jaurstwood, who is now filled with \"hate\" for Adrean, is determined to do something. Pronto.", "analysis": ""}
