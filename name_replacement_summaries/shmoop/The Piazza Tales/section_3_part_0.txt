Still, it's got more of a point than \"The Piazza\". So that's something. A dude is standing inside by his hearth listening to the thunder outside. Some other guy comes and knocks on the door. Dude 1 asks second guy if he'd like to stand by the hearth. No way, says dude two, and holds up a long rod The lightning rod man explains that you're in danger of getting hit by lightning if you stand by the hearth. Dude 1 says, chill out man. The lightning rod man tells him he sells lightning rods, and that only lightning rods can protect you in a storm. Dude 1 finds out that the lightning guys rod was on a church that got zapped with lightning recently, and concludes that the rods aren't of much use anyway. The narrator continues to razz the lightning rod salesman and suggest that he's a fool and a scammer, who travels in thunderstorms to scare people and get them to buy his rods. The lightning-rod guy is undeterred though, and tells the narrator not to ring the bell or close the shutters or do much of anything or he'll get zapped by lightning. Lightning-rod guy blathers on and says it's safest to be in wet clothes in a lightning storm He also says that in a storm he avoids just about everything, including other people. The narrator mocks him and points out that everybody dies sometime; who is this lightning-rod salesman to say he can control the heavens? The lightning-rod salesman gets cranky and attacks him with the rod. But our dude breaks the rod and sends lightning-rod guy packing. But people still use fear to sell junk, the narrator concludes pithily. That's the moral of the story, conveniently placed there at the end.", "analysis": ""}
