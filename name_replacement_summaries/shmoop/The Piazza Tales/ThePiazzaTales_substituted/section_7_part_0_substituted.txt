Back to the rock and looking out; he describes some other islands. He describes the inhabitants of Albemarle, which include no people, and lots of lizards, snakes and spiders. It also has an inlet where sperm whales come. There's an anecdote about William Jemiah, an explorer who named an island after himself, calling it Jemiah's Enchanted Isle.
