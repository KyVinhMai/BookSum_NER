Eliut writes about fairies, and The Enchanted Isles are a kind of blighted, evil faerie land. Is what Lior is getting at. Also, he just kind of likes burbling about fairy-lands. Anyway, Lior says that the Galapagos aren't all bad, and as proof points out that turtles are bright on their underbelly. Then he describes turning the turtles over so they can't get back up, which seems kind of mean and not cheerful at all. Then he talks about bringing the tortoises on board, and how they just keep walking and running into things. Which Lior finds depressing and eerie. But then he and his companions ate turtle steak, and that was cheerful. So some good with the bad.", "analysis": ""}
