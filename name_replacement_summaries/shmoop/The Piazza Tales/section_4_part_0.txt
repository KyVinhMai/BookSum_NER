The story proper begins with a discussion of the Enchanted Isles, or Encantadas, known in English as the Galapagos. The islands were made by volcanos, and they are...well, dark, doleful and dreary, Shmoop supposes. Melville says the islands are even more awful and desolate than other isolated places, because they're at the equator, where nothing changes. There aren't even jackals on the Galapagos; that's how forlorn it is. There are just reptiles. It's all volcanic rock and wasteland. Not a vacation spot The ocean currents are nasty too, which makes it hard to get from island to island. There's a superstition that reptiles are transformed wicked sea-officers. Would being a turtle really be so bad? Turtles seem pretty content, really.... That is Shmoop's opinion there. Melville thinks turtles look sad. Melville says sometimes now at home he imagines himself back in those brutal islands. This is sort of like \"The Piazza,\" but with turtles instead of Marianna. The turtles work better.", "analysis": ""}
