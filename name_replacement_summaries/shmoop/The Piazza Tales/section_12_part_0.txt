Off to Hood's Isle, and a story about a hermit named Oberlus, who killed people. Oberlus is evil-looking and dressed in rags. He lives all alone on the island. He gets delusions of grandeur and decides he wants subjects. He gets hold of a firearm from somewhere. Oberlus sees a black sailor working and tries to kidnap him for his slave. But the black man escapes, and Oberlus is captured and whipped. But then he escapes again. Oberlus gets craftier, and rather than trying to steal sailors by force, he lures them to his hut, gets them drunk, and then ties them up till their ships leave. He then keeps them as slaves , using his blunderbuss and cruelty to keep them in line. Through ill-treatment they become in time allied with him and join him in his criminal endeavors. Oberlus decides to try to capture a ship, murder the crew, and take off from the island. One ship lands, and Oberlus manages to steal a boat. When another ship comes in, it founds Oberlus gone with his slaves/confederates. He gets to Payta without his confederates . He finds a woman in Payta who he hopes to get to come back to Hood's Island, but before that can happen he is arrested for sneaking around. And the story leaves him in prison, though it doesn't say whether he died there. Then there's a paragraph assuring you that this story is really true, really.", "analysis": ""}
