Tom Morgan says he's not feeling well; he's still thinking about Captain Flint. They start talking about the pirate captain again. Suddenly a high voice somewhere in the trees starts singing, \"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest/ Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum!\" . The six pirates truly freak out - Tom Morgan actually falls to the ground. Long John Silver is pale and frightened, but he tells the other pirates it's just someone messing around. Then the voice calls, \"Fetch aft the rum, Darby!\" . Apparently, these were Flint's last words. Long John Silver won't let the other terrified pirates turn back. He points out that the call had an echo - and no spirit voice echoes, does it? George Merry seems comforted by Long John Silver's observation. They realize that the voice doesn't sound like Captain Flint at all - it sounds like Ben Gunn! George Merry says no one cares about the ghost of Ben Gunn. So all the pirates seem to feel much better, and they continue on. Dick Johnson is still holding his Bible fearfully, and Long John Silver makes fun of him for it. Finally they reach the three tall pines where the treasure is buried. Thinking he's about to find a vast treasure, Long John Silver looks menacingly at Jim. Jim realizes that if the pirates find the treasure, Long John Silver may not honor the treaty he struck with Doctor Livesey. Dick Johnson has started babbling - he's caught a bad fever and he's becoming incoherent. Then they find something that's a complete shock: the treasure has already been dug up!", "analysis": ""}
