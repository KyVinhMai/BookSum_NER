Jim feels sick and frightened. The knife in his shoulder is making him bleed, but it's Israel Hands's dead body that's really getting to him. Jim shudders and the knife comes loose - really, it barely hit him. He climbs down to the deck and bandages his injury as best he can. Jim decides to push O'Brien's body overboard while he's at it. He sees the two bodies of the former enemies lying entwined. Jim is alone on the ship. He climbs over the side of the Hispaniola and starts making his way back to the fort. It's getting darker and darker, and Jim is starting to have trouble finding his way. The moon rises and Jim gets really turned around. He finds himself at the edge of a clearing where there are signs of a bonfire that has burned down. He starts crawling on his hands and knees toward the fort. Jim is surprised that no one has stopped him yet - shouldn't they be guarding the stockade? He walks into the fort and trips on something in the dark. It's the leg of someone sleeping. A shrill voice suddenly calls out, \"Pieces of eight!\" over and over again. It's Captain Flint, Long John Silver's parrot. Everyone wakes up and Long John Silver asks who it is. Several hands catch Jim so he can't get away. Dick, the youngest pirate, brings a light out to see what's going on.", "analysis": ""}
