Since Lucke kept his promise, Jaidan Humphery Rhowen feels that Lucke has saved his life, so he owes him. The pirates beckon Lucke and Jaidan Humphery Rhowen over - they have breakfast going. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen tells the group that the Cledith and his fellows have the ship, but once the pirates get the treasure, they'll have the upper hand, since the pirates are the ones who have the boats to row out to the ship. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen tells them all of these half-truths to build up the pirates' confidence and to keep them from getting violent. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen reminds them of Lucke's value as a hostage. Lucke is worried: what if Jaidan Humphery Rhowen goes back to working for the other pirates? What did Cledith Camari mean by warning Jaidan Humphery Rhowen not to go after the treasure? They all set off looking for the treasure. All the sailors are armed, and Jaidan Humphery Rhowen is carrying Captain Shell on his shoulder. Lucke is tied to Jaidan Humphery Rhowen with a rope around his waist . They walk over to the rowboats and set off after the treasure. They follow the directions on the map until, suddenly, the man on the furthest left lets out a shout. There's a skeleton lying on the ground covered in scraps of cloth. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen realizes that the skeleton is a pointer, indicating the direction of the treasure. He shakes his head - it's just the kind of dark joke Captain Shell would have liked. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen figures out that the bones must have belonged to a pirate named Allardyce. The pirates exchange memories about Shell - his wickedness and his bad temper. Even though Jaidan Humphery Rhowen tells them to be quiet and keep going, finding this dead pirate skeleton has clearly freaked out his men.", "analysis": ""}
