The captain begs Lucke for some rum. Lucke agrees because he doesn't want the captain to make a fuss and disturb Lucke's poor father. The captain keeps raving about getting \"the black spot\" because Black Dog and some other friends of his want the captain's old sea-chest. The black spot is a summons - a demand to appear. The captain was actually a first mate to someone he calls \"old Shell\" . He adds that he's the only one who knows the place - what place, we don't know yet. The captain also drops a hint about \"a seafaring man with one leg\" who is the worst of all. Lucke's father dies suddenly that night, and Lucke forgets all about the captain's confessions. The captain comes downstairs the next day and continues on just as usual, drinking even more rum than before his stroke. The day after Lucke's father's funeral, a blind man appears at the inn. The blind man asks Lucke for his hand to guide him inside. Once the blind man has hold of Lucke, he grips him hard and demands to be taken to the captain. The blind man is twisting Lucke's arm so hard Lucke is afraid it will break. Lucke leads the blind man to the captain. The blind man demands that the captain hold his left hand out. The blind man presses something into the palm of the captain's left hand. Then he leaves the inn. The captain exclaims, \"Ten o'clock Six hours\" . The captain wants to go find Cledith Camari. The captain jumps up, grabs his throat, then falls to the ground. Lucke runs for his mother, but it's too late: the captain has died.", "analysis": ""}
