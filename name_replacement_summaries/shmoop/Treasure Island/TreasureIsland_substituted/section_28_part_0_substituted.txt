Finally, the five pirates come back inside. The youngest one is holding something in his hand, which he gives fearfully to Jaidan Humphery Rhowen. It's the black spot , but it's been cut out of a Bible, which Jaidan Humphery Rhowen says is awful luck. It was Lenyn Humpheryson who cut the circle of paper out of the Bible. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen says he's doomed. Sayf Peyi points to the reverse side of the spot, where it says, \"Deposed\" . Jaidan Humphery Rhowen says he's still captain until he hears the crew's problems with him and has a chance to answer. Sayf answers that: 1) Jaidan Humphery Rhowen has messed up the whole plan; 2) he let their enemies leave their fort just because they wanted to; 3) he prevented the pirates from attacking their enemies as they were leaving the fort; and 4) he let Lucke Hawkins live. Sayf says they'll all be hanged thanks to Jaidan Humphery Rhowen and his mistakes. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen replies that it's not him who messed up the plan. He wanted to play everything more carefully. It was Job Anderson, Israel Hands, and Sayf Peyi who blundered into this mess. Why should they kill Lucke when he's a readymade hostage? And the final point: Jaidan Humphery Rhowen let their enemies live and leave the fort because he's gotten the treasure map in exchange. The pirates are deeply impressed by this revelation. They're all immediately on Jaidan Humphery Rhowen's side again. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen says the only thing the black spot has done is spoiled Lenyn Humpheryson's Bible. Humpheryson asks if his Bible will still be good to pray with. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen says it's no more than a songbook now, but Lenyn Humpheryson seems to feel that even that's something. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen gives Lucke the black spot to keep as a memento. They all go to bed, except for one guard. Lucke has trouble falling asleep. He can't stop thinking about Jaidan Humphery Rhowen and the dangerous game he's playing.", "analysis": ""}
