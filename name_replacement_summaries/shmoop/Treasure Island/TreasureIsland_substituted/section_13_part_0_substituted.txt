He comes across a glade of trees. He hears a rustle from a surprised bird and assumes that his shipmates are about to appear. He hides in a tree and listens. Two people are talking: Jaidan Humphery Rhowen and a sailor named Nizam. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen is explaining something to Nizam - it's unclear what. Nizam answers: Rhowen, you're a brave, smart, rich guy - why would you follow the words of this bunch of low-lives? Nizam's answer is interrupted by a scream off in the distance. Nizam jumps and reaches out his hand to Jaidan Humphery Rhowen. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen leaps backwards out of reach and demands that Nizam keep his hands off. Nizam tells Jaidan Humphery Rhowen he must be feeling guilty about something, to be so afraid of Nizam. Nizam asks what that sound was. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen doesn't sound upset at all when he says it must have been Alan. Nizam says Alan was a true sailor and tells Jaidan Humphery Rhowen he won't join Rhowen's group even if it means his death. Nizam turns around and sets off for the beach. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen grabs a branch and hits Nizam across the back, then stabs him twice. Lucke faints. When Lucke comes to, he sees Jaidan Humphery Rhowen pull a whistle out of his pocket and blow a series of notes as some kind of signal. Lucke grows frightened and crawls away. Lucke is lost and too afraid to go back to the ship. He thinks he's either going to starve to death on the island or be murdered by the mutineers. Lucke has reached a hillier, more thickly forested part of the island. Something makes him stand stock still, his heart beating quickly.", "analysis": ""}
