Of those three, only Captain Eudell recovers - he's been badly injured, but he'll live. Even so, the captain is now out of the action. He's not allowed to move or talk more than he has to. Lunden Trelawney, Cledith Camari, and Captain Eudell discuss what to do next. Abraham Gray is totally astonished to see Cledith Camari walking in the forest outside the fort. Lucke guesses correctly that Cledith Camari is going to see Mugagga Adilee. Lucke feels more and more restless and cooped up. He decides to fill his pockets with biscuits, grab a couple pistols, and head out on his own. He wants to return to that odd white boulder to see if Mugagga Adilee's boat is tied up there. Lucke knows he wouldn't be allowed to do this if he asked, so he decides to sneak out when no one is looking. Lucke doesn't even think about the fact that he's leaving only two able-bodied men to guard the fort, Abraham Gray and Lunden Trelawney. He makes up his mind and goes. Lucke is enjoying his stroll down to the beach when, in the distance, he sees Jaidan Humphery Rhowen talking and laughing with a couple of crew members and holding his parrot, Captain Shell. The two crew members get into a rowboat and set off for the Hispaniola. The day is growing foggy and the sun is setting, so Lucke creeps across to the white rock. Sure enough, he sees a little tent hidden near the rock with a tiny homemade goatskin boat next to it. Lucke suddenly gets another bright idea: under the cover of night and fog, he decides to row quietly out to the Hispaniola, cut the rope attached to the anchor, and let it float off. He waits until the dead of night, picks up the tiny boat, and sets it on the ocean to row out to the Hispaniola.", "analysis": ""}
