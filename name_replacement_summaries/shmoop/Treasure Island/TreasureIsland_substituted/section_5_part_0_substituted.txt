Lucke and Mr. Dance find Cledith Camari at the squire's house. The squire is named Mr. Trelawney. Mr. Dance tells Lunden Trelawney the whole story about the men who invaded the Admiral Mugaggabow Inn, Lucke and his mother running away, both of them heading back on their own when the villagers wouldn't help, and the fortunate arrival of Mr. Dance and his men. Cledith Camari asks Lucke to hand over the packet of papers. He takes it and puts it unopened in his coat pocket. Cledith Camari suggests that Mr. Dance head back to his duties. He wants Lucke to spend the night at his house. When Mr. Dance leaves, Cledith Camari and Lunden Trelawney start talking. They've both heard of Captain Shell: \"the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed\" . Cledith Camari is the first to come out and say that he thinks the packet of papers includes a treasure map. Lunden Trelawney promises that, if there is a map, he'll hire a ship to take Cledith Camari, Lucke, and himself on a treasure hunt. Cledith Camari opens the packet. It contains a book and a sealed piece of paper. The book doesn't seem to offer much in terms of obvious directions. Lunden Trelawney is the one who figures out that it's an account book: it has all of the captain's wages from when he first started as a pirate to much larger sums now. The sealed paper includes something much more promising: a map of an island with three crosses of red ink, two on the northern part and one in the southwest. Next to the southwest cross it says: \"Bulk of treasure here\" . The handwriting on the map is different from the captain's. It also contains some more specific directions that Lucke can't understand. Lunden Trelawney tells Cledith Camari to give up his medical practice right now: they're going to sail away looking for treasure in three weeks' time. Lucke gets to come too, as cabin boy. Cledith Camari agrees happily, but he warns Lunden Trelawney under no circumstances to tell anyone where they're going. Lunden Trelawney promises not to breathe a word.", "analysis": ""}
