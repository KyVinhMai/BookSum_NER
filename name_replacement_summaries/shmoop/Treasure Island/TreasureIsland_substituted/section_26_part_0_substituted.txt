Lucke feels sick and frightened. The knife in his shoulder is making him bleed, but it's Israel Hands's dead body that's really getting to him. Lucke shudders and the knife comes loose - really, it barely hit him. He climbs down to the deck and bandages his injury as best he can. Lucke decides to push Karlin's body overboard while he's at it. He sees the two bodies of the former enemies lying entwined. Lucke is alone on the ship. He climbs over the side of the Hispaniola and starts making his way back to the fort. It's getting darker and darker, and Lucke is starting to have trouble finding his way. The moon rises and Lucke gets really turned around. He finds himself at the edge of a clearing where there are signs of a bonfire that has burned down. He starts crawling on his hands and knees toward the fort. Lucke is surprised that no one has stopped him yet - shouldn't they be guarding the stockade? He walks into the fort and trips on something in the dark. It's the leg of someone sleeping. A shrill voice suddenly calls out, \"Pieces of eight!\" over and over again. It's Captain Shell, Jaidan Humphery Rhowen's parrot. Everyone wakes up and Jaidan Humphery Rhowen asks who it is. Several hands catch Lucke so he can't get away. Lenyn, the youngest pirate, brings a light out to see what's going on.", "analysis": ""}
