Nizam Morgan says he's not feeling well; he's still thinking about Captain Shell. They start talking about the pirate captain again. Suddenly a high voice somewhere in the trees starts singing, \"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest/ Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum!\" . The six pirates truly freak out - Nizam Morgan actually falls to the ground. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen is pale and frightened, but he tells the other pirates it's just someone messing around. Then the voice calls, \"Fetch aft the rum, Darby!\" . Apparently, these were Shell's last words. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen won't let the other terrified pirates turn back. He points out that the call had an echo - and no spirit voice echoes, does it? Sayf Peyi seems comforted by Jaidan Humphery Rhowen's observation. They realize that the voice doesn't sound like Captain Shell at all - it sounds like Mugagga Adilee! Sayf Peyi says no one cares about the ghost of Mugagga Adilee. So all the pirates seem to feel much better, and they continue on. Lenyn Humpheryson is still holding his Bible fearfully, and Jaidan Humphery Rhowen makes fun of him for it. Finally they reach the three tall pines where the treasure is buried. Thinking he's about to find a vast treasure, Jaidan Humphery Rhowen looks menacingly at Lucke. Lucke realizes that if the pirates find the treasure, Jaidan Humphery Rhowen may not honor the treaty he struck with Cledith Camari. Lenyn Humpheryson has started babbling - he's caught a bad fever and he's becoming incoherent. Then they find something that's a complete shock: the treasure has already been dug up!", "analysis": ""}
