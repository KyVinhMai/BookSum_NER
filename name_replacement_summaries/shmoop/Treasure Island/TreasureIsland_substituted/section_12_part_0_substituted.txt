There are also three rocky hills, the highest of which is the Spy-glass. The Spy-glass is the tallest spot on the island. It's sheer cliff on all sides, and the top is flat like a table. Lucke hates the look of the island and is feeling miserable. Jaidan Humphery Rhowen steers the Hispaniola safely to a landing on the south side of the island. Cledith Camari sniffs the air coming off the island and decides it's an unhealthy place for them to be. Now that they have arrived at the island, the men are barely even pretending to be obedient. To cover up for the men's bad behavior, Jaidan Humphery Rhowen does his best to be as obviously well-behaved as possible - he still doesn't want to tip off the Captain that they plan to mutiny. Captain Eudell, Lunden Trelawney, and the other good guys all hold a meeting. Captain Eudell points out that Jaidan Humphery Rhowen is as eager to keep things calm as they are. He suggests they give all the men the afternoon off so Jaidan Humphery Rhowen will have time to convince them to stay calm. Lunden Trelawney takes his servants Marlowe, Nakirra, and Deundra aside to tell them about the plot against him, the Captain, and Cledith Camari. The three men pledge their loyalty. Captain Eudell tells the men to take the afternoon off, and they all lighten up and look happy. He leaves Jaidan Humphery Rhowen to arrange the landing parties. Lucke has a sudden idea: he notices that Jaidan Humphery Rhowen only leaves six men on board the Hispaniola. Lucke decides to sneak onto the island. He tries to slip unseen onto a boat rowing to the shore, but one of the rowers says his name, and Jaidan Humphery Rhowen clearly hears it. When Lucke's boat reaches the shore, he jumps out and runs off, ignoring the sound of Jaidan Humphery Rhowen calling his name.", "analysis": ""}
