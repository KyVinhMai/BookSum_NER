One January morning, the captain is sitting at the beach with his telescope on his arm. Lucke is setting the breakfast table when a pale man missing two fingers on his left hand comes in. The man sits down, orders a rum, and asks Lucke about a friend of his named Domanique, who has a cut on his right cheek. Lucke answers that they know a man like that, whom they call the captain. The man asks where the captain is and Lucke says he'll be coming back to the inn soon. The man physically pushes Lucke into another room and makes him hide behind a door. The man half draws his sword and stands waiting in silence for the captain. The captain walks in at last, strolling straight for the breakfast table. The man calls out, \"Domanique,\" and the captain whirls around, paling. The captain gasps out the man's name: \"Black Dog!\" Black Dog invites the captain to sit down and share some rum like proper shipmates. Lucke clears out of the room, but soon he hears a few things: the captain says if anyone's going to hang, they should all hang. Then Lucke hears the captain swearing a lot, and Black Dog comes running out with the captain hot on his heels. Their swords are both drawn, and Black Dog is bleeding. Black Dog is fast enough to run away, leaving the captain looking confused. The captain orders rum and collapses on the floor. Lucke's mother is worried that the inn is going to be disgraced by this fight. Cledith Camari has arrived at the inn to treat Lucke's father. He realizes that the captain has had a stroke. Cledith Camari bleeds the captain to try to improve his circulation. The captain wakes up and asks where Black Dog is. Cledith Camari says there's no Black Dog there, and then warns the captain that he'll die if he keeps drinking so much rum. Cledith Camari leaves after recommending that the captain stay in bed for a week.", "analysis": ""}
