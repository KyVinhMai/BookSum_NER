Mary has never met a servant like Martha--she's so friendly and so not scared by Mary's bad temper. Mary is shocked to learn that, at nine years old, Martha expects Mary to get dressed on her own. Martha helps get Mary dressed . Martha chats to Mary about her family: She's one of twelve brothers and sisters, and her family is so poor that they have trouble feeding everybody. One of her brothers, Dickon, is twelve . When Martha suggests that Mary go off and play on her own in the moors, Mary is like, um, no. It's gloomy, damp, and there's nothing to do. But then when she hears that Dickon might be out there she decides to go out after all. Martha also suggests that Mary keep her eyes open for the locked, walled garden. Apparently, it used to belong to Mr. Craven's wife, but when she died, Mr. Craven had the garden locked up. As Mary walks through the grounds and gardens of Misselthwaite Manor, she finds a wall so covered in ivy that it doesn't seem to have a door at all. As she goes looking for a door through the ivy, Mary meets an old man gardening. Even though he is not the friendliest guy in the world, Mary takes to him--it's nice to have another human being around. Mary may be a grouch, but she is still a human being who likes company. As they are talking, the gardener smiles and calls a robin over to him. Mary tells the robin that she is lonely, and the gardener seems to feel sudden sympathy for her. He introduces himself as Ben. Ben gives Mary some frank, straight talk: \"Tha' an' me are a good bit alike We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as sour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant\" . Mary wonders, for the first time ever, if she actually is nasty-tempered. Ben warns her not to go looking for the entrance to the locked garden.", "analysis": ""}
