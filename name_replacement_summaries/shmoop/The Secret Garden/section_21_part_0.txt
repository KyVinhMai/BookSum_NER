Colin meets Ben standing on his own two feet. Ben admits that there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Colin--he's certainly not at death's door. Ben seems fond of Colin when he asks what Colin's orders are. In fact, Ben has also been taking care of the Secret Garden. Sure, Mr. Craven may have ordered the garden sealed off, but even so, Ben had been fond of Mrs. Craven, and she made him promise to take care of her roses if ever she couldn't. So he's been using his trusty ladder to climb over the wall a couple of times a year to do a bit of pruning . Colin is glad that Ben has been helping--and that he can keep a secret, since Colin still wants to guard this as the Secret Garden. Colin is feeling so strong and garden-happy that he decides to plant a rose before the sun goes down. Ben and Dickon help Colin to dig a hole, and Colin stands and puts the rose in its new home just as the sun sets. Obviously, all of this is having a big psychological healing effect on young Colin.", "analysis": ""}
