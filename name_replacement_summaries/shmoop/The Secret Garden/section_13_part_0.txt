Martha freaks out: She thinks she'll lose her job, or that Colin will throw a fit now that a stranger has seen him. Mary promises Martha that it's okay. Colin likes her, after all. A bell rings summoning Martha, who comes back to bring Mary to Colin. Colin behaves toward Martha like some young king or lord or something; Mary compares him to a \"Rajah,\" which is a Sanskrit term for a prince. . Watching his bratty behavior, Mary tells Colin he is nothing at all like Dickon . As Mary and Colin sit together, Mrs. Medlock and Colin's doctor, Dr. Craven, come in. Dr. Craven thinks that Mary is exciting Colin too much, and that Colin should basically just lie there and think about being sick. Colin thinks that's stupid--Mary helps him forget about being sick, which is why he wants her there.", "analysis": ""}
