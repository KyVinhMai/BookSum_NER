Colin is so glad to hear it that he's willing to wait patiently until she comes back. Dickon brings his fox, his rook, and two new animal friends: tame squirrels named Nut and Shell. Back at the Manor, Mary tells Colin all about Dickon, his tame animals, and his moor horse named Jump. Colin tells Mary that he wants to see Dickon--a huge personal breakthrough, since, of course, Colin hates everybody. Mary promises Colin that Dickon will come the next day, with all his animals. And Mary finally brings Colin in on the secret: They have found the door to the walled garden and seen inside. Colin is overjoyed: He will live to see the inside of the Secret Garden.", "analysis": ""}
