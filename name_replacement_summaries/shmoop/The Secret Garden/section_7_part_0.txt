The next morning, Martha comes back from a visit with her family. Martha has a present for Mary from her mother: a jump rope, so she'll have something to play with. Mary isn't very strong, so she can't skip for long, but she likes her new toy. Mary takes her new jump rope out to the garden to show Ben Weatherstaff how much she can skip. He's impressed to see Mary acting like a kid instead of a sour old woman. As Mary is skipping about, she sees the robin again, and a gust of wind exposes the hidden knob of a door in the ivy-covered wall. Mary puts the key in the door and turns the knob. She opens the door to the secret garden.", "analysis": ""}
