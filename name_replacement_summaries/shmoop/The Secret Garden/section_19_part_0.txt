During this delay, Colin gets really into the idea of keeping the Secret Garden, well, secret. Clearly, the mystery is part of the garden's fascination for him. So Colin demands that the head gardener, Mr. Roach, come to his rooms. Mr. Roach has never actually met Colin, but he's surprised to find \"the young Rajah\" --in other words, the holy terror who has been bossing around the household since birth--sitting feeding a baby lamb with a bottle. Colin orders Mr. Roach to keep the gardeners away from the Long Walk by the garden walls when Colin is out there in his wheelchair. As Colin waits for afternoon to come, he realizes that he has never been outside to see springtime before. The nurse gets Colin ready to go outside, and he seems eager and happy--another big change from his earlier habits. Outside, Dickon pushes Colin's wheelchair as he takes breaths of fresh air and stares out at the moor. Mary tells the step-by-step story of how the robin showed her the key and the hidden door to the garden. Dickon pushes Colin into the Secret Garden and he sees its green beauty. And Colin exclaims: \"I shall get well! I shall get well!\"", "analysis": ""}
