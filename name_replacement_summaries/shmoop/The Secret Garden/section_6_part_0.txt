Spring is coming. Mary decides that she wants to visit Martha's cottage someday, to meet her mother and her brother Dickon. Even so, Mary is sure that Dickon won't like her--after all, no one does. Martha asks Mary if she likes herself, and Mary agrees that she doesn't like herself at all. Mary goes out to find Ben Weatherstaff working. He says that the spring flowers will soon be blooming. Mary sees the robin and decides to follow it. The robin leads her to a hole in the ground where some dog has been digging. In the hole is an old keyring--and Mary realizes that it might be the key to the locked garden.", "analysis": ""}
