It's all rainy and gloomy--not exactly the most cheerful start to Mary's new life in Yorkshire. As they drive in a horse-drawn carriage, they go past a large, barren patch of ground without any trees or anything. It's a moor. Mary takes one look at this big, empty, bleak stretch of land and decides, \"I don't like it\" . Approaching the large, low, dark house that will be Mary's new home, Mary only sees one light lit upstairs. A big set of doors leads to an enormous hall. A thin old man named Mr. Pitcher talks to Mrs. Medlock like Mary isn't even there. Mr. Pitcher tells Mrs. Medlock that it's her job to \"make sure that he's not disturbed and that he doesn't see what he doesn't want to see\" . We don't know who this \"he\" is yet, but one thing's pretty clear: \"He\" doesn't want to see Misstress Mary Quite Contrary any time soon.", "analysis": ""}
