Mary points out that Colin is a rude little brat, which people have put up with up until now because they thought he was dying. Colin seems to take this criticism to heart, but we think he keeps on being pretty rude and high-handed--we guess it's hard to get over the habits of a lifetime ... Over the months of the spring and summer, the garden really comes into its own. Ben starts telling more stories about Colin's mother. Colin decides that all of this--the quick growth of the garden, Dickon's ability with animals, Colin's own physical improvement--must be proof of Magic. He wants to do scientific experiments in Magic, and he wants Mary, Dickon, and Ben to help him. The Magic Colin describes is a kind of life force that makes everything happen: It makes the sun rise, the flowers bloom, all of that. When Colin began to walk, it was thanks to the Magic of Mary and Dickon insisting, \"You can do it! You can do it!\" . So now Colin wants to do his own Magic--if he thinks as often as possible, \"Magic is making me well! I am going to be as strong as Dickon!\" , it will come true--and Colin wants Ben, Mary, and Dickon to repeat these positive thoughts as well. They sit in a circle and Colin calls on the Magic, recognizing it in the world around them and calling on it for help. After this ritual, Colin walks around the garden confidently. But he decides to keep his recovery a secret from Dr. Craven. He wants to keep using his wheelchair up until the moment that he can cramatically reveal his new health. Most of all, Colin wants to impress his father.", "analysis": ""}
