She hates the temporary family she's staying with because there are lots of other kids and they won't let her have her own way all the time. In fact, one of them comes up with a nickname for her from a famous English nursery rhyme: \"Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\" . Mary sails over from India to London to live with her strange uncle Archibald Craven. Archibald Craven's housekeeper Mrs. Medlock doesn't exactly fall for Mary at first sight, either: she calls her \"a plain piece of goods\" . Mrs. Medlock explains that Archibald Craven lives in Misselthwaite Manor, a huge old place in the bleak Yorkshire countryside with over a hundred rooms, most of them locked. There isn't much else around. Archibald Craven also has a deformed back, which made his life pretty miserable until he met the right woman. He got married and lived happily until his wife died, leaving him an isolated, lonely man. He refuses to see people or to leave his house. All of this news--weird hermit uncle; giant, mostly empty house; gloomy, marshy countryside--does not leave Mary with a lot of confidence in her new home.", "analysis": ""}
