As Colin is weeding and working in the garden, he suddenly realizes that he is doing as good a job as Mary and Dickon. In fact, Colin has become completely well. He is so happy that he wants to sing--something. Ben Weatherstaff isn't religious, but he suggests the \"Doxology\" . Colin has never actually been to church, since he's been too sick, so Dickon does the singing. And Colin decides that his Magic and the God of the Doxology might be the same thing. As they are finishing up their singing, a woman walks into the garden: Mrs. Sowerby, Dickon's mother. As soon as Mrs. Sowerby sees Colin, she tells him that he is just like his mother, and that Mr. Craven has to come home right away to see. She also admires Mary, who is growing into a pretty girl. Mrs. Sowerby agrees that the Magic is just one name for what she calls \"the Good Thing\" . It doesn't matter what people call it, as long as they have faith. Mrs. Sowerby says they won't have to keep up this act of Colin's ill health for much longer--Mr. Craven will come home soon. As Colin is leaving that afternoon, he tells Mrs. Sowerby that he wishes she were his mother as well as Dickon's. Mrs. Sowerby is so moved that she promises Colin that his mother is in this garden with him--and, again, Mr. Craven will be home soon.", "analysis": ""}
