Mrs. Medlock tells Dr. Craven he won't believe it: That unpleasant little girl has shaken Colin right out of his tantrum. He's fine now. When Dr. Craven gets to Colin's room, he sees Colin happily chatting with Mary about flowers for the garden. Remember how we said that Dr. Craven is Mr. Craven's cousin? He's actually a little disappointed to hear that Colin's health is better, since he is next in line to inherit Misselthwaite Manor if Colin dies. Still, Dr. Craven isn't a bad guy, and he doesn't want to hurt Colin actively . He's impressed that Colin hasn't needed any medicine that day. The next morning, Mary comes running in to Colin's room to say that spring has officially sprung. And Dickon's on his way, with his squirrels and his rook and his fox and a newborn lamb he's raising since its mother died. Dickon shows Colin how he feeds his baby lamb out of a bottle. Colin is thrilled that he is going to see the Secret Garden in person at last.", "analysis": ""}
