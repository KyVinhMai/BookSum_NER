The sky is blue, the fruit trees are flowering--basically, everything is beautiful and amazing in the Secret Garden. Colin notices a very old tree with a broken branch in one corner; he wonders aloud how the branch might have broken. The robin appears and starts singing, distracting Colin from this line of questioning just in time. Needless to say, Mary and Dickon are relieved not to have to explain. As the sun is getting lower, Colin suddenly looks up and asks, \"Who is that man?\" . Mary and Dickon look up to see Ben Weatherstaff on top of a ladder, looking over the garden wall. Ben shakes his fist at Mary and yells at her, saying that she has no business being in there. Dickon wheels Colin's chair over to Ben so Colin can have his say. Colin asks if Ben realizes who he is. Ben sees Colin's resemblance to his tragically deceased mom, but he calls Colin \"th'poor cripple\" . Colin is so offended at Ben's assumption that his back and legs are crooked that he finally stands up on his own. Colin's legs are thin and weak because he has never used them, but there is nothing really wrong with him except fear. Now Colin has the confidence to tell Ben to leave them alone with their Secret Garden. For his part, Ben is quite overcome with emotion by the sight of Colin standing tall on his own.", "analysis": ""}
