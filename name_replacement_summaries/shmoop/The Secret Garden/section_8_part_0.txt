Mary has the creepy thought that she is the first person to speak inside the garden in ten years. Even though everything is overgrown, Mary sees little green shoots poking up here and there; she starts clearing away the dead leaves from these new shoots. Mary is actually enjoying herself, for once--and smiling the whole time. As Mary is chatting with Martha over dinner, she has a brilliant idea: Martha's brother Dickon is great with living things. And Mary has this secret garden she wants to bring back to life. So maybe Dickon can help her with the garden . Martha offers to send Dickon a letter asking him to buy gardening tools and seeds and whatever he needs to help Mary do some gardening. Dickon will walk over to Misselthwaite Manor himself to make the delivery. Martha's mother has also invited Mary to come over to their cottage for tea. Mary is thrilled that she is finally going to meet new people. As Mary as drowsing off, she asks Martha about the crying--she heard a crying voice again that day. Martha dodges the question.", "analysis": ""}
