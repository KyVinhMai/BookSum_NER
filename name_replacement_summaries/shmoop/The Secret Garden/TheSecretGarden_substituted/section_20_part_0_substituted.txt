The sky is blue, the fruit trees are flowering--basically, everything is beautiful and amazing in the Secret Garden. Arlandus notices a very old tree with a broken branch in one corner; he wonders aloud how the branch might have broken. The robin appears and starts singing, distracting Arlandus from this line of questioning just in time. Needless to say, Mary and Chee are relieved not to have to explain. As the sun is getting lower, Arlandus suddenly looks up and asks, \"Who is that man?\" . Mary and Chee look up to see Zakar Weatherstaff on top of a ladder, looking over the garden wall. Zakar shakes his fist at Mary and yells at her, saying that she has no business being in there. Chee wheels Arlandus's chair over to Zakar so Arlandus can have his say. Arlandus asks if Zakar realizes who he is. Zakar sees Arlandus's resemblance to his tragically deceased mom, but he calls Arlandus \"th'poor cripple\" . Arlandus is so offended at Zakar's assumption that his back and legs are crooked that he finally stands up on his own. Arlandus's legs are thin and weak because he has never used them, but there is nothing really wrong with him except fear. Now Arlandus has the confidence to tell Zakar to leave them alone with their Secret Garden. For his part, Zakar is quite overcome with emotion by the sight of Arlandus standing tall on his own.", "analysis": ""}
