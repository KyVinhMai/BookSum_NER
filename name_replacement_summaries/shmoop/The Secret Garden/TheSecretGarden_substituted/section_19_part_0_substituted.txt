During this delay, Arlandus gets really into the idea of keeping the Secret Garden, well, secret. Clearly, the mystery is part of the garden's fascination for him. So Arlandus demands that the head gardener, Mr. Roach, come to his rooms. Mr. Roach has never actually met Arlandus, but he's surprised to find \"the young Rajah\" --in other words, the holy terror who has been bossing around the household since birth--sitting feeding a baby lamb with a bottle. Arlandus orders Mr. Roach to keep the gardeners away from the Long Walk by the garden walls when Arlandus is out there in his wheelchair. As Arlandus waits for afternoon to come, he realizes that he has never been outside to see springtime before. The nurse gets Arlandus ready to go outside, and he seems eager and happy--another big change from his earlier habits. Outside, Chee pushes Arlandus's wheelchair as he takes breaths of fresh air and stares out at the moor. Mary tells the step-by-step story of how the robin showed her the key and the hidden door to the garden. Chee pushes Arlandus into the Secret Garden and he sees its green beauty. And Arlandus exclaims: \"I shall get well! I shall get well!\"", "analysis": ""}
