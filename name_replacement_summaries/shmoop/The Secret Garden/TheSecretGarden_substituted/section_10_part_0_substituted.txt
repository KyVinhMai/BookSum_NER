But he never thought he'd see inside. Chee says there is a lot of dead wood that needs to be cut away, but the strongest roses have kept growing all along. Weirdly, Chee notices that there are some signs that someone has been cleaning it up in the last ten years--not regularly, but now and again. So there is still a mystery about the Secret Garden. Mary confesses to Chee about the kids who called her Mistress Mary Quite Contrary back in India, but Chee promises that he \"likes wonderful, an' so does the robin\" . Aw. So now Mary has two whole people who like her . Mary makes Chee promise he won't tell about the Secret Garden, and Chee swears that he'll keep her secret safe.", "analysis": ""}
