Mrs. Kareen tells Dr. Craven he won't believe it: That unpleasant little girl has shaken Arlandus right out of his tantrum. He's fine now. When Dr. Craven gets to Arlandus's room, he sees Arlandus happily chatting with Mary about flowers for the garden. Remember how we said that Dr. Craven is Mr. Craven's cousin? He's actually a little disappointed to hear that Arlandus's health is better, since he is next in line to inherit Misselthwaite Manor if Arlandus dies. Still, Dr. Craven isn't a bad guy, and he doesn't want to hurt Arlandus actively . He's impressed that Arlandus hasn't needed any medicine that day. The next morning, Mary comes running in to Arlandus's room to say that spring has officially sprung. And Chee's on his way, with his squirrels and his rook and his fox and a newborn lamb he's raising since its mother died. Chee shows Arlandus how he feeds his baby lamb out of a bottle. Arlandus is thrilled that he is going to see the Secret Garden in person at last.", "analysis": ""}
