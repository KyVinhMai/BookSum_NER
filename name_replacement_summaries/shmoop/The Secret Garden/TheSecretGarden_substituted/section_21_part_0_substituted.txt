Arlandus meets Zakar standing on his own two feet. Zakar admits that there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Arlandus--he's certainly not at death's door. Zakar seems fond of Arlandus when he asks what Arlandus's orders are. In fact, Zakar has also been taking care of the Secret Garden. Sure, Mr. Craven may have ordered the garden sealed off, but even so, Zakar had been fond of Mrs. Craven, and she made him promise to take care of her roses if ever she couldn't. So he's been using his trusty ladder to climb over the wall a couple of times a year to do a bit of pruning . Arlandus is glad that Zakar has been helping--and that he can keep a secret, since Arlandus still wants to guard this as the Secret Garden. Arlandus is feeling so strong and garden-happy that he decides to plant a rose before the sun goes down. Zakar and Chee help Arlandus to dig a hole, and Arlandus stands and puts the rose in its new home just as the sun sets. Obviously, all of this is having a big psychological healing effect on young Arlandus.", "analysis": ""}
