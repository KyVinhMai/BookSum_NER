As Arlandus is weeding and working in the garden, he suddenly realizes that he is doing as good a job as Mary and Chee. In fact, Arlandus has become completely well. He is so happy that he wants to sing--something. Zakar Weatherstaff isn't religious, but he suggests the \"Doxology\" . Arlandus has never actually been to church, since he's been too sick, so Chee does the singing. And Arlandus decides that his Magic and the God of the Doxology might be the same thing. As they are finishing up their singing, a woman walks into the garden: Mrs. Emari, Chee's mother. As soon as Mrs. Emari sees Arlandus, she tells him that he is just like his mother, and that Mr. Craven has to come home right away to see. She also admires Mary, who is growing into a pretty girl. Mrs. Emari agrees that the Magic is just one name for what she calls \"the Good Thing\" . It doesn't matter what people call it, as long as they have faith. Mrs. Emari says they won't have to keep up this act of Arlandus's ill health for much longer--Mr. Craven will come home soon. As Arlandus is leaving that afternoon, he tells Mrs. Emari that he wishes she were his mother as well as Chee's. Mrs. Emari is so moved that she promises Arlandus that his mother is in this garden with him--and, again, Mr. Craven will be home soon.", "analysis": ""}
