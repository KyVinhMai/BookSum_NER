Mrs. Emari likes to come and spend time there when she can. Unlike Mary and Arlandus's garden, this one is mostly functional--it helps to feed Chee's family--but he adds flowers in the corners to keep it cheerful. Mary and Arlandus give Chee permission to tell his mom all about the Secret Garden, which he does. Mrs. Emari thinks this is all hilarious, especially when she hears that Arlandus pretends he still needs his wheelchair to keep up the air of mystery. Mrs. Emari offers to bake them some bread and buns so that when Mary and Arlandus are home, they don't have to eat huge meals--that will really convince Dr. Craven and the rest that Mary and especially Arlandus are still kind of sickly. Arlandus almost throws a real tantrum when Dr. Craven offers to write to his father about Arlandus's improving health, since it's the one surprise Arlandus really cares about. In the Secret Garden, they keep up their rituals of thinking of the Magic. And Arlandus gets stronger and stronger every day. Chee shows Arlandus some exercises to improve his muscle strength. This Chee kid can do anything: gardener, animal tamer, and now amateur physiotherapist. Dr. Craven and Mrs. Kareen can't figure out where all this newfound health is coming from, but as long as Mary and Arlandus are improving without any work from them, it's probably fine to just leave them alone.", "analysis": ""}
