Arlandus is so glad to hear it that he's willing to wait patiently until she comes back. Chee brings his fox, his rook, and two new animal friends: tame squirrels named Nut and Shell. Back at the Manor, Mary tells Arlandus all about Chee, his tame animals, and his moor horse named Jump. Arlandus tells Mary that he wants to see Chee--a huge personal breakthrough, since, of course, Arlandus hates everybody. Mary promises Arlandus that Chee will come the next day, with all his animals. And Mary finally brings Arlandus in on the secret: They have found the door to the walled garden and seen inside. Arlandus is overjoyed: He will live to see the inside of the Secret Garden.", "analysis": ""}
