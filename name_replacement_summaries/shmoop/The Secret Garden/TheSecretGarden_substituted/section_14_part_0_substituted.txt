Arlandus hates having people look at him, because whenever they do, he knows what they're thinking: that he's going to die. Still, he thinks that he could stand to meet Chee. The next morning, Mary gets up at dawn to find that it is spring. The weather is warm, and the moor is covered with green shoots, so she throws on her clothes and runs down to the Secret Garden, only to find that Chee has already beaten her there. Chee introduces her to a tame fox cub named Captain and a rook named Milan, who sits on Chee's shoulder. The Secret Garden has clumps of blooming spring crocuses, and everything seems filled with joy and life. Even the robin is busy building a nest. Mary tells Chee all about Arlandus. It turns out that Chee already knows that Arlandus exists, but he's never seen him. Chee thinks that Arlandus's problem is that he spends all of his time cooped up worrying. If Arlandus were outside watching the Secret Garden grow, he'd be too distracted by the surprises of nature to fret so much about himself.", "analysis": ""}
