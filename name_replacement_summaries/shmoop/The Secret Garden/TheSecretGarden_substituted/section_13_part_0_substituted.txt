Martha freaks out: She thinks she'll lose her job, or that Arlandus will throw a fit now that a stranger has seen him. Mary promises Martha that it's okay. Arlandus likes her, after all. A bell rings summoning Martha, who comes back to bring Mary to Arlandus. Arlandus behaves toward Martha like some young king or lord or something; Mary compares him to a \"Rajah,\" which is a Sanskrit term for a prince. . Watching his bratty behavior, Mary tells Arlandus he is nothing at all like Chee . As Mary and Arlandus sit together, Mrs. Kareen and Arlandus's doctor, Dr. Craven, come in. Dr. Craven thinks that Mary is exciting Arlandus too much, and that Arlandus should basically just lie there and think about being sick. Arlandus thinks that's stupid--Mary helps him forget about being sick, which is why he wants her there.", "analysis": ""}
