Suitcases are piled up--someone's getting ready to leave. Trigorin and Masha are talking and drinking. Masha confesses that she still loves Konstantin but plans to marry Medvedenko. She thinks marriage will cure her hopeless love. Nina enters; a moment with Trigorin. She gives him a present: a medallion inscribed with his initials and some pertinent quote from one of his novels. Arkadina interrupts their sweet moment. She really can't stand when the two of them are alone together. Sorin wants to go to Moscow with Arkadina and Trigorin. Arkadina dissuades him. Trigorin exits, looking for the book Nina referenced. Sorin and Arkadina have a conversation about Konstantin. He's tried to kill himself. Perhaps if you gave him a little money, suggests Sorin. No way, replies the stingy actress. Medvedenko and Konstantin enter. Medvedenko takes Sorin out. Arkadina changes the bandage on Konstantin's head. It's a very tender mother-son exchange until the subject of Trigorin comes up. Konstantin calls the guy a hack; Arkadina says he's just jealous. It gets pretty ugly and Konstantin starts crying. He's depressed at losing Nina. Trigorin returns: he's found the quote. Nina has written to him, \"If you ever need my life, come take it.\" He wants to stay. He wants to be with Nina. He begs Arkadina. Furious and hurt, she nevertheless figures out how to keep him with her instead. She flatters him into submission . The carriage arrives to take them to the train station. Goodbyes are said; Arkadina tips the cook and servants a measly dollar; Paulina cries. Everyone goes out but then Trigorin reenters. He has forgotten his walking stick. And who is there but Nina! They arrange to meet in Moscow.", "analysis": ""}
