We're still outside, but now on the side lawn, set up for croquet. It's the middle of the day. Dorn had been reading aloud when Arkadina initiates a competition between herself and Masha, with Dorn as the arbiter. Who looks younger, she asks? She gives Masha advice on looking her best. Masha is depressed and really couldn't care less. Arkadina takes up the reading when Sorin enters with Medvedenko and Nina. The group has a conversation about Maupassant, Konstantin's play, Sorin's health, and Dorn's experiences while traveling the world. Shamrayev and Paulina enter. Arkadina wanted to go into town, but Shamrayev won't let her have a horse to ride. She's furious. When they're alone, Paulina begs Dorn to take her away from the vulgar Shamrayev. Dorn clearly has no plans to do any such thing. Konstantin and Nina have a little tete-a-tete. He has killed a seagull in her honor. Nina's essentially, \"What? Gross.\" She has fallen out of love with him and he's in despair. Trigorin enters. Uh oh. Konstantin is insanely jealous of the older, successful writer . He leaves. Nina and Trigorin have a long conversation about writing. Nina is just enthralled by everything the man says. He explains that writing really doesn't give him pleasure, but that it's something he can't stop himself from doing. They are getting along very well. Arkadina comes in: Boris! Get back in here!", "analysis": ""}
