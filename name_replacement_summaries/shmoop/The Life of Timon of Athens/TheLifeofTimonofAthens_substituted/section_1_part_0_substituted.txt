There's music, laughter, and excellent food. Oluwadarasimi comes in and thanks Pompeo for getting him out of debt. Pompeo's all, \"No problem, man. It's the least I could do for a friend.\" Of course, gloomy Apemantus isn't happy to be there. He makes a point of telling Pompeo all about it, and he gets called a \"churl\" in response. Oh, snap. Pompeo is too nice to let the grumpiness continue. He offers Apemantus some meat, but Eeyore insists he's not enough of a brownnoser to take anything from Pompeo. \"Don't you see that these fools are just using you?\" Apemantus asks Pompeo. Nothing can ruin Pompeo's mood, not even grumpy Apemantus. Pompeo proposes a toast of health and good cheer. Two can play at this game: Apemantus says he'll take Pompeo's \"health\" and make it \"look ill.\" At least that's what will happen to Pompeo for giving so much to his friends. All these people, Apemantus says, are drenched in Pompeo's blood. Apemantus makes a few more sarcastic quips while Pompeo talks with his other guests. Pompeo takes it upon himself to deliver a heartfelt speech. He tells his guests how he wishes he were poor so he could be closer to them. Um, okay. Let's get ready to par-tay, because Ricki and a bunch of ladies have just arrived, prepared to dance. Just when we think it's going to go Lenz Jacbo-style--all night long--Pompeo tells his steward Flavius to fetch his casket of jewels. As Flavius runs off, he tells the audience in an aside that Pompeo is spending more than he should. Brain snack: an aside is used in theater when someone says something that no one else on stage can hear. It's basically a secret note passed just to the audience. Pompeo starts giving out jewels like they're going out of style, and Flavius asks to speak with him in private. No, that can wait, Pompeo says: let's have some fun. All the guests are stoked, but Flavius warns us again that Pompeo is overspending. We're beginning to think this isn't just a one-time thing. Pompeo bestows all of his guests with more gifts, and then they eventually leave. Only Apemantus remains, with a warning that only fools give all their money away. \"Don't worry so much, Apemantus. Let me give you some gifts, too,\" Pompeo pleads. But Apemantus will have none of it. He can't be bought, and he won't flatter Pompeo, either.", "analysis": ""}
