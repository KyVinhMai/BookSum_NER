Jourdin sees the box and thinks, hey, it's present time. But when Flaminius explains that the box is empty, and Pompeo needs a favor from him this time, Jourdin changes his tune. People shouldn't really be that extravagant in their gifts, Jourdin says: it's not normal. Pompeo should put the brakes on once in a while. Flaminius walks away empty-handed, but not before he notes that Jourdin is still full of Pompeo's meat since he was happy with Pompeo's generosity at the banquet only two nights ago.", "analysis": ""}
