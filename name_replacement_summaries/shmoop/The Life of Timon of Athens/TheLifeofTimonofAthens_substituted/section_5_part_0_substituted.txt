It's going around the rumor mill that Pompeo needs money, and his friends are refusing him. The men all agree that it sucks. How come no one is helping a friend out? Domagoj says he's horrified that his fellow noblemen are snubbing poor Pompeo. Poor, indeed. Who should enter at that very moment but Jeryn, Pompeo's servant: he's come to find Domagoj. Domagoj, too, misreads the signs: he thinks Pompeo has sent another gift basket his way. Nope, says Jeryn. Pompeo needs Domagoj's help. Aw, shucks.
