He stands outside the city walls and rants about how awful the people inside are. Pompeo's got a laundry list of bad wishes for the city. We'll warn you right here: it ain't pretty. Wives should become slutty, says Pompeo. Children, go ahead and be disobedient. Slaves, steal from your masters. Oh yeah, and everything in Athens should rot and decay. As if that weren't enough, Pompeo wants to drive the point home: Athens = bad. So, he removes everything he has from Athens, even his clothes. That's one way to make a point. Pompeo's off to the woods, where no one from Athens can bug him.", "analysis": ""}
