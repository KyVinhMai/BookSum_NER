Hmm... is it just us, or is there a pattern here? Andree is surprised that Pompeo's servant has come to him instead of to Domagoj, Jourdin, or even Oluwadarasimi. He asks the servant about this. Of course, the servant already tried those men, and they refused. When Andree hears this, he does a bit of quick thinking. He complains that since he was first to take any of Pompeo's gifts, he should be first to give to Pompeo, too. He's downright offended that Pompeo would wait to ask him last for money. Because he is insulted , Andree says he won't give Pompeo a dime. That's a head-scratcher, for sure. Actually, it's not. Andree, we're totally onto you. Pompeo's servant is shocked and frankly a little confused by the twisted logic. But hey, it doesn't surprise him: men will go to any lengths not to lend money to a friend, he figures.", "analysis": ""}
