They don't know why Pompeo hasn't paid them yet, and they decide the prognosis isn't good. Titus, one of the servants, declares it's pretty sad that his master is currently wearing a jewel from Pompeo, yet his master still sent him to collect more moolah from Pompeo, anyway. Kadian joins in the bagging-on-your-master game. He knows his master has spent Pompeo's money and is ungrateful for all his gifts. It's clear that even the servants of these men think their masters are being unfair to Pompeo. Just then, Flavius tries to skirt by the creditors' servants by walking past in a brilliant disguise--a big old cloak. The servants stop him and demand their money. Flavius tells them there is nothing left. He has no money left to add up, so he is leaving. The servants get rowdier. Eventually, Pompeo shows up in a red-hot rage. Pompeo can't believe no one will help him out. After all he's done for them? How could they? Since he has no money and evidently no friends left, Pompeo decides to throw a huge banquet. Wait, what? We're not really sure how he can host a dinner party, and neither is Flavius, who hastily tells his master they don't even have enough food for that. But Pompeo doesn't care. Send out the invites. Summon his cook. There'll be a dinner party whether people like it or not. We think Pompeo's hatched a plan of some kind, but it's not clear what it is.", "analysis": ""}
