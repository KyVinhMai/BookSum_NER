He's charged with killing another man, so he must die. Alcibiades disagrees: we should pity people, he says. Plus, this isn't just any murder: the guy killed in self-defense.

Alcibiades pleads with them again and again, but it does no good. The Senators get sick of arguing and banishhim. Phew. Guess they really don't like to be challenged. Once the Senators leave, Alcibiades curses them and swears that he will show them.", "analysis": ""}
