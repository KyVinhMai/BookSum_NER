It's going around the rumor mill that Timon needs money, and his friends are refusing him. The men all agree that it sucks. How come no one is helping a friend out? Lucius says he's horrified that his fellow noblemen are snubbing poor Timon. Poor, indeed. Who should enter at that very moment but Servilius, Timon's servant: he's come to find Lucius. Lucius, too, misreads the signs: he thinks Timon has sent another gift basket his way. Nope, says Servilius. Timon needs Lucius's help. Aw, shucks.
