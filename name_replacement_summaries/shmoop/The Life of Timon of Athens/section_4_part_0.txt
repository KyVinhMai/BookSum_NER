Lucullus sees the box and thinks, hey, it's present time. But when Flaminius explains that the box is empty, and Timon needs a favor from him this time, Lucullus changes his tune. People shouldn't really be that extravagant in their gifts, Lucullus says: it's not normal. Timon should put the brakes on once in a while. Flaminius walks away empty-handed, but not before he notes that Lucullus is still full of Timon's meat since he was happy with Timon's generosity at the banquet only two nights ago.", "analysis": ""}
