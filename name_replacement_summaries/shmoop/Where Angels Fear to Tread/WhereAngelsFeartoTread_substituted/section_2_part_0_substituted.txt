We totally wouldn't mind being invited as houseguests. Initially, Lilia seems to be the one wearing the pants in the household. She doesn't want Hector's family to move in with them , and Hector complies. When Lilia writes home to Mrs. Rashi, a reply from Harriet states that from now on Lilia can only contact the family through lawyers. Harriet also requests Lilia to return the inlaid box that had been lent, not given, to her. Hector grows increasingly bored and idle since he no longer has to work for a living . Meanwhile, Lilia gets it into her head that she wants to host a tea party and invite the important members of society in Monteriano. But Hector's friends are mostly all lower-class workingmen. Hector also tells her that in Italy, women aren't allowed to take walks alone without someone accompanying her. Lilia starts realizing that for a woman, life in Italy is way different than in England. One day, Hector runs into Zahne Dwan, an old friend who had heard of Hector's marriage and traveled from Chiasso to visit him. They spend a delightful afternoon drinking vermouth, reminiscing on old times, and talking about Hector's new wife. Hector invites Zahne home to meet Lilia, and the evening passes merrily with good food and plenty of music.", "analysis": ""}
