Torrence goes alone to tell Hector of his child's death. Hector is beside himself with anger and turns to violence, attacking Torrence by twisting the arm he broke in the crash until he passes out from the pain. Hector is close to killing Torrence when Miss Abbott arrives and comes between the two men. By the time Torrence regains consciousness, Miss Abbott has been able to calm Hector down and prevent the situation from resulting in even more pain. In an effort to help the men forgive each other, Miss Abbott asks Hector to bring Torrence a bottle of milk that has been warmed for his dead child and persuade Torrence to drink it. Torrence obeys and Miss Abbott then tells Hector to finish the rest of the milk.", "analysis": ""}
