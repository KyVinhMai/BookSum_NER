Everything is totally hunky-dory. He suddenly has a ton of vivid memories about living in America and how lame it was by comparison. Right now, he's looking out over beautiful meadows. Back then, he was looking at cardboard factories. Yep, sounds pretty dull. He eventually ends up at a nice little country inn and orders himself some dinner. While the dinner is getting ready, he takes a walk down to a river and looks out at a couple riding along in a boat. But something is wrong. Something in the boat grabs his attention. And you know what that means. Cliffhanger!", "analysis": ""}
