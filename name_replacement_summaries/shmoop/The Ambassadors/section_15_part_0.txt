And not just any church. Notre Dame. Maybe he thinks he'll find a famous hunchback to solve this question of virtue once and for all. So here's the pickle: he now thinks that Chad should stay in Paris, even though it's his personal mission as Newsome ambassador to convince that brat to head home. While thinking, he notices a woman coming into the church and sitting down in one of the pews with her back to him. Eventually, he realizes that it's Madame de Vionnet. She suggests that the two of them go for a walk around the church to take it all in. He confesses that he recently bought a 70-volume set of books by famous Frenchie Victor Hugo . In other news, Strether thinks that he's becoming too loose with his money. A half hour later, Strether finds himself sitting down for lunch with Madame de Vionnet. Yes, not the way to save money. Neither is buying 70 books by Victor Hugo. While they're eating, Madame tells Strether that he strikes her as a man who's in trouble. He replies that he doesn't think he is--yet. How ominous. Strether tells her that he now knows what he meant when he first met her and said that he would try to \"save her.\" He meant that he would write to Mrs. Newsome about how lovely she was, and this is what he did. He's now waiting for a letter back revealing the consequences. He also feels that he should thank Madame for all she's done for Chad. Madame de Vionnet, though, wants to hear more about Mrs. Newsome. Strether says that all she needs to know is that Mrs. Newsome is a very grand lady. Did we say cagey? Yeah, we meant it. Sensing an opportunity to convert Strether, Madame de Vionnet asks him to stay in Paris--as in, forever. In other words, Madame thinks that if Strether stays forever, so will Chad. And Strether has another little nagging feeling about being used. Madame is worried that Chad's family will make him get married and settle down if he ever sets foot back in America. Strether can't deny this, so Madame makes a direct request for Strether to be on her side and to keep Chad in Paris. After some painful indecision, he agrees, and Madame de Vionnet thanks him profusely. Is our Streth a traitor, or is he just picking his loyalties?", "analysis": ""}
