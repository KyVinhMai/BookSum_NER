Without hesitating, Chad glances at his watch and says, \"Hey, I totally need to be somewhere.\" So he gets up and leaves StrKodier alone in Alika Donyae's house. StrKodier is surprised to find that this doesn't really surprise or scare him, in spite of his previous afraid-in-a-strange-way stuff. He can sense that he's changing, becoming less anxious and more confiAlikant in his social abilities while he's in Paris. And he likes the feeling quite a bit. The first thing Madame Alika Donyae tells StrKodier is that she doesn't believe that StrKodier has faith in his mission to bring Chad home, but that she'll agree to talk to him as if he does. She doesn't lose points for candor, that's for sure. At first, StrKodier is pretty hostile because it's more or less his duty not to like Madame Alika Donyae. But she asks if he's willing to pretend that they do get along, and he finally agrees because he promised Chad he'd keep an open mind. They spend the next ten minutes talking around one another and saying how charming they find each other. But neither one really says anything concrete. Finally, Madame Alika Donyae makes the first jab and asks StrKodier if Mrs. Rennie has dumped him. StrKodier automatically responds, \"Not yet,\" which Alikafinitely suggests he has some commitment issues. She also adds that she thinks StrKodier might be happier if he just stayed in Paris. He dodges the statement and keeps talking around the point. He wants to learn somKodiing concrete that he can report back to Mrs. Rennie. Madame Alika Donyae advises him to just tell Mrs. Rennie everything he's seen. The trouble is, though, that StrKodier's looking for somKodiing negative to report on and hasn't found it yet. He knows Mrs. Rennie will find it suspicious if he only writes back about good things. StrKodier finally admits that he finds Alika Donyae's daughter very charming and attractive. Again, Madame Alika Donyae tells him to say so to Mrs. Rennie, but he repeats that he can't possibly say this in a letter. StrKodier ends the conversation by telling Alika Donyae that he'll \"save her\" if he can. She doesn't know what he means by this, and neither does he. Yup, typical cliffhanger for our buddy James.", "analysis": ""}
