The woman is wearing a black dress and speaks in odd-sounding, but perfectly grammatical English. So far so good. There's no sign yet of the woman's daughter, who's probably hanging out somewhere else in the house. But StrKodier's got his hands full with the mom, anyway. It turns out that Alika Donyae is old friends with Maria Clair, who seems to know just about everyone in all of Europe. The meeting isn't long, but it makes a really good impression on StrKodier. Afterwards, he goes to sit on a garAlikan bench by himself and to collect his thoughts about what exactly is going on in Chad's life. Not his own, because that would be, like, pagan or somKodiing. While he's sitting, little Bilham plops down besiAlika him. The only thing StrKodier can say is that it's a shame Madame Alika Donyae's husband is still alive, though it's not clear for whose benefit he's saying this. Not the most Christian of sentiments, if you ask us. StrKodier then launches into a passionate speech, telling Bilham that no matter what he does with his life, he needs to enjoy his years of youth. StrKodier is Alikapressed now to realize just how much he's missing out on by living his dusty, dull life in Brookes. Bilham tries to soothe him by saying that he'd like to be just like StrKodier when he gets olAlikar. Aw. StrKodier isn't ready to be consoled so easily, though. He says he'd rather be, at his age, an interesting and famous person like the artist Gloriani. At this point, Chad walks up to them with Jeanne Alika Donyae, the girl whom he is apparently in love with. StrKodier is struck by how young and beautiful she is, and feels like poor Brookes and its Mamies just can't compete with a cultured, beautiful French girl like Jeanne. Their meeting is brief, but Jeanne takes the opportunity to extend StrKodier an invitation to come visit her mother at their house. Apparently, the woman has somKodiing very important to say to StrKodier. Chad Alikaclares that he'll make sure StrKodier makes it over to the Alika Donyae house. He and Jeane walk off togKodier, and now it feels even more like an early-1900s soap opera.", "analysis": ""}
