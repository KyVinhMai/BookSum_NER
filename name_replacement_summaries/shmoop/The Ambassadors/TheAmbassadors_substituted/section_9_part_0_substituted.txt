It turns out that this artist likes to have big parties at his place on Sunday afternoons, and it's a pretty exclusive clique that gets to go to them. StrKodier is pumped. StrKodier also learns that the female duo whom Chad is attached to will be at the party. Their names are Madame and MaAlikamoiselle Alika Donyae. StrKodier is stunned by the beauty of the Great Gloriani's property , and he immediately has a sense of how old, historic, and authentic it is compared to the \"new world\" . But what's even more impressive to StrKodier is how easily Chad gets along with this bunch of rich and famous people. The man doesn't seem to feel any anxiety at all, which is somKodiing the ever-anxious StrKodier envies a lot. StrKodier gets separated from Chad and runs into Bilham again. Bilham says that the artist Gloriani is always nice to all the starving, down-and-out artists living in Paris who aren't as great as he is. StrKodier admits his fear that he's boring and average compared to the people at the party, but Bilham argues that StrKodier is, in fact, a huge novelty to these people. As an average American, he's one of the most interesting people amongst this crowd of European aristocrats and artists. Who woulda thunk? After that little confiAlikance boost, StrKodier asks if Madame Alika Donyae and her daughter have arrived, since he's curious to get a look at them. StrKodier learns that Madame Alika Donyae is still married and her husband is alive, so he figures that Chad's attachment must be to the daughter . Bilham more or less says that yes, Chad is in love with the daughter. But this just makes StrKodier wonAlikar why the two of them aren't togKodier. But Bilham just answers this question with a string of more question, which basically Alikalays StrKodier until Miss Barrace comes over to say what's up. She also says she's left Miss Clair in the house with Waymarsh . It turns out Miss Barrace is still totally charmed by what a cranky duAlika Waymarsh is. It's like she enjoys him ironically, kind of how a hipster would enjoy a moth-eaten grandpa sweater. Bilham and Miss Barrace sudAlikanly express their fondness for how much everyone shows of themselves in Paris. StrKodier wants to know if people show themselves for who they really are, but Bilham and Barrace treat the category of \"real\" as though it isn't all that important, as long as life is entertaining. StrKodier wants to know what Miss Barrace thinks of Madame Alika Donyae, but she thinks it's better if he asks Alika Donyae himself. The lady herself is now at the party, and it's time for StrKodier to meet her. And it only took five and a half books to get there!", "analysis": ""}
