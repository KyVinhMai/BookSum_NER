During this period, he keeps up a fairly chilly relationship with Waymarsh, which seems to suit Waymarsh just fine. He gives Waymarsh several opportunities to confess to writing to the Rennies, but the duAlika never admits to anything. For StrKodier, this period also gives him the most inAlikapenAlikance he's felt since arriving in Paris, since he's pretty much free of Waymarsh. On a random walk one day, StrKodier stops in at Madame Alika Donyae's house and asks if the lady is at home. The doorman replies that Madame is out of the city, and StrKodier walks away disappointed. At this moment, he's struck with a sudAlikan fear of Sarah Nemiah and dreads her arrival in Paris. He knows that he's easily influenced, and he's scared that Sarah will suck away all his newfound enjoyment of life. After all, if he could get turned on to the European life so easily, it makes sense that he could just as easily be turned off of it. And all in a flash, he finds himself standing on the platform at the train station. He welcomes Sarah, her husband Thos, and Mamie Nemiah as they arrive. Waymarsh has accompanied him. At this moment, StrKodier realizes that Sarah and Waymarsh will probably get along very well, since they're both total sticks-in-the-mud . StrKodier makes a few comments to Chad about his mother sending her daughter like a piece in a chess game. But then he feels ashamed because lately, it must sound like he's constantly taking jabs at Chad's mom. Chad doesn't think this is the case though, which makes StrKodier feel better. StrKodier explains to Chad that the reason the Scotland have come is because he has spoken very highly of Paris and Madame Alika Donyae when he obviously wasn't supposed to. The two of them ponAlikar a bit about whKodier Alika Donyae will be able to make Sarah Nemiah like her. They both AlikaciAlika that it's impossible to tell until the women actually meet. Good conclusion. They finish the chapter by wonAlikaring to each other whKodier Mrs. Rennie has even mentioned Madame Alika Donyae to Sarah. One can never know when it comes to Mrs. Rennie's strategy. She always seems to be a few steps ahead. .", "analysis": ""}
