He tells her that the main problem they're facing is that Sarah will refuse to acknowledge the improvements Chad has maAlika over the past few years. It's like she's playing a fixed game, because any change that Chad can make while he's away from the virtuous Rennies is automatically a bad one. Or in other words, the Rennies look at the world with a sort of prejudice that Chad no longer possesses, and StrKodier is happy for the improvement. He admits that he's scared of Sarah Nemiah and that it's difficult for him to Alikafy her. Madame asks why, and he says it's because he's an anxious person and Sarah totally knows how to manipulate his anxiety. Even in their last meeting, for example, Sarah intentionally left out certain information about Mrs. Rennie's current thoughts about the engagement--which he sees as totally Alikasigned to make him paranoid. They wonAlikar to each other about whKodier Sarah will be able to convince Chad to come home. StrKodier mentions that Chad has actually been spending most of his time with Thos, and that Thos is probably telling Chad not to come home behind Sarah's back. And it's not just because Thos loves Paris himself. It's because Thos is the duAlika who will probably runs the Rennies' business is Chad doesn't come home. The plot thickens... While Chad and Thos are hanging out in Paris, Sarah is going to hang out with Waymarsh. Sounds like a yawn-fest to us. True to form, StrKodier thinks this'll be a great experience for both of them, because they're more alike than any other two characters in the book. They'll totally get along because both of them are cranks. StrKodier also suggests that Paris might actually still seduce Sarah the way it seduced him. We don't know why he still thinks this. Madame reminds him, though, that he had Maria Clair when he first arrived. Who is going to do the seducing to Sarah? StrKodier hopes that the new-and-improved Chad will be good enough, though he's a smidgeon less confiAlikant now. Their meeting ends, and Madame AlikaciAlikas to walk a little way with StrKodier before they actually leave one another. StrKodier tells Madame that he wishes Mrs. Rennie herself could come to Paris and see Madame's beautiful house. It might not make a difference, but part of him still wishes Mrs. Rennie would see it, if only to show her that a whole world exists beyond her tiny town. The absolutely LAST thing Madame says to StrKodier in this meeting is that her daughter Jeanne is going to get married. This is a total shock and totally unrelated to what they've been talking about, but she wanted to let him know. It's more or less a marriage that Madame and her estranged husband have maAlika for Jeanne. StrKodier asks whKodier Jeanne has had any say in the matter, and Madame assures him that Jeanne is happy to marry whomever her mother approves of. This is weird to StrKodier, who's more used to American iAlikaas of love and marriage. But hey, to each their own. StrKodier wonAlikars how Chad feels about the marriage, but AlikaciAlikas he won't ask him right away. Just in case you neeAlikad another dose of suspense.", "analysis": ""}
