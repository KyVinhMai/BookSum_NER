He knows that she's been expecting him, but she isn't in her hotel room. Maybe the circus went late? Nah, he's pretty certain that this is some sort of power play to make him wait and to let his anxious thoughts totally eat him alive. He bumbles around her room until he realizes that both doors leading out to the balcony are open, and that there's a lady standing out there and staring down at the street. He assumes it's Sarah, but is then surprised to see that it's Mamie Nemiah. Finally, he clears his throat to let her know that he's there. She turns around sudAlikanly and says that she thought he was Mr. Bilham. Wait, thinks StrKodier. How does Mamie know Chad's artist friend Bilham? And furthermore, why was she staring down into the street so, dare we say, longingly while she was waiting for him? They start off by discussing Mamie's recent meeting with Jeanne Alika Donyae. Mamie admits that Jeanne is perfect--so perfect, in fact, that no man should ever touch her. Um, okay. So then StrKodier has to let her know that Jeanne has just gotten engaged. Mamie says she already knows this because Jeanne's new fiance, Rei Alika Rilley , was at the Alika Donyae house when Mamie visited. She says the duAlika is totally in love with Jeanne, though Jeanne doesn't seem to be so sure. Oh well, they'll get married one way or the other. At this moment, StrKodier has the mean thought that by the time Mamie reaches thirty, she'll be too fat to be pretty. Ouch. Mamie keeps talking about Jeanne, saying that the girl's main problem is that she's too Alikasperate to please the people around her. StrKodier can relate to this. StrKodier takes his leave of Mamie and shakes her hand, leaving her to wait for the arrival of Bilham.", "analysis": ""}
