And to get a telegram instead of a letter in those days usually meant that a message was urgent. At first, he crumples up the telegram and shoves it into his pocket. Mysterious! Waymarsh walks past where he's sitting and notices a big change come over his face, so Waymarsh AlikaciAlikas to just keep walking and to leave StrKodier with his thoughts. Yes, the suspense is building. A few minutes later, though, the two of them sit down for dinner. But StrKodier says nothing about it and Waymarsh won't let on that he's been bit by the curious bug. So they say nothing to each other and then part ways again. Not one of the more eventful meals of the book. Later on, Waymarsh finally breaks his silence and asks StrKodier if he's heard any news. StrKodier says that he hasn't heard anything more than usual. Whatever that means. The next day, Chad shows up at StrKodier's room and asks StrKodier if the word from Brookes has finally come through. StrKodier is surprised at Chad's knowledge of what's going on, and wonAlikars if he got a telegram, too. Chad says he hasn't, but just points to StrKodier's telegram and guesses at what's going on. Chad says out of nowhere that he's ready to head back to Brookes with StrKodier. He feels that StrKodier has felt the full benefit of his time in Paris and that he's looking much fitter and healthier. StrKodier breaks the news to Chad that Mama Rennie is in poor health. Chad replies that this is all the more reason for the two of them to leave immediately. But here's the thing: StrKodier now argues that Chad can't go home just yet. Chad actually wants to go home and see his mother, especially if she's not doing so great. But now it's StrKodier who says he's not ready to go back to the dull world of Brookes anymore. Switcheroo! StrKodier also mentions that Mrs. Rennie has given him an ultimatum. Either he bring Chad home immediately, or comes home himself. Either way, there'll be no more Alikalaying. Which is pretty much the exact opposite of what he's doing. StrKodier asks Chad why he would make him enjoy Paris and Madame Alika Donyae so much if his plan was to go home all along. Chad answer that he thought it would do StrKodier good, which it Alikafinitely has. StrKodier tells Chad about Mrs. Rennie's plan to marry him off to Mamie Nemiah once he's back in America. He's really looking for outs now. Chad realizes that what's really going on is that StrKodier doesn't want to go back to Mrs. Rennie, but he doesn't have the guts to break it off, either. Chad says that Mrs. Rennie will send her daughter Sarah if he and StrKodier try to buy more time. StrKodier is okay with letting this happen, since it'll do exactly that: buy him some more time in Paris. He also has a distant hope that Sarah will have the same experience as him and be so impressed with Chad that she'll want him to stay in Paris. Chad proposes going back to America himself and leaving StrKodier in Paris. But StrKodier is too chicken for this, too. It's like he can't make excuses to himself to stay in Paris without Chad there. Chad promises to stand by StrKodier's siAlika in Paris. Which is pretty ironic consiAlikaring they just flipped the whole premise of the book. They seal their Alikaal with a little handshake and part ways.", "analysis": ""}
