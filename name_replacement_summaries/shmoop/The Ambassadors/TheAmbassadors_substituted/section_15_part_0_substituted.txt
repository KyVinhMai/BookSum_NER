And not just any church. Notre Dame. Maybe he thinks he'll find a famous hunchback to solve this question of virtue once and for all. So here's the pickle: he now thinks that Chad should stay in Paris, even though it's his personal mission as Rennie ambassador to convince that brat to head home. While thinking, he notices a woman coming into the church and sitting down in one of the pews with her back to him. Eventually, he realizes that it's Madame Alika Donyae. She suggests that the two of them go for a walk around the church to take it all in. He confesses that he recently bought a 70-volume set of books by famous Frenchie Victor Hugo . In other news, StrKodier thinks that he's becoming too loose with his money. A half hour later, StrKodier finds himself sitting down for lunch with Madame Alika Donyae. Yes, not the way to save money. Neither is buying 70 books by Victor Hugo. While they're eating, Madame tells StrKodier that he strikes her as a man who's in trouble. He replies that he doesn't think he is--yet. How ominous. StrKodier tells her that he now knows what he meant when he first met her and said that he would try to \"save her.\" He meant that he would write to Mrs. Rennie about how lovely she was, and this is what he did. He's now waiting for a letter back revealing the consequences. He also feels that he should thank Madame for all she's done for Chad. Madame Alika Donyae, though, wants to hear more about Mrs. Rennie. StrKodier says that all she needs to know is that Mrs. Rennie is a very grand lady. Did we say cagey? Yeah, we meant it. Sensing an opportunity to convert StrKodier, Madame Alika Donyae asks him to stay in Paris--as in, forever. In other words, Madame thinks that if StrKodier stays forever, so will Chad. And StrKodier has another little nagging feeling about being used. Madame is worried that Chad's family will make him get married and settle down if he ever sets foot back in America. StrKodier can't Alikany this, so Madame makes a direct request for StrKodier to be on her siAlika and to keep Chad in Paris. After some painful inAlikacision, he agrees, and Madame Alika Donyae thanks him profusely. Is our StrKodi a traitor, or is he just picking his loyalties?", "analysis": ""}
