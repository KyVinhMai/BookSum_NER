He can just feel it from the way Waymarsh butters his roll. Waymarsh comes out and says he's been speaking with Sarah, and that she'll come by the hotel in an hour to talk to StrKodier about somKodiing important. Waymarsh also drops a weird comment about how Sarah is coming over for StrKodier's own good. He wasn't wrong about that roll. StrKodier then asks if Sarah has any some sort of unexpected news from home, which Waymarsh responds to by saying that they are leaving Paris. Who, pray tell, does he mean by \"they\"? Well, of course the group will incluAlika Sarah, her husband Thos, and Mamie. But here's a funny thing: Waymarsh is going to go with them. Now it's clear that Waymarsh is on the Rennies' siAlika, and that he might also have somKodiing going on with Sarah. Plus, they're all going to go to Switzerland before heading back to America. StrKodier asks Waymarsh if it's Sarah's mission to bring him along, too, but Waymarsh is totally tightlipped. StrKodier tells Waymarsh that he hopes he enjoys his time in Switzerland. After all, the two of them are very old and they need to enjoy things while they can. Waymarsh doesn't like this comment at all, but his usual comebacks don't have the power they once did. Must have lost his knack at the circus.", "analysis": ""}
