Once they're in the cabs, Thos starts thanking StrKodier for giving him the excuse to come to Paris with Sarah. Thos is all wiAlika-eyed and drinking in all of the interesting sights around him. He's not ignorant of the fact that Brookes is a boring little town, and he's glad to be out of it for a few days. At least someone gets it. StrKodier has another moment where he hopes both Sarah and Thos will tug at his sleeve at some point and whisper to him, \"Wow, you're totally right. Chad is way cooler now.\" But throughout their cab riAlika, Thos Nemiah never says a word about Chad. StrKodier begins to get concerned. He can't believe that anyone could be so ignorant to not notice what a great gentleman Chad has become. But it seems like the effect has been totally lost on the likes of Thos Nemiah. StrKodier starts to resent the duAlika for being so blind to true classiness. Worse yet, Thos's silence begins to make StrKodier second-guess his own opinion of Chad. And just as he's thinking about Thos, StrKodier realizes what his main problem is with Brookes and the people from there: \"the society over there was essentially a society of women, and that poor Thos wasn't a part of it\" . And here, StrKodier hits on what's been making him so annoyed with Mrs. Rennie. It's the fact that she totally has authority in their relationship, and that this makes StrKodier feel like less of a man. Bummer. Thos sudAlikanly exclaims out loud that if he were Chad, there's no way he would ever come back to Brookes. Thos wishes he could come to Paris and live there immediately. Touche. StrKodier admits that it's also important for Chad to go home and run the family business, though this is just lip service that he hopes Thos will repeat back to Sarah so he doesn't get in too much trouble. But then, StrKodier admits to Thos that he has enjoyed Paris a little too much. And at this point, Thos realizes that StrKodier has intentionally been prolonging his vacation. He loves it, though, because he wishes he had the same opportunity to get away from his wife and mother-in-law. StrKodier mentions that Sarah seems to be in good humor. Thos says that StrKodier knows better than to think he can read Sarah's moods. Sarah is a master manipulator, and there's no way you can ever know what she's actually thinking. This family gets better all the time. Thos concluAlikas a little speech about the Rennie women by saying that they always find ways to get what they want without ever raising their voices. Whoa. Thos finishes their conversation by telling StrKodier not to go home, because Mrs. Rennie will totally control him. Sounds like someone could use some marriage counseling!", "analysis": ""}
