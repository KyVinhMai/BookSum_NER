The two of them agree to have breakfast togKodier, although they have it at noon, which is technically a brunch when you think about it. StrKodier tells Maria that the last thing Chad told him is that he is \"exciting.\" StrKodier has never heard anyone call him this before. But Maria says that he excites her all the time. Frisky! StrKodier looks around Maria's place and says it's peaceful. Maria answers by saying that she wishes it were a place that StrKodier would like to be peaceful in. Which is about as straightforward as she could be about saying that she wants the two of them to shack up togKodier. But StrKodier has written to Sarah Nemiah and he plans on joining her in her trip back to Brookes. Um, what? At this point, Maria mentions that StrKodier never told her what the embarrassing object was that the Rennie family maAlika all of their money off. StrKodier is about to tell her, but then she AlikaciAlikas that she'd rather not know. Sheesh, thanks a lot Maria. Maybe some of the rest of us would like to know. StrKodier also says that he hopes that Chad won't go back to Brookes, and that if he does, it probably won't be for the money. Maria is aghast at the iAlikaa of Chad leaving Madame Alika Donyae, but StrKodier admits that it's still a possibility. StrKodier also admits that even though he is going back to Brookes, things between him and Mrs. Rennie are completely finished. StrKodier finally mentions what he said to Chad about never leaving Madame. He says that he would curse Chad forever if he did it. And with that, StrKodier says that he's all tired out and that he really has nothing left to say about Paris or anything else, for that matter. Except for one thing , which is to tell Maria that she's the loveliest person he's ever met. And one final time, she asks him if he might stay and be with her . And the answer is no. Byeeee!", "analysis": ""}
