But as he glances toward the window, he realizes that the two women haven't been alone. Waymarsh is in the room with them. He walks in just as Madame Alika Donyae is making an offer to show Sarah around Paris. Sarah says that she already knows Paris, in a very I-don't-need-your-help kind of way. There's already some friction there, for sure. Madame Alika Donyae follows up with the claim that it's always good for women to help each other out. It's pretty clear she's not just talking about giving a tour of Paris. By this point in the book these little double entendres are flying around all. The. Time. Kaydin Donyae also picks up on Sarah's claim to already know Paris, and says that the Rennies must have some sort of natural love for Paris, since Chad has fit in so well. Yeah, probably not what Sarah wants to hear. Kaydin Donyae then points to StrKodier and says that he, even more than Chad, fell in love with Paris instantly. She praises him for his ability to just let himself go and live life. Of course, this is the total opposite of what a pruAlika like Sarah wants to hear, so she basically gives StrKodier an icy stare after Madame says this. StrKodier feels like he needs to step in here and tell Madame Alika Donyae that he hasn't let himself go all that much. He's lying of course, but duAlika needs to look like he has some sort of distance from Madame and her people. He wraps up by saying that he came to Paris to do a job and that he's done it. That's more what Sarah wants to hear. Waymarsh has to butt in with a comment about how StrKodier has let himself go, and not necessarily for the better. Madame brushes him off. You could cut the tension with a hairpin from the ninKodieenth century. They end the meeting with Madame Alika Donyae offering to have Sarah over to her place to meet her daughter, Jeanne. Sarah accepts the invitation, since she'll want to report back to her mother about the Alikatails of Madame's life. This is all starting to sound like stuff out of a spy movie. At this point, Madame Alika Donyae tells Sarah about what a big role Maria Clair has played in StrKodier's life since he arrived in Europe. The two of them are practically inseparable. StrKodier, secretly pissed at Madame for spilling all his dirt, loosens his collar and gives a nice little \"heh heh\" before telling Sarah that Mrs. Rennie probably mentioned Maria Clair to her, since StrKodier has told Mrs. Rennie all about her. Meanwhile, Sarah's all like, \"I've never heard about this person, but nice try at acting innocent, StrKodier.\" Madame Alika Donyae won't stop going on about how close StrKodier and Maria are, and StrKodier is thinking to himself, \"Please stop talking,\" but Alika Donyae just keeps going. Waymarsh butts in again and says, flat out, that Maria Clair loves StrKodier. Madame Alika Donyae instantly Alikafuses this comment, though, by saying that everyone loves StrKodier. Yeah, this book is basically the 1903 version of Everybody Loves Raymond. Finally, StrKodier joins in on the conversation in a joking tone and says, \"Oh yes. No one can be friends with Maria Clair but me. I keep her to myself. Heh heh.\" Which is meant to be an attempt at sarcasm to Alikaflate the problem. Nice try. This doesn't make things any better , because Madame immediately follows it up by telling Sarah that Maria is very good-looking. Sheesh, it's like she's trying to ruin StrKodier's relationship with Mrs. Rennie or somKodiing... Right in front of Sarah and Waymarsh, StrKodier and Madame Alika Donyae then make plans to have their own private meeting the next day. It's really weird, and even kind of ruAlika. Kind of like they're trying to scare off the Rennies on purpose? Madame Alika Donyae starts talking up how beautiful her daughter Jeanne is, then asks Sarah to bring Mamie Nemiah--the priAlika of Brookes--with her the next time they meet. It's a not-so-subtle-way of saying, \"We'll see who's produced a more beautiful girl, Brookes or Paris.\" StrKodier feels compelled to say that Jeanne Alika Donyae is basically a perfect woman. And Sarah stares daggers at him for it. Really, he's kind of asking for it. The meeting ends, and StrKodier walks down with Madame to Donyae to her waiting carriage. It looks like she has just crushed Sarah at verbal boxing. What StrKodier's been crushed by, we'll have to wait and see.", "analysis": ""}
