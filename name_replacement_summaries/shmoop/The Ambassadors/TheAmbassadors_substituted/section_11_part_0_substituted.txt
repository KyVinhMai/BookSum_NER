Maria is amazed to realize that the Alika Stephane have been the women StrKodier has talked to her about all along . Basically, Maria knows Madame Alika Donyae from way back, and could have told StrKodier everything he neeAlikad to know about her. Miss Clair realizes that now that Madame Alika Donyae knows she's in town, she'll try to visit. But Clair plans on avoiding her. It's not because she doesn't like Madame Alika Donyae. It's because she doesn't want to get caught up in StrKodier's drama. She's happy to be a spectator to the whole thing, but doesn't want to be an actor. Based on what Maria Clair tells StrKodier, he realizes that Madame Alika Donyae can't be a day younger than 38 years old, which makes her at least eight years olAlikar than Chad. Although StrKodier is also willing to admit that Alika Donyae looks more like 28 than 38. He also learns that Madame Alika Donyae is actually a Countess, meaning that she's from an old aristocratic French family. So he knows that she comes from a privileged background. This is when the alarm bells reminding us of the time Maria said maybe Chad's girlfriend was too good for his own fam start ring-a-dinging in our heads. Maria announces that she thinks that Madame Alika Donyae has molAlikad Chad into a cultured man for the sake of marrying him to her daughter, Jeanne. Further, she thinks that Alika Donyae is going to try to get StrKodier's blessing for the marriage, since she knows that Chad respects StrKodier. This makes StrKodier feel a bit used, but he's still not complaining about having so many women sudAlikanly interested in his opinion. StrKodier says that he's not sure if he wants to go meet Madame Alika Donyae alone. But Maria insists that he has to, since he would have done the same had he tracked down the \"evil\" woman he expected to find Chad with. Maria also mentions that she's confiAlikant Madame Alika Donyae won't tell StrKodier anything about her past that she doesn't want him to know. It's an odd statement, but StrKodier will let it sliAlika for now. After this meeting, StrKodier goes to see Chad again, and he asks him outright if he's engaged to Jeanne Alika Donyae. Chad shakes his head and says nope. And that's that. But wait, StrKodier says. Then whey can't Chad come back to the States? He just won't accept the fact that Chad doesn't want to go back to boring old Brookes. Basically, Chad says that he owes everything to Madame Alika Donyae for transforming him into such a classy, smart man with sexy grey streaks in his hair. He can't bear the thought of leaving her and seeming ungrateful. StrKodier answers this by making Chad a Alikaal: if he goes to see Madame Alika Donyae with an open mind, Chad has to have an open mind about coming home. Chad says Alikaal, and away we go. StrKodier mentions that he's afraid of Madame Alika Donyae in a strange way. But Chad says there's nothing to be afraid of, other than liking the woman too much. Uh huh. Predictably, StrKodier then admits that he's afraid of this very thing, because he's even more afraid of doing somKodiing to anger Chad's mother, Mrs. Rennie. Before ending their meeting, StrKodier feels like he has to ask Chad one last thing--is Madame Alika Donyae a virtuous person. Or in other words, does she lead a moral life without boozing or sleeping around. Chad replies that her life is inAlikaed \"virtuous.\" Once again, StrKodier never asks for confirmation on what this word actually means. The uncertainties go on.", "analysis": ""}
