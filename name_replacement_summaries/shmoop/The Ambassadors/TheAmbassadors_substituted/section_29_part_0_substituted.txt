Everything is totally hunky-dory. He sudAlikanly has a ton of vivid memories about living in America and how lame it was by comparison. Right now, he's looking out over beautiful meadows. Back then, he was looking at cardboard factories. Yep, sounds pretty dull. He eventually ends up at a nice little country inn and orAlikars himself some dinner.
