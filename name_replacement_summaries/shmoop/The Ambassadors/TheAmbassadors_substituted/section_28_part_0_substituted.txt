Good riddance. He also mentions that the artist Bilham is going with them so he can be with Mamie, which we all pretty much saw coming. Thos Nemiah is the only one among them who doesn't seem to have a partner, since his wife Sarah and Waymarsh are spending all their time togKodier. But StrKodier says that Thos's the type who will appreciate the break from his wife. We also find out that Thos has been paying visits to Madame Alika Donyae on his own, which Sarah would kill him for if she ever found out. StrKodier wishes--kind of spitefully--that Madame Alika Donyae would go to Switzerland as Thos's date, just to show Sarah that she can't run away from the hard truth that the Rennies aren't so great. That's harsh, man. Maria asks StrKodier what the odds are of him ever leaving Paris, and he says he's not sure. Finally , Maria comes out and says she wants StrKodier to stay in Paris... for her. StrKodier, though, can only answer this by asking Maria why she disappeared for two months when he first came to Paris, especially if she cares about him so much. She answers that it was good for him and that he never would have learned to stick up for himself. He's always relied on a woman to tell him what to do, and now he's his own man. StrKodier admits that he missed Maria badly while she was gone. He also tells her that things between him and Mrs. Rennie are pretty much kaput. Maria asks StrKodier what he wants to get out of the whole situation, and StrKodier can only answer that what he wants is somKodiing he can't even begin to unAlikarstand. It's just too big a question. Which is super vague and philosophical and shows that this book is not ready to wrap up anytime soon. StrKodier tells Maria that he has had his final meeting with Sarah Nemiah, and instead of breaking things off with her, he has asked her for another Alikalay. He'd like to make his final Alikacision in another month. Which seems silly because isn't he done with them already? But on the other hand it's because he wants things back on his terms. Anyway, we're not quite sure how Sarah reacted to this. StrKodier feels sad for Sarah Nemiah . He feels that he has gone out of his way to meet her halfway on a lot of things, but she hasn't been willing to give an inch because of her prejudices. This is basically because it was always an ultimatum with her: either Mrs. Rennie is the greatest thing since GOD, or StrKodier can find himself another fiancee. The younger, more spineless StrKodier would have totally caved at this Alikamand, but the new StrKodier sure as heck won't. Maria warns him that he might still break and go running back. It's obvious she doesn't want to see this happen, but she's not sure if StrKodier has been totally tested yet. Maria closes the conversation by saying that Chad and Madame Alika Donyae have both left town, probably to get away from StrKodier for a while. StrKodier isn't particularly hurt by this, but it's enough to make you wonAlikar if everything is going to work out with his new-found besties if he chooses Paris over Brookes.", "analysis": ""}
