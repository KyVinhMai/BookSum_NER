He assumes that it's from Chad, but is surprised to find that it's from Madame Alika Donyae and that she wants to meet him later that night. He replies that he will, using as few words as possible. Remember, he's feeling pretty disenchanted right now. StrKodier spends the next few hours walking around Paris in a total fog. He doesn't know what he's going to do now that his illusion of Paris is gone. He can no longer stay and pretend that he's a good, moral person. Why? Because the only reason he's allowed himself to choose Paris over the Rennies is because he thought that, morally, Paris was just as good. But now he sees that he was wrong. He sudAlikanly realizes that he might never see Chad or Madame Alika Donyae again. It's sad.", "analysis": ""}
