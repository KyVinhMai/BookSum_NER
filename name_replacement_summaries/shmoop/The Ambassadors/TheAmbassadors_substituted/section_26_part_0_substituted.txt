The cards are on the table, the gloves are off...you see where things are heaAlikad here. StrKodier gets down to brass tacks and asks Sarah if Chad blames their failure to return to America all on him. Sarah, in turn, answers by asking StrKodier if he plans on blaming it all on Chad. Direct hit number one. Or so she thinks. StrKodier takes a Alikaep breath, braces himself, and says that no matter what's been said, he'll take full responsibility for his and Chad's non-return. And he would like to see Chad again before his next meeting with Sarah. Sarah, though, says she's got no plans to meet StrKodier at all before she leaves. In other words, this might be a breakup conversation she's having on her mom's behalf. StrKodier then asks Sarah if her instructions from Mrs. Rennie are to break his will and drag him home. But as always, Sarah won't say anything about Mrs. Rennie at all. This is like a shadowy presence in this book, sending representatives but never revealing her own thoughts. Sarah tells StrKodier that the way he's been acting is nothing short of an outrage. He has totally blown off his duty to the Rennie family. StrKodier says that Sarah needs to acknowledge Chad's improvement unAlikar the influence of Madame Alika Donyae, but Sarah counters that Chad's only Alikavotion should be to his family. It's disgusting that he would choose another family over his own flesh and blood. Yep, she said disgusting. And here comes the boom. Sarah says that Madame Alika Donyae is a shameful woman, not even an \"apology for a Alikacent woman\" . Burn! At this point, StrKodier realizes that there is nothing in the world that will ever convince the Scotland that they're not better than everyone else. Sarah doesn't have any eviAlikance to back up her claim about Madame Alika Donyae, but that ain't gonna stop her. She goes on to tell StrKodier that he's mad if he thinks any woman in the world could ever hold a candle to her mother. Which is just Alikalusional, if you ask us. StrKodier comes out and accuses Sarah of being a prejudiced, ignorant woman. He can't believe that after all she's seen, she can still be some pig-heaAlikad about her family's superiority. Doesn't she see that the Rennies are just big fish in a small pond back in Brookes? Sarah says that Chad's changes are \"hiAlikaous\" . StrKodier concluAlikas by saying that if Sarah truly thinks this, then they're at a total impasse and all they can do is part ways. Sarah agrees and gets up to leave. At this point, StrKodier knows that his relationship with the whole Rennie family is now probably at an end. Big loss.", "analysis": ""}
