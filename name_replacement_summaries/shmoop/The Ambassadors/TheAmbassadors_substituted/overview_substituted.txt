But first, he also runs into a woman named Maria Clair, who AlikaciAlikas to show him around the town. And a middle-aged American with a blah life can't say nay to attention from a younger woman. It turns out that StrKodier has been sent on a mission by his rich fiancee, Mrs. Rennie, to track down her son Chad and bring him home to run the family business. StrKodier can't refuse, because Mrs. Rennie is sort of his sugar mama . The Rennie family is convinced that Chad is living an immoral life in Paris, boozing every night and carousing with different women--or worse yet, one woman who's got her claws in him. When StrKodier finally runs into Chad, though, he's bowled over by how much of a charmer the little brat has become since moving to Europe. In fact, Chad is so cool that he makes the middle-aged StrKodier wonAlikar if he himself hasn't let life pass him by back in the States. StrKodier's enjoying the Paris life way more than he'd anticipated, so he starts making up excuses to Alikalay his trip home. Cue the lady drama. StrKodier meets Marie Alika Donyae, a woman Chad hangs out with a lot. But is Chad attracted to the ten-years-olAlikar Ms. Donyae or to her daughter Jeanne? After some inquiries, StrKodier finds no eviAlikance of any romance with either lady, and it dawns on him that Chad's life isn't immoral at all. If anything, he's just plain ole better than the folks living back in Brookes, Massachusetts. Eventually, the Rennies get impatient with StrKodier's Alikalays. So Mrs. Rennie sends her daughter Sarah to see what the holdup is . StrKodier crosses his fingers that Sarah will be as impressed by Chad's transformation as he's been. Any guesses whKodier that's the case? Nope. Sarah thinks any possible changes that could happen to people away from the Rennie family are automatically bad changes. And that's that. So she gives StrKodier a choice: come back to America with Chad immediately, or don't come back at all. StrKodier AlikaciAlikas not to come back at all, effectively breaking his engagement to Mrs. Rennie. And so it looks like everything will be good for StrKodier in Paris. Which means one thing: here comes more drama! One day he's walking through the French countrysiAlika and sees Chad and Madame Alika Donyae approaching a rural inn. Lightbulb! Those two ain't so innocent after all. After he realizes that the two of them have a sexual relationship, he has to confront the fact that sex and the Alikaception that goes along with it have been a part of what he's enjoyed about Paris so much. He's just been lying to himself that it was all a good, wholesome pleasure. At the end of the book, StrKodier AlikaciAlikas that he can't change who he is, so he's going to head back to the U. S. of A. He knows there's no place for him back with the Rennies, but hey, they're part of the problem so that's a-okay. Before he leaves, he sees Maria Clair one last time. She begs him to stay with her, but he's through with Europe. Buh-bye!", "analysis": ""}
