{"name": "Act 1, Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210615141326/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/measure-for-measure/summary/act-1-scene-1", "summary": "At his palace in Vienna, Duke Vincentio makes a big speech about how a lord in his court, Escalus, is the wisest and most knowledgeable guy in Vienna--he knows more about Vienna's laws and people than anybody else. The Duke tells Escalus that he's going out of town. While he's away, Angelo will be in charge. Escalus thinks if anyone is up for representing the Duke in his absence, it's Angelo. When Angelo comes in, the Duke gives him the news. He also says that while he is gone, Angelo should make sure the people of Vienna don't step out of line. If they do, he has full authority to punish them according to the law . Escalus, an old lord, will be second in command because he's so wise and knows so much about Vienna's laws and its people. Angelo goes through an \"aw, shucks\" routine and says he hasn't demonstrated that he's worthy enough to fill in for the Duke. \"Nonsense,\" says the Duke, who announces rather cryptically that he has to go somewhere immediately and that he'll be in touch soon. Before he leaves, the Duke reminds Angelo that while he is away, Angelo is his substitute and has full authority to enforce the laws or to bend the rules of justice as he sees fit. Yeah, yeah. We heard you the first time. He also adds that, even though he loves his people, he's not big on public appearances, especially since people are always cheering for him like he's a rock star. History Snack: Some literary critics think the Duke's whole \"I really don't like the limelight\" speech is a reference to King James I, who, unlike his predecessor Queen Elizabeth I, wasn't a huge fan of being in the public spotlight all the time. The Duke exits and Escalus and Angelo make plans to talk so they can work out the details of their new jobs.", "analysis": ""}
