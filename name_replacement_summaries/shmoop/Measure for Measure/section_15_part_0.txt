Isabella reveals that the Friar has advised her to accuse Angelo of sleeping with her. Even though she knows it's a lie , she's willing to go along with the scheme. We also learn that Isabella has been told she shouldn't worry if the Friar pretends like he's not on her side. It's all part of the plan.
