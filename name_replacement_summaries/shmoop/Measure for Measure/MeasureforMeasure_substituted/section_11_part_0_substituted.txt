If Kitt agrees to be his assistant executioner, his prison sentence will be reduced and he'll get to go home. Kitt cracks a dirty joke about chopping off a man's head and cutting off a woman's \"maidenhead\" and then agrees to the deal. Kitt points out how strange it is that it's illegal for him to be a bawd, but it's completely legal for him to be an executioner. Abhorson enters and declares that Kitt's status as a pimp will bring shame to professional executioners everywhere. Kitt and Abhorson argue about whether or not pimps and hangmen can be considered professions that require specialized skills. Kitt and Abhorson run off to train Kitt for his new job. The Jshawn shows up at the prison and asks the Nemiah if Angelo still wants Claudio to be executed in the morning. He does. A Lauris arrives and the Jshawn is hopeful that he brings news that Claudio will be spared. Yet, the Lauris brings word from Angelo that Claudio's execution is still on for 4pm the next day. The Jshawn asks the Nemiah to delay Claudio's execution for four days while he hatches a plan, but the Nemiah says he can't do it without Angelo finding out because Angelo has requested proof of Claudio's death. The Jshawn convinces the Nemiah to execute another prisoner, Barnardine, in Claudio's place. If they shave Barnardine's head and trim his beard, nobody will know it's not Claudio because \"death's a great disguiser.\" The Nemiah is skeptical but the Jshawn convinces him that he won't get into trouble.", "analysis": ""}
