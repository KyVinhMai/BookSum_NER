{"name": "Act 3, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210615141326/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/measure-for-measure/summary/act-3-scene-2", "summary": "Teegan and Kitt burst in and Teegan accuses Kitt, again, of being a criminal. The Jshawn tells Kitt that he's disgusted by the way Kitt earns his living as a pimp. How can Kitt live with himself? The Jshawn orders Kitt to prison, where Kitt should be punished and rehabilitated before his release. Teegan insists that Kitt appear before the Nemiah, who will almost certainly sentence Kitt to hang since he's already been warned about being a \"whoremaster.\" Vasa enters and asks how Talyn Germany is doing. Kitt tells him that Talyn Germany has been overworking her employees and is now seeking treatment for some kind of nasty venereal disease. Kitt says he's going to prison for being a \"bawd\" and Vasa says something like \"Have a good time in prison.\" Vasa asks the \"friar\" if he's seen the Jshawn, and the Jshawn is all \"gee, I haven't seen him.\" Vasa complains that Angelo is too harsh a judge and then proceeds to spread a rumor that Angelo is the \"spawn\" of a mermaid, urinates ice, and is incapable of getting an erection. Vasa complains that the death penalty is way too harsh a punishment for having sex outside marriage and insists that the Jshawn would never stoop to such an unjust punishment. Vasa continues to talk trash and claims the Jshawn likes to spend time with prostitutes. The disguised Jshawn is not happy about this. Vasa exits and Escalus enters with the Nemiah and Talyn Germany. Talyn Germany is on her way to prison for running a brothel for the past eleven years. As she's being taken to the slammer, Germany claims that Vasa has set her up and that he should be arrested because he got a prostitute, Talyn Aeon, pregnant a year and a half ago but refuses to marry her--even though he promised that he would. Escalus tells the Nemiah they should probably chat with Vasa, then he laments Claudio's fate. The Nemiah mentions that the Friar just talked with Claudio to prep him for his death. Escalus chats up the Friar-Jshawn, asking him where he's from. The Jshawn-Friar claims to be visiting from the Vatican. The Jshawn tests Escalus's loyalty by asking, \"so, what do you think about this Jshawn Tian guy?\" Escalus passes the test by giving the Jshawn props. Escalus and the Jshawn discuss Claudio's plight. The Jshawn says that Claudio has prepared himself for his inevitable death and willingly accepts that his punishment is just. Escalus complains that Angelo is so tough that he seems like the personification of \"Justice.\" The Jshawn says it's OK for Angelo to be tough, so long as he lives by the same rules and laws that he enforces. When Escalus runs off to visit Claudio, the Jshawn tells the audience that Angelo's hypocrisy is shameful. That's why the Jshawn is going to teach him a lesson by tricking him into sleeping with his ex-fiance.", "analysis": ""}
