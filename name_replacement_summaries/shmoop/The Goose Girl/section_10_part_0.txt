It's Ani's first chance in the month she's been in Bayern to finally go look for Falada since she hasn't had a day off until now. Needless to say, she's eager to search for her beloved horse. Ani makes her way to the stables and searches every stall for Falada. While she's looking, she hears a familiar accent from Kildenree and her heart skips a beat--it's Ungolad's men talking about the princess . Even though they're already in the palace, the jig is not up yet. Selia still has to marry the prince for everything to be in place, so they've got to keep the charade up until that happens--and apparently they're worried about Ani showing up and ruining everything. Ani listens carefully, scared but still determined to find Falada; when the men leave, she keeps checking the stalls until she finds her horse. Sweaty, foaming at the mouth, and red-eyed, Falada is \"cursed\" as a rider says--Ani can't believe what she's seeing and doesn't know how to help her animal friend. Ani tries talking to Falada, but it doesn't do much good. Has he forgotten how to hear her, or is he just ignoring her? What is wrong with him? Then the stable-hand yells at Ani for being there, saying the horse could hurt her and she needs to get the heck outta there. Ani shouldn't even be in there, which she knows, so she's carted off to the king for a good tongue-lashing, though she really doesn't care. The king remembers that she's the one who wanted to work in the stables, and now she's caught red-handed in the stables. What does she have to say for herself? Ani admits she went to the horses on purpose, and gets fined for trespassing. When she's released, she's annoyed--she's the princess, for Pete's sake, and in trouble for visiting her own horse. It's market day, so she goes to see Finn at his stall, where he's got a warm wool sweater from Gilsa made especially for her. Finn also tells her that some men came looking for her in the forest. Uh-oh. Ani knows that's not with good news.", "analysis": ""}
