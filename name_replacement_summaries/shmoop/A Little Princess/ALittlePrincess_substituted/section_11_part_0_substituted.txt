She becomes fond of him even though she doesn't know him and figures out that he's actually an Englishman who had lived in India and went through a series of unfortunate events... having to do with some diamond mines. She tries to send good vibes his way because he seems so sick and unhappy. The Large Family goes to visit the Indian gentleman and they find that the man has been looking for a certain child. He's convinced that this child is in Paris because her mother was French and her father was... dun, dun, dun, the one and only Ralph Clair. That's right, ladies and gentleman, he's looking for Sara Clair! He wants to find Sara and give her a fortune when he finds her because he was Ralph Clair's business partner. Carmichael assures Carrisford that they'll find the girl and that he himself will go to Paris to search for her. At the same time Sara is on the other side of the wall talking to Shondell, completely unaware that there's a freaking search party for her next door.", "analysis": ""}
