She's watching the sun set one day when she sees a Lascar with a monkey climb out onto the roof. They smile at each other. The monkey suddenly breaks loose and runs over to Sara's roof, where it lands on her shoulder and scurries into her attic room. Sara volunteers to help--in Hindustani. The manservant is delighted and tells her that the monkey is disobedient. The manservant's name is Ram Dass, and he works for the man next door. Ram Dass comes over to Sara's attic, catches the monkey, and leaves. Sara is a little embarrassed about how bare and sad her room is, and she thinks about how Miss Minchin will make her stay at the school as a servant forever. The only thing she can do is be princess-like even when she's in rags, because it is that much more of a triumph . She is exceptionally polite to all the servants even when they're awful to her. The next day, she is in the classroom and she suddenly starts laughing. No, there's no joke: she's just thinking about how Miss Minchin would feel if she suddenly found out that Sara was actually a princess. When Miss Minchin demands to know why she's laughing, she tells the truth. Not a good move. Miss Minchin orders her out of the room.", "analysis": ""}
