Sara tries to keep them warm by telling stories of warm places, but, you know, it's just not the same as a nice toasty fire. While running an errand on a cold, wet day, Sara thinks how nice it would be to find some money, buy some hot buns, and eat them all without stopping. Lo and behold--she finds a fourpenny piece! She's off to find delicious food to stuff into her mouth, but before she gets to the bakery she sees a little street beggar who tells her that she hasn't had food in days. Sara goes inside to buy four buns with her fourpenny piece, but the woman gives her six because she looks so hungry. Outside, Sara gives the beggar child five of the buns, keeping only one for herself. The baker woman comes out and asks the beggar child how many buns Sara gave her, and she can't believe that Sara gave away so many. She tells the beggar child to come indoors and warm herself up, and that she'll give her food, too. That's our Sara, spreading the love. Sara eats tiny pieces of her last bun as she's walking back. As she walks back, the Large Family is saying goodbye to their father and they tell him to find the little girl. Sara wonders who they're looking for. Oh, the irony!", "analysis": ""}
