Sara smiles at the person, who runs away. Later that day, she sees the same girl enter the room as she's telling stories to the other pupils about mermaids. Lavinia points out snottily that the girl has been listening, and the girl runs away. When Sara is annoyed, Lavinia says that it's unseemly to tell stories to servant girls. When Sara gets back to her room, she asks Mariette who the girl is. It turns out she's a scullery maid who does all sorts of nasty chores for the household. A few weeks later, Sara comes into her room to see Becky asleep on the chair. She lets her sleep for a while, but Becky wakes up and is totally horrified. Sara assures her that it's okay and even invites her to sit down and have a slice of cake. Then she says that Becky can listen to her stories any time she wants to. Is your heart warmed yet?", "analysis": ""}
