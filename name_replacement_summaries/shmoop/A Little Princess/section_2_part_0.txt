She's not super smart, poor thing, and is blown away by Sara's ability to learn French. Miss Minchin isn't very nice to Ermengarde, and because of this, Sara feels the need to reach out to her. After lessons, Sara introduces herself. Ermengarde goes on about how clever Sara must be because she can speak French. Sara does what any child would upon making a friend --she asks Ermengarde if she'd like to meet Emily, her doll. When she starts to tell fantastical stories about Emily, Ermengarde is amazed at how she's able to just make things up on the fly. Suddenly, Sara looks like she's in pain. Ermengarde asks her what is up with that, and Sara responds that she's in pain because she misses her father. Then, Ermengarde asks Sara if she'd like to be her best friend. Which is not weird at all. Sara agrees. Yay, BFF!", "analysis": ""}
