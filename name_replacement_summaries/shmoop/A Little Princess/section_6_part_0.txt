Duh, to watch, not to actually participate. Miss Minchin gives a big, fake speech about \"dear Sara\" and thanks her for coming to the school. Then Sara gets her last doll with a trunkful of fancy clothes for it. However, at the same time, disaster is a'brewing. Captain Crewe's solicitor comes and demands to talk to Miss Minchin. He says that Captain Crewe is dead and that there were no diamonds in the diamond mines--so now \"dear Sara\" is both penniless AND an orphan. Sara's big party isn't being paid for and Miss Minchin is going to have to take care of her... forever. Of course she's furious. Miss Minchin tells Miss Amelia, who starts to cry. Becky turns out to be in the room and she starts to cry too. Miss Minchin calls Sara in and tells her that her papa is dead, and she'll have to make herself useful around the school. Wow, not much compassion here. Sara won't be able to keep playing with her dolls or keep all her fancy things. And? She's also going to start sleeping in the attic room next to Becky's. Sara is remarkably calm for a child who's just had her entire world taken away. She trudges up to the attic and lies down in the dingy little room. Then Becky comes in and they both cry together.", "analysis": ""}
