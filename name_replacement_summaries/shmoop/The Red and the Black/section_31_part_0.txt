The man is so polite and courteous that Julien is caught off guard. After the meeting, Julien goes to a tailor to get some new clothes. Julien's first tasks for the marquis don't go well, since he doesn't spell very well. He's more of an oral learner. Julien also makes the blunder of not being properly dressed for certain hours of the day. He later meets the Marquis' wife, who barely looks at him. The Marquis' son, Count Norbert, seems like a nice enough guy. At dinner, Julien is able to win much of the family over with his knowledge of old books. Even The Marquis' wife gives him the benefit of the doubt, since he seems to amuse her husband.", "analysis": ""}
