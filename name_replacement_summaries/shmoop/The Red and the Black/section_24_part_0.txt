The man takes Julien into an inner room to a man who's writing at a desk. The man at the desk eventually looks up. This is Father Pirard, one of the dudes who'll now be in charge of Julien. The guy practically interrogates Julien and makes him super nervous. He also lays out all the strict rules of the seminary. It turns out that Father Chelan from Verrieres has asked for Julien to have a scholarship into the seminary. Pirard respects the man a lot, so he agrees, although he's not sure whether Julien is totally sincere about entering the priesthood. And he's right to be suspicious. The man is impressed and pleased that Julien speaks fluent Latin. Pirard is also pleased that Julien seems to know his theology pretty well. When asked about how much money he has brought to the seminary, Julien lies. He doesn't want the priests to know in case he goes out some night and drops a bunch of money at a bar. Father Pirard shows Julien to his room.", "analysis": ""}
