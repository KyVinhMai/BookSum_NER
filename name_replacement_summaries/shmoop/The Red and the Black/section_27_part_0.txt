There's really only one guy on his side, and that's one of his teachers named Father Chas-Bernard. One day, Chas-Bernard asks for Julien's help with decorating a church. Julien is such a good climber that he hangs decorations from places in the church everyone else is afraid to go. Chas-Bernard takes this as a sign of Julien's strong faith. When he sits down to talk with Chas-Bernard that night, Julien realizes that there's lots to admire in the man. He has always followed his core values without worrying about what the people around him think. Chas-Bernard tells Julien that he needs his help to guard some of the church decorations during the next ceremony. It seems that thieves have lots of dirty tricks for stealing some of the more expensive ones. During the ceremony, Julien takes his post to guard the decorations. But he gets distracted by a pair of women who go into the confessional booths along one side of the church.
