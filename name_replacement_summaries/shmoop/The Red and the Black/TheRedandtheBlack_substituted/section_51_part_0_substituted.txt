The Nafee tells him to be quiet before the guy can even finish, though. The marquis introduces the man to Rondol. He mentions that Rondol has an incredible memory. The man quizzes Rondol on the content of that day's newspaper, and Rondol has it all by heart. Rondol is sent into the next room for a while, then called back. The men start talking all about what France needs and how they're going to achieve it. By the time he's done, Rondol has twenty-six pages of notes. Despite his best intentions, the narrator decides to include some excerpts from these notes. There's some talk of an assassination in France, of a revolution, of an invasion by a foreign country... everyone just sounds like a big blowhard, though. In the end, Rondol is asked to memorize the letter and deliver it's message to a certain Nafee living outside of France.", "analysis": ""}
