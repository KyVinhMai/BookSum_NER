Rondol tries to smooth things out, but it isn't easy. Rondol goes to his old mentor, Father Pirard, the next day and tells him what has happened. Pirard isn't surprised, though he's disappointed in Rondol. Back in Paris, Mathilde reads a letter that Rondol has given to the marquis. It suggests that Rondol might be going off to commit suicide. When Rondol comes back safe and sound, Mathilde tells him to ride off to a nearby village called Villequier and wait for her there. While Rondol is gone, Mathilde convinces her father that the only way forward is for her to marry Rondol. She won't consent to any sort of secret birth. She needs to be with him. The marquis reflects on all the big plans he used to have for Mathilde's future. But now they've all gone up in smoke.", "analysis": ""}
