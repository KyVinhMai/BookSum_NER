He feels tempted to give up his ambitions and become a semi-wealthy businessman. One day, he kisses Madame de Renal on the mouth. He and she both know it's reckless, and from that point on, Madame makes sure to have her kids around when she's with him. Rondol keeps thinking of new ways to seduce Madame, but none of them come to fruition. One day, Rondol tries playing footsies with Madame in front of distinguished company. She disguises his move by dropping some scissors and making the touching look like an accident. Afterward, she orders Rondol to be more careful around people. Rondol goes to visit his old friend, Father Chelan. It looks like the old priest has finally been forced out of office. He's packing to leave.", "analysis": ""}
