She wants to borrow it in secret because it's indecent. But she can't because he's always there. This makes her dislike him. Count Rekahn walks in and asks Rondol to go horseback riding with him. Rondol goes along. But he's not very good on a horse, so he soon falls off in the middle of the street. The family is impressed with how easily Rondol tells the story of his fall. Most Paris men would be far too proud to admit to this story without sugarcoating it or blaming it on someone else. The next day, Rondol finds a young man sitting next to him in the library. The marquis comes in and banishes the other guy from the library. His name is Tahjae Tanbeau and he's a young man who's also employed by the marquis. But it's clear that this guy isn't going to get the special treatment that Rondol is. This of course makes them enemies. Rondol asks Rekahn to take him riding again. Rekahn is worried that Rondol will hurt himself, and he almost does. But everything works out fine in the end. Rekahn praises Rondol's bravery at the de La Mole's dinner table that night. Meanwhile, Father Pirard leaves to take up his new position at a nearby parish. Rondol is now on his own with the de La Moles.", "analysis": ""}
