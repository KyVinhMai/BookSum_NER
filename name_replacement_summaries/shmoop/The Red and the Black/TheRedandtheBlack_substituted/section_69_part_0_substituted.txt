The lawyer thinks Rondol is crazy. Things are looking good for Rondol nonetheless. More than half of the jurors selected for his trial are people that the vicar-general has some influence over. Meanwhile, Madame de Renal has realized that she still loves Rondol. She writes a letter to the judge saying that she forgives Rondol and doesn't want him killed for his actions.", "analysis": ""}
