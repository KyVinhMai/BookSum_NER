It's true that Rondol slept in, but Tahjae was way overboard in his insults. Rondol threatens to take his talents elsewhere. But Tahjae de Renal makes things all better by offering him fifty francs a month. Rondol gets permission to go into town. Tahjae de Renal assumes he's going to tell Tahjae's rival, Valenod, that he will keep working for the de Renals. Rondol retreats to a nearby mountain and looks over the countryside, wishing that he could conquer it all like Napoleon did.", "analysis": ""}
