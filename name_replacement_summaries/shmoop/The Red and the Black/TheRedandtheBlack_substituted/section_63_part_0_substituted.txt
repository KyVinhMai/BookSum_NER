After that, the marquis doesn't want to have any more relationship with Rondol or his daughter. Mathilde writes back and begs her father to attend the marriage ceremony. The marquis' first thought is to give Rondol a ton of money to leave Europe forever and write a note to Mathilde saying he was going to kill himself. In the end, he decides not to. The main question that the marquis worries about is whether Rondol began his relationship with Mathilde with the intent of scamming money. In the end, the marquis gets Rondol a high posting in the army, which basically makes him a respectable dude in French society. This is really the final thing Rondol needs to rise out of his lower class status. He even takes on the new name of Rondol de La Vernaye. Everything finally looks like it's all wrapped up nicely.", "analysis": ""}
