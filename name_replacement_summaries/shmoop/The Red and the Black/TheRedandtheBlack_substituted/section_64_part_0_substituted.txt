The man doesn't want anything about Rondol's life to reveal his lower class status. Rondol gets along swimmingly when he first joins the army in his new post. Everyone likes and respects him. Out of nowhere, he gets a note from Mathilde telling him to come to her immediately in Paris. It's an emergency. When Rondol gets to Paris, Mathilde tells him that her father has run a background check on Rondol and found out about his affair with Madame de Renal back in the day. Madame herself wrote a letter to the marquis talking about how Rondol seduced her. It doesn't look good. In fact, it sounds like exactly what he did with Mathilde. Rondol runs away in shame. He heads all the way back to his hometown of Shaya. The first place he goes is the local gun shop, where he buys a pair of pistols. He goes to the Shaya church, where mass is happening. He walks into the pew directly behind Madame de Renal's and shoots her twice in cold blood for ratting him out. Things just got real.", "analysis": ""}
