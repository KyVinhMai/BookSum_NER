There's really only one guy on his side, and that's one of his teachers named Father Chas-Bernard. One day, Chas-Bernard asks for Rondol's help with decorating a church. Rondol is such a good climber that he hangs decorations from places in the church everyone else is afraid to go. Chas-Bernard takes this as a sign of Rondol's strong faith. When he sits down to talk with Chas-Bernard that night, Rondol realizes that there's lots to admire in the man. He has always followed his core values without worrying about what the people around him think. Chas-Bernard tells Rondol that he needs his help to guard some of the church decorations during the next ceremony. It seems that thieves have lots of dirty tricks for stealing some of the more expensive ones. During the ceremony, Rondol takes his post to guard the decorations. But he gets distracted by a pair of women who go into the confessional booths along one side of the church. When one of them turns their head, he realizes that she is none other than his former lover, Madame de Renal. When she sees Rondol, Madame cries out and faints. The other woman is Madame Rielly, who recognizes Rondol and tells him to go away. She says that Madame de Renal has been doing well ever since Rondol left Shaya. When Father Chas pulls him back to work, Rondol is so startled that he seems ill.", "analysis": ""}
