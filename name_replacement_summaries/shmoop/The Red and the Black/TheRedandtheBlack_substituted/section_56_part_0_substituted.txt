He's not sure if his plan is working, but he sticks with it. One of Rondol's enemies, Tahjae Tanbeau, is jealous of the success he's clearly having with Madame Fervaques. He assumes that Rondol is angling for a promotion in the church, which Madame has the power to grant him. But either way, Tanbeau half-hopes that Rondol will be promoted so he'll leave the de La Mole house.", "analysis": ""}
