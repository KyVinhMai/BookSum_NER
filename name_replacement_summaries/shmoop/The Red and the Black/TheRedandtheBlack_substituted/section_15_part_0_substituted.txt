Madame starts to worry that he's not looking at her because he's no longer interested. Madame de Renal's cousin Amel Rielly sees that something is going on between them and makes sure to always get between them while they're hanging out that day. The next night at 1 a.m., Rondol sneaks back into Madame's room for more sex. Rondol becomes comfortable with talking to Madame about his doubts and anxieties. It only brings them closer together. Madame often thinks that she should have married a man more like Rondol, with a poetic soul. Madame Rielly becomes fed up with her cousin's foolish flirtations with Rondol. She leaves one day without any explanation. Madame de Renal isn't sad to see her go. Now she gets to be alone with Rondol all the time.", "analysis": ""}
