Every single one of them seems to have a different vision for what France should be like. When Rondol and the Marquis de La Mole leave the meeting at three a.m., the marquis is embarrassed by how foolish some of the \"great\" men of France sounded at the meeting. He makes Rondol promise never to breathe a word about the meeting to anyone. The next day, Rondol is given a fake passport and pushed into a carriage. Rondol gets stopped quickly on his trip, since there are apparently no horses available at his next stop. Rondol thinks that something about the situation doesn't smell right. Rondol meets up with an Italian singer who tells him that the whole horse situation is bogus. The man from their inn sent his horses across town to make it look like he doesn't have any. It's clear that someone knows about Rondol. Rondol is wakened from his sleep that night by two men rummaging through his room. They're looking for a letter, but little do they know that what they're looking for exists only inside Rondol's head. Rondol grips his pistols and wants to kill them, but just waits until they leave. Rondol continues on his journey and meets up with the Nafee whom he's supposed to deliver the \"letter\" in his head to. After the duke listens to his message, he tells Rondol to take the next train out of town and to return on the twenty-second of the month and meet the duke in a special cafe.", "analysis": ""}
