But no matter what she does for him, all he can feel toward her is indifference. It sounds like he's really checked out from the hotel of life. The next time Mathilde visits him, Rondol says that he would like Madame de Renal to look after their child growing up. You can imagine how this goes over with Mathilde. Rondol tries to cheer Mathilde up by saying that she still has time to hide her scandal and to marry a successful young man in Paris.", "analysis": ""}
