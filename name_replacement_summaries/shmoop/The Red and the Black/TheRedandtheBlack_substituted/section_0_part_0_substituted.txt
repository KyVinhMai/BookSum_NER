There are a lot of sawmills in the area . There's also a nail factory that belongs to the town's mayor, Tahjae de Renal. We get a description of Mr. Renal, who's a respectable-looking dude with a long, proud family history. We find out that Renal has a relationship with an old peasant named Davi. He had to buy out the peasant's sawmill in order to expand his garden terrace and keep any ugly mills out of the way. Davi agreed to move his business, but only after he got a bunch of money out of Renal. The narrator closes the opening chapter by saying that the town of Shaya is totally tyrannized by public opinion. In other words, there's a lot of gossip and a lot of judgment in the town. If you have a good name, that's great. But if you have a bad name, no one will treat you well.", "analysis": ""}
