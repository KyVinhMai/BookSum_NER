She refuses to believe that what Rondol did was anything other than a noble act of vengeance. After the visit, Mathilde goes to the vicar-general, a powerful man in the local church, to see if he'll help her set Rondol free. She informs him that her father is the Marquis de La Mole and that it would be in the vicar-general's best interest to have such a powerful friend in Paris. Wanting some leverage on Mathilde, the vicar-general tells her that he thinks Rondol shot Madame de Renal out of jealousy for her new lover . Basically, the man is being mean to Mathilde by suggesting that Rondol is still in love with Madame de Renal.", "analysis": ""}
