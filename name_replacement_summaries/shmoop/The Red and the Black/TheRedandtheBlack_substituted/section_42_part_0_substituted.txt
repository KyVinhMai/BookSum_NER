They fall silent, and he wonders for a moment if they're conspiring to make fun of him. While doing some business for the Marquis de La Mole, Rondol realizes that some of the man's private books are going missing. The books are especially racy, and Rondol knows it's not Rekahn who's taking them. It must be Mathilde. Rondol learns that he'll have to make a trip to a place called Languedoc. He smiles to think that while he's gone, he'll know that he is first in Mathilde's heart. One night while walking, Mathilde grips him by the arm and tells him to expect a letter from her that night. An hour later, Rondol receives a letter that plainly declares Mathilde's love for him. He decides to put off his trip to Languedoc. He revels in the fact that he, such a poor young man, has bested all the richest noblemen in Paris. Rondol worries that he might be walking into a trap if he tries to visit Mathilde. After all, he has been shot at before for visiting a woman's bedroom. So he decides to send his letter from Mathilde to his buddy Soua for safekeeping, just in case something happens to him.", "analysis": ""}
