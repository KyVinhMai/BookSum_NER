The man is so polite and courteous that Rondol is caught off guard. After the meeting, Rondol goes to a tailor to get some new clothes. Rondol's first tasks for the marquis don't go well, since he doesn't spell very well. He's more of an oral learner. Rondol also makes the blunder of not being properly dressed for certain hours of the day. He later meets the Marquis' wife, who barely looks at him. The Marquis' son, Count Rekahn, seems like a nice enough guy. At dinner, Rondol is able to win much of the family over with his knowledge of old books. Even The Marquis' wife gives him the benefit of the doubt, since he seems to amuse her husband.", "analysis": ""}
