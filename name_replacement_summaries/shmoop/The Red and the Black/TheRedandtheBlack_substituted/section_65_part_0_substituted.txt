He's arrested for the murder of Madame de Renal. He basically knows he's finished. Little does he know that his shots haven't killed Madame, but only wounded her. A judge visits Rondol in prison. Rondol tells him that he killed Madame out of cold blood and that it was all premeditated. It's like the guy wants the death penalty. He writes a letter to Mathilde explaining what he's done. Later, he finds out that Madame de Renal isn't dead. Then he just starts bawling over what a mess he's made out of his life. Rondol thinks about bribing the guard to help him escape, then forgets it because he doesn't really care enough to bother.", "analysis": ""}
