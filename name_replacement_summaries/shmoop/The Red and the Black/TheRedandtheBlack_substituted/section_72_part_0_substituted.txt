Madame de Renal is standing over him. She begs him to appeal his conviction. Rondol realizes how much he still loves Madame. He agrees to appeal as long as she comes to visit him every day. It turns out that the letter Madame de Renal sent the Marquis de La Mole about her affair with Rondol wasn't actually written by her. A young priest wrote it and made her copy it in her own hand. Madame offers to kill herself if this will make Rondol happy. He says he'll only appeal his sentence if she promises not to do this.", "analysis": ""}
