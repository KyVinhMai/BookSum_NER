On the coach, he listens to two guys talk about how great Napoleon Bonaparte was and he smiles to himself. When he arrives in Paris, he spends an evening seeing some of the sights before heading to where he was instructed. He meets Father Pirard, who tells him that he'll head back to the seminary if he doesn't make himself useful. Pirard also warns him that people in the house, especially de La Mole's son, will act snooty toward him at first. Julien thanks Pirard for his help.", "analysis": ""}
