The first thing he does there is go into a cafe because he likes the feeling of being a solitary, handsome traveller in a strange new place. When he reaches the cafe, he strikes up a conversation with a waitress and flirts with her. Soon enough, one of the waitress' boyfriends shows up and starts giving him a mean stare. He decides he wants to fight a duel with the guy, but the waitress stops him. She writes her name on a card for him and tells him to come ask for her later, saying that he's her cousin from away. Julien leaves thinking he's scored a romantic victory. Before going to the seminary, Julien asks an older woman to watch his clothes for him. He wants access to them in case he goes back to meet the girl from the cafe.", "analysis": ""}
