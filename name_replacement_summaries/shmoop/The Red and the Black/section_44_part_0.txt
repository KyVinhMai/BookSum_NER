On the one hand, it's probably a trap. On the other, he'll never have a chance to be with such a beautiful, rich young woman again. He decides to visit Mathilde, but to keep two loaded pistols in his pockets just in case. Then he sends a copy of Mathilde's letter to Fouqe. He spends the rest of the evening looking for some clue of knowledge in the faces of the servants in the house. He can't help but feel that there's a conspiracy against him. Why else would a girl like Mathilde ask him to her room in the middle of the night?", "analysis": ""}
