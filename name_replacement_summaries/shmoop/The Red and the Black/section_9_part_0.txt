It's true that Julien slept in, but Monsieur was way overboard in his insults. Julien threatens to take his talents elsewhere. But Monsieur de Renal makes things all better by offering him fifty francs a month. Julien gets permission to go into town. Monsieur de Renal assumes he's going to tell Monsieur's rival, Valenod, that he will keep working for the de Renals. Julien retreats to a nearby mountain and looks over the countryside, wishing that he could conquer it all like Napoleon did.", "analysis": ""}
