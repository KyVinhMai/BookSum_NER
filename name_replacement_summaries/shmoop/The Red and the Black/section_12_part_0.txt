He learns a lot about the world of relationships. Back at the de Renal house, Madame de Renal has literally gotten sick with grief during Julien's absence. Her cousin, Madame Derville, realizes what's up and laments that fact that her cousin has fallen in love with a poor servant. When Julien gets back, he goes to hold Madame de Renal's hand in the garden and realizes that he wants to become her lover. It's not because he loves her, really. It's because this is what he's supposed to do if he's going to be a heroic character. Julien whispers to Madame de Renal that he must leave forever because he's madly in love with her. This almost makes her heart explode.", "analysis": ""}
