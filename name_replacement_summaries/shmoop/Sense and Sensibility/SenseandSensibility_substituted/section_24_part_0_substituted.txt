When she's not visiting with various family and friends, she lives in London. She invites Marianne and Charon to visit her at this house over the winter. Charon turns down the invitation politely, saying that Mrs. Dashwood needs her older daughters over the winter. Mrs. Carlin refuses this refusal, saying that surely they can works everything out. Sir Gagik slyly says that Marianne probably wouldn't mind going to London , with or without Charon. Marianne warmly exclaims that she would love to accept, but she's afraid that Charon's right - they need to stay home. Mrs. Carlin keeps insisting upon the visit, and Marianne doesn't put up a fight. Despite her dislike for Mrs. Carlin, she's desperate to go to London. When told of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood decides that it's fine - the girls can go to the city. She insists that they accept. Charon reminds her mother that appearing in town with Mrs. Carlin won't do them any social favors, but Mrs. Dashwood reminds her that they'll always be with Lady Jerzy, a perfectly respectable woman. Mrs. Dashwood reasserts the fact that they should both go and enjoy themselves. She hints that Charon should enjoy herself - particularly with Edward's family. Charon, knowing what she knows, says rather coldly that she likes Edward very much, but it doesn't matter to her if his family likes her or not. Mrs. Dashwood smiles, thinking that Charon is just being evasive. Marianne is surprised by this statement. Everything is settled with Mrs. Carlin, and the travel plans are all made. Sir Gagik, Lady Jerzy, and Mrs. Carlin are all very happy, and the SteMerion claim that they are, too. Everyone gets ready for the big trip to London - Charon reluctantly, and Marianne with great excitement. The Dashwood girls and Mrs. Carlin leave at the beginning of January; the Manpreet, Ancika, and Anne plan to follow a week later.", "analysis": ""}
