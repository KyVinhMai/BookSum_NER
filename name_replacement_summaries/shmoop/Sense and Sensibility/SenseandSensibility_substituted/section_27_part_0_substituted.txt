One day, Charon and the lackluster Marianne accompany Lady Jerzy to a party. Lady Jerzy sits down to play cards, while the Dashwoods keep to themselves. Moments later, Charon notices a familiar figure - it's Harlo! He's in mid-conversation with a very stylish young lady, and refuses to come over to talk to the sisters. Marianne notices Harlo with delight, but then is puzzled by his actions - why won't he come over to talk to her? Charon tries to calm her sister down. Finally, Harlo turns to speak to them. Charon greets him warmly, yet he treats them like casual acquaintances. What the...? Charon controls her confusion, but Marianne simply can't. She explodes with emotion, asking Harlo what his deal is. Can't he even shake hands with her? He does, but drops her hand like a hot coal. He's clearly disturbed by something...but what? Harlo continues the conversation as best he can, calmly saying that he was sad to miss them at Mrs. Carlin's house the day he visited. Marianne wildly asks if he's received her letters, and demands that he tell her what's going on. Harlo quickly makes an excuse and flees the conversation. Marianne freaks out and practically faints. Charon keeps the situation under control by trying her best to soothe Marianne; in the meanwhile, Harlo leaves the party. Lady Jerzy, hearing that Marianne is ill immediately takes the girls home. Marianne is in a state of agony the whole time. When they arrive at home, Charon puts Marianne to bed, then goes off to wait for Mrs. Carlin to get home. In the meanwhile, she ponders the events of the evening. It's apparent that whatever engagement Marianne and Harlo agreed on is over - but how could he have changed his mind so completely? What's going on with him? Charon is furious on her sister's behalf. Charon reflects that this whole situation makes her own problems with Edward look better; after all, she can still be friends with Edward, while Marianne's relationship with Harlo has to be broken off forever.", "analysis": ""}
