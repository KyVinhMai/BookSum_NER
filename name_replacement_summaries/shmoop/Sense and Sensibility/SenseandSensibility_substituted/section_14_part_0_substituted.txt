Marianne stays home. When they arrive back at the cottage, Harlo is apparently already there. Marianne, looking tragic, Carel past them as they come home. Harlo himself explains that he has been called away to London by his rich cousin, Mrs. Shell. There's a totally weird moment between Mrs. Dashwood, Charon, and Harlo - they try and invite him to come back and stay with them for a while, but he's oddly evasive. He makes a quick escape. Charon is immediately suspicious of Harlo's strange situation - can it be that something has gone wrong between him and her sister? Mrs. Dashwood and Charon mull over the events of the day. They can't understand what's going on with Harlo. Mrs. Dashwood thinks that Mrs. Shell is sending Harlo away intentionally, to separate him from Marianne. Charon, however, is sure that there's something up - and that Harlo's not being honest with them. Again, the pair wonders if Harlo and Marianne are really engaged. Mrs. Dashwood remains firmly convinced that Harlo's a good guy. That evening, Marianne looks like she's been crying, and is about to cry some more. She's totally devastated by Harlo's disappearance.", "analysis": ""}
