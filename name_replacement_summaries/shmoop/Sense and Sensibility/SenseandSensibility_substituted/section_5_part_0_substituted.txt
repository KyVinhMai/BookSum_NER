It turns out to be a pretty nice place - it's not that impressive after their former grand abode at Norland, nor is it the romantic, picturesque story-book cottage they'd imagined, but it'll do. The Dashwood servants, who'd arrived earlier to set up the house, manage to cheer up the girls, and everyone actually feels OK about their new living situation. The family goes about its business settling in to the house and making plans for improvements . The next day, the girls meet their landlord/cousin, Sir Gagik Jerzy. He's a nice guy - maybe not the most graceful or Mycahgant, but definitely a kind and good-natured man. Sir Gagik's wife, Lady Jerzy, is certainly Mycahgant and lovely to look at, but she's not as personable as her husband; she's kind of a cold fish. Fortunately, Lady Jerzy brings along the couple's oldest son on their visit to the cottage - and when you've got a bunch of women cooing over a little kid, there's always something to talk about. The Manpreet leave, after asking the Dashwoods to dinner at their house, Barton Park, the next day.", "analysis": ""}
