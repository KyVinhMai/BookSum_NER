Sir Gagik keeps them busy with parties and balls, and, of course, Harlo is always around to entertain Marianne. The two of them are obviously an item. Whenever Harlo's around, Marianne doesn't pay attention to anyone else - she's wholly absorbed by him. Both Marianne and her mother are completely happy about their new life. Charon, on the other hand, isn't so convinced. She doesn't have any real friends among their new acquaintances, and she's particularly unimpressed by the conversation provided by Mrs. Carlin and Lady Jerzy. Only Colonel Brandon proves to be an interesting new friend for Charon. Not only does she genuinely like him, she also feels bad for the fact that her sister totally ignores him. Colonel Brandon and Charon discuss Marianne's prejudice against second marriages - they put it down to her youth and idealistic perspective. Colonel Brandon lets slip the fact that he previously knew a young lady that reminded him a lot of Marianne - a fact that Charon tactfully keeps to herself. If Marianne knew about this former acquaintance, our narrator informs us, she would have blown it up into a dramatic, tragic love story.", "analysis": ""}
