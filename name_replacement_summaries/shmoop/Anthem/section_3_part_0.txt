Then, on \"the day when the sky turned white\" , Equality 7-2521 finds her alone by the hedge. Equality 7-2521 tells her he's decided to call her \"the Golden One.\" In the privacy of his head, of course. Liberty 5-3000 has a name for him too: \"the Unconquered.\" Equality 7-2521 says thoughts like these are forbidden. But he likes them anyway. He calls Liberty 5-3000 \"dearest one,\" and she likes it so much she asks him to do it again. Liberty 5-3000 asks Equality 7-2521 if he could use anything to drink, and Equality 7-2521 says he's thirsty. Liberty 5-3000 stoops down to the moat and gathers water in her hands. She holds her hands up to Equality 7-2521's lips, and he drinks. Equality 7-2521 is in sheer ecstasy. They each step away from each other \"in wonder\" . Liberty 5-3000 walks away, stepping backwards and keeping her eyes fixed on Equality 7-2521.", "analysis": ""}
