More specifically, he's made a \"box of glass\" that bears a suspicious resemblance to a light bulb. Equality 7-2521 is thrilled: he can light all of the Cities in the world with his new invention. He can do it with nothing but metal and wires. He wants to share his secret with the others, and he wants the Scholars to help him develop and spread his invention. Equality 7-2521 decides that he will go to the World Council of Scholars, which is supposed to happen in a month in his very own City. There, he'll present his invention. He'll also confess everything. He thinks that he's sure to be forgiven, since he came up with something so great. But Equality 7-2521 also decides he has to guard his tunnel until then. If anybody sees it besides a Scholar, his invention might be in danger. Equality 7-2521 cares a great deal about his light. He also recognizes for the first time that he cares about his body, which made it. The light is almost like an extension of his body. He wonders for the first time what he actually looks like, because he's never seen himself before. Mirrors are apparently evil too.", "analysis": ""}
