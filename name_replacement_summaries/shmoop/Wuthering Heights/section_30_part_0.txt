Cathy cannot send a response because she has no paper. Heathcliff has taken everything away from her and Hareton has hidden some of her books in his room. After Cathy humiliates him for his illiteracy, Hareton returns the books to her. When she continues to mock him, he hits her and throws her books into the fire. Lockwood overhears Heathcliff tell himself how much Hareton's face reminds him of Catherine's. Lockwood stays for dinner. As he rides back to the Grange, he muses to himself, \"What a realization of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town!\" . He is truly out of it.", "analysis": ""}
