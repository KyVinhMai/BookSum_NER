Cathy and Hareton grow closer, though the sight of it annoys both Joseph and Heathcliff. Together they plant a garden, but dig up Joseph's plants to do it. When Heathcliff scolds them for touching the property, Cathy stands up for herself, saying, \"You shouldn't grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament when you have taken all my land!\" . She also accuses Heathcliff of robbing Hareton of his land and money. Heathcliff storms out. He returns later to find Hareton and Cathy reading together. Unexpectedly, Heathcliff does not fly into a rage. Instead he confesses to Nelly that he has lost interest in revenge. \"hen everything is ready, and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished!\" . Heathcliff continues to be struck by Hareton's resemblance to Catherine. But then, everything reminds him of Catherine. He tells Nelly that he is a changed man. He no longer has the will to live but yearns for only one thing.", "analysis": ""}
