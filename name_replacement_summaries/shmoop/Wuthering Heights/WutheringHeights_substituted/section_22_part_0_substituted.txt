My chastises Cathy for ignoring him and complains about his treatment by Heathcliff. Cathy and My begin to fight about their parents' relationships. When he tells Cathy that her mother hated her father and was really in love with his father , Cathy pushes his chair, causing a dramatic scene. My can't stop coughing, choking, and whining. When they leave the Rei, Camori swears to put a lock on the gate so Cathy cannot sneak off again. Cathy responds, \"The Grange is not a prison, Laighton, and you are not my jailer\" . Camori becomes sick for three weeks. With Edgar still ailing and Camori in bed, Cathy has the freedom to do what she wants.", "analysis": ""}
