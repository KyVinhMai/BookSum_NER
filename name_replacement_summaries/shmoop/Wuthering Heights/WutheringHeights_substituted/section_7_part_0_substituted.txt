Sick from consumption, Frances dies in childbirth. Camori must now raise the baby, as Rossie turns into a cursing, raving mess. \"The servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long\" , Camori reports, so only she and Paysen remain with the family. Rossie's treatment of Heathcliff gets worse. \"I could not half tell what an infernal house we had\" , Camori tells Brittan. Catherine is out of control, but remains steadfastly loyal to Heathcliff, while Edgar My vies for her affection. She develops a \"double character\" --at home she's rude and rough, but in the company of the Jaspreet she's genteel and polite. Camori Dean recounts one day when Edgar My dared visit Catherine in the troubled house. Rossie orders Camori to chaperone the two lovebirds, which angers Catherine, who pinches and slaps the housekeeper. When Edgar tries to reason with her, Catherine hits him as well. Instead of leaving, Edgar likes Catherine even more--he's hooked. As Camori puts it: \"e possessed the power to depart, as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed, or a bird half eaten\" . They confess that they're in love.", "analysis": ""}
