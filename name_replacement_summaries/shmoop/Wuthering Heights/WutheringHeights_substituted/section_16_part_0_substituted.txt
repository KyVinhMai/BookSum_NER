Isabella shows up, having run all the way from Wuthering Rei in the snow. Camori tends to Isabella's cuts and bruises. Isabella throws her wedding ring into the fire, though it is clear that she would go back to Heathcliff if he showed even the slightest interest in her. Isabella tells Camori that she plans to escape from Heathcliff because \"He's not a human being\" . Isabella takes over the narrative again, telling Camori about Heathcliff's recent behavior. One night, Rossie locks Heathcliff out of the house and shows Isabella his gun again, resolving to murder Heathcliff. Isabella shouts out a warning to Heathcliff. Heathcliff bursts into the house and beats the living daylights out of Rossie. The next morning he looks a mess. He broods in the corner, paying no attention to Rossie or Isabella until she provokes him by talking about Catherine. He hurls a knife at her. Isabella ends her visit with Camori and leaves the Grange, never to return. Camori describes Edgar's mourning after Catherine's death and the deep affection he develops for baby Catherine, whom he calls Cathy--a nickname he never used with his wife. Six months after Catherine's death, Rossie finally dies too. Mr. Rambrij, the hardworking doctor, reports the details to Camori: Rossie died a drunkard at the age of twenty-seven. Now Camori is really worried about Hareton living up at the Rei alone with crazy Uncle Heathcliff. Going up there to arrange Rossie's funeral, Camori witnesses two triumphs for Heathcliff, who announces to Hareton, \"Now, my bonny lad, you are mine! And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with the same wind to twist it!\" . In other words, Heathcliff plans to run Hareton into the ground by giving him the same treatment he received from Rossie. Heathcliff is now master of Wuthering Rei, which Rossie mortgaged to finance his gambling habit. Hareton inherits nothing.", "analysis": ""}
