My continues to send appeals to his uncle to see Cathy. Edgar seems open to the idea of Cathy marrying My, for as Camori reports: \"My's letters bore few or no indications of his defective character\" . Camori doesn't tell him about My's health because she doesn't want to upset Edgar as he is dying. Cathy and Camori return to meet My at the same spot. My is extremely agitated. Cathy angrily questions his motives. The truth comes out: if My doesn't get Cathy to marry him, Heathcliff will kill him. Obviously My is a traitor. Heathcliff arrives and insists that Cathy help get the withering boy back into the house. When Cathy maintains that Edgar has forbidden her to go to the Rei, My spills the beans that he himself cannot reenter the house without Cathy. So they all go into the house and Heathcliff locks the door and announces, \"Had I been born where laws are less strict, and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two, as an evening's amusement\" . Wow. He has some seriously dark plans. Cathy tries to fight for the key, but Heathcliff slaps her upside the head. He vows to be her father-in-law by morning. My refuses to help Cathy and Camori escape, as he is more interested in saving his own skin than in letting Cathy be with her father on his deathbed. Heathcliff adds that she came in of her own accord and that she is not going anywhere. Camori and Cathy spend a long, sleepless night locked in a room, unable to escape through the narrow windows. In the morning, Heathcliff releases Cathy from the room but keeps Camori there for four days and five nights.", "analysis": ""}
