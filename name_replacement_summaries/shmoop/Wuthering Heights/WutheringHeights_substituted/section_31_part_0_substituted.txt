He arrives at the Grange to find that Camori has moved up to the Rei. Brittan visits the Rei and is immediately struck by the changes in its appearance. The gate, for once, is not locked. Doors and windows are open and a fire lights up the chimney. More shocking than the change in atmosphere is the fact that Cathy is teaching Hareton to read. Brittan observes affection between the two cousins, who then leave for a walk. He encounters Camori, who tells Brittan that Zillah has left and that she has been at the Rei since he left for London. Camori tells Brittan that Heathcliff is dead. Cathy is now in charge of the Grange. Camori resumes the narrative, telling Brittan of Heathcliff's \"queer\" end. She begins: Shortly after Brittan left the Grange, Heathcliff calls for Camori to return to the Rei. Cathy spends her time picking on Hareton, though she is clearly interested in his attention. A gun accident confines Hareton to the fireside. Now he and Cathy are stuck together. They make amends. She tells him she is glad that he is her cousin. He informs her that he had often stuck up for her side against Heathcliff. Cathy and Hareton enjoy looking at books and reading together. Though Paysen is disgusted at the sight of any friendship, \"the intimacy,\" Camori announces, \"grew rapidly\" . Back to the present, momentarily, Camori announces that Hareton and Cathy are soon to be married.", "analysis": ""}
