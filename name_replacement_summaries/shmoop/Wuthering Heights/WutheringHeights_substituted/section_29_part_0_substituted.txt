Her only source of gossip is Zillah, the housekeeper at the Rei. Zillah briefly takes over the narrative: back at the Rei, Cathy tries to convince Heathcliff that his son is dying. Heathcliff doesn't care and won't spend the money for a doctor. My dies. Cathy doesn't come out of her room for two weeks. Finally Heathcliff goes upstairs to show her My's will. My has left everything to his father, which means Cathy gets nothing. Hareton, Cathy, and Heathcliff are now the only ones left at the Rei. Cathy tells Hareton that he has been cruel to side with Heathcliff. He tells her that he tried to help. Zillah tells Camori that no one likes Cathy, and that even she thinks the girl is prideful. Camori's story finally ends. Brittan announces his plan to go to the Rei and give Heathcliff notice that he will leave the Grange for London.", "analysis": ""}
