Camori forces the truth out of her, and Cathy briefly takes over the narrative. Here's Cathy's story: she goes to the Rei every night while Camori is sick. She and My spend all sorts of time talking and telling stories, finding out how little in common they have. One day, she runs into Hareton, who tries to impress her with the fact that he can now read his own name above the door. She just mocks him and goes into the house. Hareton bursts in and throws a screaming My into the kitchen. My later blames Cathy for the scene, but they make up. And that's the end of Cathy's narration. Camori promptly tells Edgar about Cathy's visits to the Rei; again, she is forbidden to go there.", "analysis": ""}
