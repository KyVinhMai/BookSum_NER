The housekeeper from the Rei updates Camori on how things are going between My and his father--as expected, not good. My is sick all of the time and is \"selfish and disagreeable\" . On her sixteenth birthday, Cathy announces that she would like to spend the day on the moors. Of course, she begins to make her way toward Wuthering Rei, and she and Camori run into Heathcliff, who invites them back to the house, insisting that Cathy come see My. As he drags them back to the house, Heathcliff announces his plan to have the cousins get married, so that he can inherit the Grange when Edgar dies. It's all about property. Cathy is thrilled at finding these relatives living so near to the Grange and chastises Camori for not telling her about them. Heathcliff mentions Edgar's \"prejudice\" against him and complains to Camori that his own son is a wimp. Heathcliff explains to Camori that he sympathizes with Hareton and yet has enjoyed mistreating him, degrading him, and turning him into an animal who scorns \"book-larning\"--all as revenge against his father, Rossie. Heathcliff enjoys pitting Hareton against his son in an effort to make My seem more appealing to Cathy, simply because he has a glimmer of intelligence next to his oaf of a cousin. Rather than keep the visit a secret, Cathy announces it to her father the next day. Edgar tells her the whole dark story: how Heathcliff ran away with Aunt Isabella and desires only revenge. Cathy wants to begin writing letters to My. When Camori refuses to help her, Cathy finds a milk-fetcher to be her delivery boy. She quickly accumulates a mass of letters, which she hides in a drawer. Camori collects them all, and when she confronts Cathy about her disobedience, she finds out that Cathy is in love with My. Camori burns the letters and puts an end to the correspondence.", "analysis": ""}
