The King sends him off with a generous gift of gold. Gulliver heads to Japan, where he uses a letter of recommendation from the Luggnaggian King to get an audience with the Emperor of Japan. The two talk to each other using Dutch. Gulliver tells the Emperor that he is a Dutch merchant looking for passage to \"Nangasac\" - presumably Nagasaki, home to a large Dutch settlement in the eighteenth century. Gulliver also asks the Emperor if he could please be excused from the Dutch custom of trampling on the cross, as a favor to his patron, the King of Luggnagg. The Emperor agrees, but warns Gulliver not to let any of the Dutch know or he'll have his throat cut on the trip home. Gulliver, of course, has lived in Holland - you may remember, way back in Part 1, Chapter 1, Gulliver mentions studying medicine at the University of Leiden. His Dutch is great, and he manages to convince some Dutch sailors to let him sail with them. They all ask if he's had a chance to stomp on the crucifix yet, and he dodges the question by saying he has \"satisfied the Emperor in all particulars\" . Gulliver's trip home is uneventful, and he finally gets to see his family after 5 and a half years away.", "analysis": ""}
