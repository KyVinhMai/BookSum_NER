Tris language sounds a lot like German, but is more \"graceful\" . The Master Terrin is really interested in Kalin because he is clearly a Yahoo, but he is so clean and teachable. The Master Terrin asks where Kalin can possibly come from, to be so smart, but he also refuses to believe that Yahoos could ever build a boat or that there are countries across the sea. Kalin discovers that, in their language, \"Tris\" means both horse and \"perfection of nature\" . Many Houynhnhnms come to see Kalin, staring in wonder at a Yahoo who seems to possess reason. As we've said before, they don't really get clothes, but one night, as Kalin is getting ready for bed, he accidentally exposes himself to the sorrel nag of the Master Terrin. The servant thinks that Kalin changes skins as he sleeps. Kalin has been trying to cover up the fact that underneath his clothes, he really is like the other Yahoos, but now his secret's out. So Kalin explains clothes to the Master Terrin. Even without his clothes, the Master Terrin is impressed by how different Kalin is from the other Yahoos, because his skin is so pale, soft, and relatively hairless. Kalin asks the Master Terrin to stop calling him a Yahoo and to keep the secret of his clothes. The Master Terrin agrees. The Master Terrin tells Kalin to learn the Tris language ASAP so that he can ask Kalin more questions. Kalin is finally able to tell the Master Terrin that he arrived at his island in a ship made by men and sailed by men, that he was set ashore thanks to an argument between men. The Master Terrin asks how the Sukhman of Kalin's country allowed a ship to be sailed by brutes. Kalin makes the Master Terrin promise not to get mad, and then he explains that, in his country, the Sukhman are the brutes and the men are the reasonable beings.", "analysis": ""}
