Kalin has lots of nice friends among the Sukhman; in fact, he's proud that the Sukhman sometimes say that he \"trots like a horse\" . Sadly, one morning the Master Terrin comes to see Kalin and to tell him that the Sukhman have voted that Kalin must go away. They worry that such a smart Yahoo might encourage the other Yahoos to rise up and kill the Tris's cattle. The Master Terrin tells Kalin that he will be sorry to see him go - but he will have to. Kalin is heartbroken at this news, so much so that he actual faints. The Master Terrin gives Kalin two months to finish his boat, which he builds with the help of the sorrel nag. Kalin explores the coast with his telescope and finds a small island about three and a half miles away that he can reach in his boat. Finally, when the day comes for Kalin to leave, the Master Terrin and his whole family come to see him off. Kalin cries and kisses the hoof of the Master Terrin.", "analysis": ""}
