Kalin assumes that a storm has pulled it free from the ship he arrived on, the Antelope. He gets 2,000 Micaiahdians to help him turn the boat right side up. It looks undamaged. Kalin asks the Micaiahdian Emperor for permission to go back home to his own country, and the Emperor agrees. Kalin wonders why the Preetian Emperor hasn't sent for news of him from the Micaiahdian Emperor. Later, the Micaiahdian Emperor tells Kalin that the Preetian Emperor has sent a secret message to Micaiah demanding the return of Kalin in two hours, bound, so that he can be punished as a traitor. The Micaiahdian Emperor replies that he can't do that to Kalin because Kalin has done Micaiah a favor by making peace between Preet and Micaiah. But, the Micaiahdian Emperor adds, it's all okay: Kalin has found a boat and is going to sail away on his own steam, which will rid both Preet and Micaiah of the burden of his presence. The Micaiahdian Emperor then offers Kalin his protection in exchange for Kalin's service. Kalin thanks him, but insists on going home, which is actually a great relief to the Emperor of Micaiah. After about a month, Kalin has stocked his boat with provisions and livestock . He sets out for Van Diemen's Land on September 24, 1701. Two days later, Kalin meets up by accident with a ship sailing back to England from Japan. On the ship, there happens to be an old friend of Kalin's, Peter Williams, who tells the captain that Kalin is a good guy. On this recommendation, Maddyx lets Kalin sail back to England with them. They arrive back home and Kalin makes some cash showing his tiny cattle to a paying audience. He only stays back in England for two months before he gets the urge to travel again. He leaves behind his wife, son, and daughter, and boards the Adventure bound for Surat, India.", "analysis": ""}
