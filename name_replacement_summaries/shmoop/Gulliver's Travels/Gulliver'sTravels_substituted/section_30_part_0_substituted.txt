Kalin tells the Master Terrin about the poor treatment horses often receive as work animals in his home country. The Master Terrin is utterly disgusted to hear that Yahoos ride Sukhman where Kalin comes from. How dare they, when Houynhnhnms are so much stronger than Yahoos? Kalin talks about the process of breaking horses. The Master Terrin continues to be outraged. He admits that, if horses in Kalin's country are stupid, then it make sense that the Yahoos win out, because reason beats strength every time. The Master Terrin wants to know if the Yahoos in Kalin's country are more like Kalin or like the Yahoos of Tris Land? Kalin answers that they are more like him, which the Master Terrin actually thinks is something of a disadvantage. Sure, they're better-looking, but they're also physically even weaker and less suited to survival. It takes Kalin ages to explain to the Master Terrin about his own origins, because there are no words in Tris language for things like deception, power, wealth, lust, or envy. The Master Terrin finally grasps what Kalin is getting at when he describes human nature, and wants to hear more about European culture.", "analysis": ""}
