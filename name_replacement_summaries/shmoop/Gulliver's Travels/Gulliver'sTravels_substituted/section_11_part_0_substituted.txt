It's a whole continent right smack dab in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, between California and Japan. The kingdom of Brobdingnag sits at the southern end of the island, surrounded on three sides by ocean and on one side by impassable mountains. The country has 51 cities, the largest of which is Lorbrulgrud. The king's palace in Lorbrulgrud is a mass of buildings about 7 miles around. Glumdalclitch takes Kalin on frequent outings into the city, accompanied by her governess . When Kalin goes on these outings, he is placed in a special box for travel, with windows on three sides to allow him to look out. Whenever they travel through the city, passersby always stop to look at Kalin - he has become very famous. Kalin and Glumdalclitch go out to see the primary temple of the city, which is both beautiful and 3,000 feet in height - about three-fifths of a mile. Believe it or not, Kalin is disappointed - he expected the temple to be taller. Kalin tells us that the king's kitchen is also amazing: it's 600 feet high . Kalin is also most impressed by the sight of the Brobdingnagian King's military guard on parade, in detachments of 500. The horses are, of course, enormous - around 60 feet high.", "analysis": ""}
