After Angel leaves, she tiptoes partway up the stairs, and hears anguished moaning from the D'Urberville room. She peeps in at the keyhole, and sees Tess crying at the breakfast table in the outer room, and overhears Alec asking what is wrong. She overhears part of the explanation--Tess saying that she had lost Angel again because of Alec, and that Alec had torn her life to shreds and had caged her forever. Mrs. Brooks is afraid of being caught eavesdropping, so she hurries back downstairs, and heads back to the kitchen to finish her own breakfast. After a while, she looks out the window, and sees Tess leaving the hotel. She doesn't think much of it --her wealthy guests must have had a spat, that's all. But then, after a while, she glances towards the ceiling, and sees a bright red splotch there. She climbs up on a table and touches it--it's blood. She gets a couple of male servants to go with her, and goes upstairs to investigate. Alec has been stabbed to death and is lying in the bed.", "analysis": ""}
