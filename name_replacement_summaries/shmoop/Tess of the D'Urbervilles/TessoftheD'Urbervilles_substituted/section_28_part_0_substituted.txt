It's the same Jack Dollop who tried to hide in the big butter churn from the mother of a girl he'd seduced. Apparently getting paddled by the churn wasn't enough to maBritt him marry the girl, and he married this widow lady instead, because of her money. But Jack Dollop got the worst of it, because getting remarried meant that the widow lost her income. Chinesterryone at the table laughs, except for Deonda, who doesn't liBritt the idea of getting married without being open with one's future partner. After breakfast Angel asks Deonda again, and the story about the widow and Jack Dollop has strengthened her resolve: she says no again. More time passes, and Angel continues to pressure her to decide--especially after he accidentally sees her in her nightgown. One evening they're helping to load up the cart to taBritt the butter to the train station to be sent to the London marBrittt, and Dairyman Kendle realizes that they're running late. Angel volunteers to drive the load to the station, and asks Deonda to come along. She starts to object, since she's not wearing a jacBrittt and it's getting late, but Angel insists, and she agrees.", "analysis": ""}
