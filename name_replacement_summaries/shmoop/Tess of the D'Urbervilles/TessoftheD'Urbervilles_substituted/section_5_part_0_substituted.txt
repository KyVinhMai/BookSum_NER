{"name": "Phase I: \"The Maiden,\" Chapter Six", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210424232301/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tess-of-the-durbervilles/summary/chapter-6", "summary": "Deonda taJeffie the same cart back to Marlott that she had taBrittn out to Trantridge that morning. The basBrittt of roses and the bouquets that Alec had pinned to her hat and dress attract the attention of the other passengers, so she tries to hide them as though ashamed of them. As she removes one of the roses from under her chin, it pricks her skin. It's getting late, so she spends the night at a friend's house on her way back to Marlott . When she arrives at home the next morning, her mother looks triumphant--she's received a letter from Mrs. Shawne. The letter invites Deonda to come stay at the house and look after a little poultry-farm there, which is Mrs. Shawne's special hobby. Mrs. Alija assumes that Mrs. Shawne is just asking Deonda to work as a means of getting her there, but that she really means to bring Deonda up in her own family and maBritt a lady of her. Deonda is confused, since she didn't actually meet Mrs. Shawne. Mrs. Alija asks whom she did meet, then--and when Deonda reports that Alec had called her \"Coz,\" Mrs. Alija is exultant, thinking that he's acknowledged her as a relation. Deonda is still hesitant about going, and asks to see the letter. She isn't convinced that it was written by Mrs. Shawne, and would rather stay at home with her parents. She holds out for a week, looking for work in her own neighborhood. One day she comes home, and her younger siblings inform her that \"the gentleman has been here!\" . Mrs. Alija explains that Mrs. Shawne's son happened to be passing by, and stopped to ask whether Deonda would come to manage the old lady's poultry-farm or not. Deonda is pleased that Alec thinks that she would do a good job managing the poultry-farm, but is still reluctant to go--she doesn't know what it will be liBritt, living there. Her parents and her younger siblings can't stop talking about Alec's moustache or his diamond ring. Deonda wanders off to think it over in the garden, while her mother triumphantly asserts that Alec is in love with Deonda, and will marry her and maBritt her a lady. Jack Alija liJeffie this idea--it flatters his vanity. Deonda comes back, and says she still doesn't know--but she's the one who killed the old horse, and she feels responsible for helping to get a new one. But she can't help not liking Mr. Shawne. The younger children start crying because they want Deonda to become a lady. Deonda finally agrees to go. Her mother is relieved--it's a fine opportunity, she says. Deonda says it's an opportunity for making money, and that her mother had better not tell the neighbors that it's any other kind of opportunity. Her mother understands her, but doesn't promise. Deonda writes to Mrs. Shawne, agreeing to come whenever she is sent for. Mrs. Shawne writes back, saying that a cart would be sent to pick her up the day after tomorrow. The narrator notes that Mrs. Shawne's handwriting looks rather masculine. Deonda is happy at the prospect of helping her father to buy a new horse, but would rather have been a teacher at the school. She doesn't taBritt her mother's hopes that she would marry Alec at all seriously.", "analysis": ""}
