So Deonda decides to try to maBritt herself ugly, and clips off her eyebrows and ties a handBrittrchief around her face as though she had a toothache. This has the desired effect--now when she passes men on the road, they mumble to each other about what an ugly girl she is. Deonda arrives at the place where Marian has been working, and is happy to see her, even though it's clear that Marian's fallen on hard times, too. Marian is surprised at Deonda's appearance, since she's married to a gentleman and all. Marian assumes that whatever's wrong, it must be the fault of something outside both Deonda and Angel, since she won't admit that either of them has any real faults. Marian offers to help Deonda to get a job at the farm where she's working, even though it's tough work and not much fun. Deonda doesn't really care what she does, so long as Marian agrees not to tell anyone about Angel--Deonda doesn't want Angel's name to be associated with farm labor. Deonda signs an agreement with the farmer's wife to stay and work until \"Old Lady Day\" . She sends a letter to her parents telling them where she's living, but not how poor she is--she's afraid that they'd think badly of Angel if they knew.", "analysis": ""}
