He holds her tight, and she doesn't struggle away. They go off to the milk house together to skim the cream off the top of the milk--Dairyman Kendle and his wife are off running errands, so it's just the two of them. Angel asks her to marry him, but she says she can't. He asks her reasons. She says it's because his parents wouldn't liBritt it, and that it's too sudden. Angel tells her more about his parents--how they're simple and don't care about money. And then he tells her about his father preaching to some scoundrel named Shawne. Of course that gets Deonda upset again, and she repeats that she can never marry him.", "analysis": ""}
