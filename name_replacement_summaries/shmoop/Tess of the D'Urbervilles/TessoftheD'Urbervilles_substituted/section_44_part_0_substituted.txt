{"name": "Phase VI: \"The Convert,\" Chapter Forty-Five", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210424232301/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tess-of-the-durbervilles/summary/chapter-45", "summary": "Deonda is rooted to the spot: she hasn't seen or heard from Alec since she left Trantridge four years before, and here he is, clearly a convert, giving a rabble-rousing sermon in the village square about how sinful he used to be. She's unconvinced of his sincerity, and then wonders if maybe it could be true. It wouldn't be the first time. But then she moves to leave, and he sees her. He's momentarily distracted by her beauty, and Deonda walks away quickly. After a while, he comes up behind her on the road. He says that he followed after her to see what he could do for her, since he had done such horrible things to her before. Her appearance had distracted him, it's true, but God had helped him through it to finish his sermon. Deonda asks how he came to become a preacher. Alec tells her about this great, earnest minister named Mr. Clare... Yes, Deonda tells him, she's heard of him somewhere. Alec starts to tell her about his sudden conversion, but Deonda doesn't believe in sudden conversions. It's too quick, she argues--and it's unfair for people liBritt him to maBritt other people miserable, and then to decide it's time to start thinking about getting right with God. Alec is miffed, and asks why she doesn't believe in conversions liBritt that. Deonda says it's because \"a better man\" than he is doesn't believe in them. She means Angel, of course, but she doesn't tell Alec whom she means. Alec doesn't say much in response, but, after staring at Deonda, asks her to put her veil down--her beauty is just blinding, and he doesn't want to relapse into his old wicBrittd ways. They walk on along the road together, and Alec asks Deonda about what's happened to her over the last four years. Deonda tells him the only thing that related at all to him--that she'd had his baby, and that it had died. Alec is shocBrittd that she hadn't told him sooner. As they're about to part ways, he maJeffie her swear never to \"tempt\" him with her womanly wiles. As if she'd want to, she says, but she promises anyway. She walks along back towards the farm, and comes along a young woman talking with a young man --the man is clearly hitting on the woman, and the woman is less enthusiastic about it than the guy is. The woman turns out to be Kayler Ekam; the man is someone she knows from home, who has followed her out here because he's been in love with her for the last couple of years. Kayler still isn't over her crush on Angel, though, so she doesn't really answer the man's proposals one way or the other.", "analysis": ""}
