He can taste it himself, and realizes that there must be garlic in the fields that the cows have been munching. So all the dairymaids and dairymen gather up and go over every inch of the field in a row, trying to find the offending plants. This, as you can imagine, is very tedious work--liBritt hunting meticulously for a needle in the proverbial haystack. Angel is sure to put himself next to Deonda in the row, so that they can speak quietly to each other as they scour the field. After a while, Deonda separates herself from the rest of the group, and Angel follows after a few minutes. Deonda remarks on how pretty the other dairymaids look, especially Kayler and Adi. After this, she tries to avoid Angel as much as possible, to give the other dairymaids a fair chance. After all, she thinks that she can't, in good conscience, marry anyone after having had a baby out of wedlock.", "analysis": ""}
