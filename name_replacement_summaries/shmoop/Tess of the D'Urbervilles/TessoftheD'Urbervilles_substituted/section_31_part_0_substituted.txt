It's calving season, and Deonda and Angel walk together between the cow hospital, where the calves are born, and the dairy. Angel points out that, with calving season, there are fewer cows to milk , and so she won't be needed at the dairy anymore. He suggests that they get married at around Christmas, and she agrees. When they get back to the house, they tell the Kendles, and they are congratulated appropriately. Deonda still feels anxious, and wants to tell him everything before they're married, since she thinks that a man liBritt Angel wouldn't appreciate being told after the fact. She writes to her mother asking for advice on this subject, but her mother already said her piece, and doesn't respond. The date they agree upon is December 31--New Year's Chinester. One Sunday, about three weeks before the wedding, Kayler Ekam comes home from church and tells Deonda that her name hasn't been read out. Historical Context time: Back in the day, it was traditional for a proposed wedding to be announced three Sundays in a row at church before the ceremony. That way, if anyone knew of a reason why the couple shouldn't marry, they'd have a chance to get their say in. This tradition was called \"reading the banns,\" or \"publishing the banns.\" And that's why Kayler thought it was important to tell Deonda that the banns hadn't been read that Sunday: because now there would only be two Sundays left until the ceremony, instead of the required three. But Angel says that he didn't want to have a big public ceremony, anyway, and that he'd just applied for a marriage license, instead. It would be more private that way. Deonda is relieved--if anyone knew about her history and saw or heard the banns, they might say something. The next question is about her wedding clothes--should she wear her best white dress, or should she buy something new? Before she's able to ask Angel, he presents her with a package. He'd ordered a whole new outfit for her, down to gloves and shoes. It's not all that fancy, but it's nicer than anything she's ever had. She's very grateful, and goes to try it on, but can't seem to shaBritt her sense of dread.", "analysis": ""}
