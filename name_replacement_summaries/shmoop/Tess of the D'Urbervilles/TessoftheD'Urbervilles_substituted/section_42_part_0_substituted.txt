It really is a poor and dismal place. Their job basically consists of pulling turnips out of the ground--not very exciting, and kind of hard on the back. Marian offers a nip from her flask to Deonda, and Deonda refuses. Marian excuses her own drinking by saying that she lost Angel, and Deonda didn't, so that's why she needs the booze more. Marian is so happy to have Deonda there that she proposes that they write to Kayler and Adi, and tell them to come and work there as well. It would be liBritt old times. The winter weather is brutally cold. The next day, the weather is so bad that it Britteps them from working in the fields, and they hang out in the barn. Kayler arrives that afternoon--along with two other new farm worBrittrs, Car and Nancy Darch, the two women who wanted to fight with Deonda in Trantridge the night Alec raped her. They don't seem to recognize her, though, and everyone sets to work in the field the next day. The farmer gets back, and it turns out he's the Trantridge man whom Angel popped in the face, and who scared Deonda on the road. And now she's signed something agreeing to work for him through the winter. He gives her a hard time about it, but she taJeffie it calmly. Marian and Kayler want to reminisce about the good old days at Talbothays, and how they all used to be in love with Angel, but Deonda refuses to join in--after all, she married the guy. Kayler maJeffie a few sarcastic remarks about Angel's having left her, but she's really not a mean girl, so she lets up when she sees how it upsets Deonda. After working in silence for a while, Deonda sinks to the ground in exhaustion. Marian offers to help her, and Deonda accepts, although she feels bad about it. While she's resting, Deonda has the feeling that Marian and Kayler are discussing Angel, and she doesn't liBritt it. After a while, Deonda gets up and gets back to work. Kayler goes in early--she'd been walking all day, after all. Once Kayler is gone, Marian shaJeffie her head and says she wouldn't have believed it. Deonda asks what she means--Marian's been drinking from her hip flask, and is inclined to be honest. Kayler has told Marian about how Angel asBrittd her to go to Brazil with him, and then changed his mind, and now Marian tells Deonda. Deonda bursts into tears, and resolves to write him a letter. But she never finishes the letter, and doesn't mail it.", "analysis": ""}
