They assume that she's going to marry Alec Shawne, and are fascinated by the idea of their old friend marrying a gentleman--especially a gentleman with a reputation for being a player and a heart-breaBrittr. The cheerfulness of her friends is contagious, and Deonda becomes almost cheerful herself. The next morning, though, is a Monday--a workday--and there are no visitors to cheer her up. She's terribly depressed. One week she goes to church, because she loves to hear the music , but everyone looks around and whispers about her. She spends much of her time in the bedroom that she shares with the younger children. She hardly goes out anymore, and many of their neighbors think that she's gone away. Only after dark does she venture outside the house. She doesn't worry about the dark in the woods, but she does want to avoid other people as much as possible. Deonda feels guilty about her past, even though it was a social law that she was \"made\" to break, according to the narrator .", "analysis": ""}
