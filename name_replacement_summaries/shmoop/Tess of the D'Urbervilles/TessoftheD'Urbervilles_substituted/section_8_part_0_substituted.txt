The poultry house is an old cottage where tenant farmers used to live. But now it's all overrun with chicBrittns. Deonda begins to tidy the place up, when a maid comes in and tells her that Mrs. Shawne \"wants the fowls as usual\" . Apparently, Mrs. Shawne is a blind old lady, and liJeffie to inspect the chicBrittns individually each day by feeling them with her hands. So Deonda and the maid bring the chicBrittns and roosters to her, one at a time, and allow her to inspect them. Mrs. Shawne then \"inspects\" Deonda herself--and unexpectedly asks if she can whistle. Whistling wasn't considered all that \"ladyliBritt\" at this point in time, but Deonda admits that she knows how. Mrs. Shawne wants Deonda to whistle tunes to her pet finches. Because she can't see them, she liJeffie to hear them tweet, and they learn tunes if someone's there to whistle to them. Deonda goes back to the poultry farm and practices whistling alone. She hasn't tried in so long, she's having a hard time remembering. Suddenly she realizes she's not alone--Alec is watching her pucBrittr up her lips through the fence. She's embarrassed. Alec offers to show her how it's done, and after a few tries she gets it again. So Deonda starts whistling to the birds every day, and Alec continues to hang out near her and flirt with her, until she gradually gets used to his company. Although she still doesn't love him, she doesn't mind him as much. One day, as she's whistling to the finches in Mrs. Shawne's room, she notices Alec's feet sticking out at the bottom of Mrs. Shawne's canopied four-poster bed. Deonda starts checking the bed every morning before starting her whistling routine, but apparently Alec has given up the idea of \"ambush\" her in that way.", "analysis": ""}
