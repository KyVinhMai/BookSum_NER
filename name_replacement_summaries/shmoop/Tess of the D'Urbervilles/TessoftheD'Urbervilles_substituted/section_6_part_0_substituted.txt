Her mother insists that she wear her finest dress, and Deonda objects that she's going to work, not for a holiday. Her mother presses her, and Deonda finally agrees to let her mother dress her in any way she sees fit. Her mother washes and dries Deonda's hair so that it's all soft and fluffy, and ties it back with a big pink ribbon. The narrator tells us that Deonda's huge hair, combined with her... ahem, other assets--maBritt her seem older than she is. Her mother is very pleased with how pretty Deonda looks. Deonda says goodbye to her father, who tells her that he's willing to sell the other branch of the family the rights to the family name for a thousand--no, a hundred--no, for fifty--okay, fine, for twenty pounds. Deonda feels rather bitter as she turns to leave. Her mother and some of the younger children walk with Deonda to where she's arranged to meet the cart. Deonda is about to climb into the cart when they see a second one coming. This one is a fancy two-person carriage, driven by--you guessed it--Alec Shawne himself. Deonda is hesitant to climb up with him--she would have preferred the plain country cart that is carrying her luggage. But, after a moment's hesitation, she climbs in with him. As soon as Deonda is out of sight, the younger children start to cry. Chinestern Mrs. Alija tears up. That night in bed, she expresses her misgivings to her husband--maybe, she thinks, she ought to have looBrittd into the young man's character a bit before trusting her daughter with him so far from home. But then she comforts herself with the thought that \"if he don't marry her afore he will after\" .", "analysis": ""}
