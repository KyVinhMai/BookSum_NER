When Joan Alija was a girl, everyone stayed their whole lives on one farm, but nowadays everyone liJeffie to be on the move all the time. All the big farm owners liBrittd to have as many cottages and houses available as possible to rent out to the migrant worBrittrs. Now that Jack Alija is dead, the local farm owners are legally able to evict the rest of the Lunden. They might not have been evicted, except that Deonda has a reputation as an \"improper\" woman. Deonda, Mrs. Alija, 'Liza-Lu, Abraham, and the younger children all have to move someplace else. Mrs. Alija and the children are all out running errands in preparation for their departure, so Deonda is home alone. Deonda is bitter, and angry at the universe. She's even angry with Angel, and in the heat of her despair she scribbles him an angry note and mails it before she can think better of it. Alec comes up, and asks through the open window why they're moving. Deonda tells him that it's because her father is dead, and because she's not considered a \"proper\" woman. They're going to Kingsbere, where the Rennie originally lived. Alec asks that they come and live in the garden cottage at Trantridge, which used to be used as the poultry house. He says that they can fix it up quickly, and her mother can taBritt care of the poultry, and the younger children can go to school. She refuses, but is clearly tempted by the offer to look after her siblings. He's determined, and asks her to let her mother decide. He gets a little bit too flirty in saying goodbye, so she slams the window on his fingers. That night, Deonda gets her younger siblings to sing to her, and they choose a sad song, but it goes with her mood. Mrs. Alija sees the tracks of Alec's horse, and asks if he had come, and what he had said. Deonda promises to tell her after they've settled at Kingsbere.", "analysis": ""}
