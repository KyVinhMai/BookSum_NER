He's surprised that Tess, a country girl, would have chosen such a bustling, modern place to live. The next morning, he goes to the post office to ask for the address of a Mrs. Clare. No luck. But Angel remembers that Tess wasn't using her married name, so he asks for a Miss Durbeyfield. Still nothing. But there's a D'Urberville staying at a nearby hotel... Angel hurries to the hotel, and asks for Mrs. D'Urberville. He asks the messenger to say that it's \"Angel.\" She appears on the stairs in a beautiful gown--Angel can't understand how she got the money for it. He reaches for her, begging her forgiveness for leaving, and she shrieks that it's too late. She says that \"he\" had won her back to him, by swearing up and down that Angel would never come back to her. They look at each other in anguish, and Tess runs back upstairs, and Angel walks slowly back out into the street.", "analysis": ""}
