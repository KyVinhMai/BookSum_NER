He traces her to the farm where she had worked all winter, and he learns there that she wasn't using her married name at all. From there he traces her to her parents' house in Marlott. He asks around, and finds that the Jack Durbeyfield was dead, and that the rest of the family had intended to go live at Kingsbere, but had instead moved someplace else. Angel gets the address, and leaves Marlott. He arrives at Mrs. Durbeyfield's house that evening, and Tess isn't there. He asks where she is, and Mrs. Durbeyfield says that she's not sure whether Tess would want to see him. Angel begs to know where she is, and Mrs. Durbeyfield finally says that Tess is in the town of Sandbourne, but doesn't know the exact address. Angel then offers to help them if they need anything, but Mrs. Durbeyfield declines the offer, saying that they have enough.", "analysis": ""}
