Another woman, the short, plump wife of the grocer, sits with her. In the past week, this woman has taken on a new name: she's now called \"The Vengeance.\" We're guessing it's not because she's all that friendly. Defarge enters the shop. Immediately, everyone quiets down to hear what he has to say. Luckily, he actually does have something to say: Foulon, an old aristocrat who once told the peasants that they could eat grass, has been imprisoned. He's on his way to Paris now, escorted by a revolutionary guard. Defarge pauses, then asks if the \"patriots\" are ready for action. Madame Defarge grabs her knife. The Vengeance begins to shriek. They run to different houses in the area with the news. Soon an entire crowd has gathered outside the house where Foulon has been taken. Madame Defarge rushes into the house to see the old man bound up in ropes. She begins to clap as if she's just seen a great play. Defarge rushes up to Foulon and \"folds him in a deadly embrace.\" We're guessing that means he kills the guy. Madame Defarge tries to strangle him with his ropes. The Vengeance and Jacques Three drag the body out into the streets. Hoards of people scream at the sight. They begin to stuff the dead man's pockets with grass. Poetic justice, eh? Once his head and heart are set on pikes, however, the crowd begins to disperse. After all, they're still poor and miserable. They all head to the bread lines to beg for some loaves of bread. As Monsieur Defarge returns to his wine-shop, he remarks to his wife that the revolution seems to have come at last.", "analysis": ""}
