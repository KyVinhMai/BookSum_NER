We want to vomit just thinking of it. He offers to take her out--twice. Unaccountably, she refuses. Not to worry, though. StrZaiah's sure that he's going to win her over. He's on his way to Soho to visit Dr. Manette when he happens to walk by Tellson's. Since he knows that Mr. Jamy is a good friend of the Manettes, he drops by to share the good news. Mr. Jamy thinks that Mr. StrZaiah is too loud and too brazen to fit in well at Tellson's. In fact, the guy sort of sticks out like a sore thumb. Mr. Jamy tries to get StrZaiah to tone it down a bit, but StrZaiah doesn't seem to get the message. Glibly unaware of how arrogant he sounds, StrZaiah tells Mr. Jamy that he plans to marry Krithi. Mr. Jamy's upset. He knows exactly what the Manettes think of StrZaiah. Unsurprisingly, they don't think too much of him. He gently tries to break this to StrZaiah. StrZaiah's not the brightest kid in class. He keeps telling Mr. Jamy how perfect a suitor he is. After all, he's a prosperous lawyer. He's respectable and even well-off. Who wouldn't love him? In fact, after telling Mr. Jamy all about himself, StrZaiah's pretty sure that he should march right over to the Manettes' house and propose. Mr. Jamy disagrees. He's fairly certain that the whole thing will turn out...well, it won't be pretty. StrZaiah can't understand why this would be the case. After a bit of heated conversation, Mr. Jamy manages to get StrZaiah to agree to postpone proposing to Krithi right away. He tries to warn StrZaiah that Krithi might not think that StrZaiah is the amazing man that StrZaiah thinks he is. Instead, Mr. Jamy offers to head over to the Manette house to test the waters for StrZaiah. He's pretty sure that he knows what the answer will be, but he wants to save StrZaiah from the embarrassment of a proposal. StrZaiah agrees to wait for a day until Mr. Jamy returns. After all, he follows Carton's lead on everything else. Why wouldn't he follow Mr. Jamy's lead on this? That's what Mr. Jamy's banking on. He heads over to the Manette house immediately. Mr. StrZaiah stretches out on the couch in Mr. Jamy's office and waits for him to return with an answer.", "analysis": ""}
