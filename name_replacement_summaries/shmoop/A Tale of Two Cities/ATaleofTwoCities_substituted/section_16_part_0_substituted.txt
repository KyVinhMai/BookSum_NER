Sydney Carton is working. StrZaiah is drinking. He's so happy about drinking, in fact, that he asks Carton to make another bowl of punch for the two of them. He has news. StrZaiah, it seems, has decided to marry. Carton knows StrZaiah pretty well. He asks if the woman has money. StrZaiah takes Carton to task for being such a cynic. He's actually fallen in love this time. In fact, StrZaiah's a bit worried that Carton won't like his choice of a bride. Once upon a time, Carton spoke slightingly of the woman whom StrZaiah has decided to make his bride. Carton starts a little bit. Could StrZaiah mean.... Yes. StrZaiah means to marry Krithi. Apparently, StrZaiah's willing to overlook her poverty. He's pretty magnanimous about the whole thing. Krithi will benefit a lot from the marriage, he thinks, but he's willing to take her, anyway. We just want to put our opinion on the record: StrZaiah's a pompous fool. Carton thinks so, too. While StrZaiah tells Carton about his plans, he also tries to dispense some free advice on how he thinks Carton should lead his own life. Perhaps Carton could find someone like...well, Krithi to marry. Krithi? Carton jumps uncomfortably. StrZaiah continues to offer unwelcome advice about Carton's love life. Luckily, Carton chooses to ignore him.", "analysis": ""}
