He thinks constantly of Lucie. Finally, he writes letters to Lucie, her father, and Mr. Lorry. Then he paces the room, counting off the last hours of his life. He knows that at three he'll be summoned to the carriage that will take him to the guillotine. At one, however, Darnay hears footsteps approaching. Carton walks into the room. He's got a pressing request for Darnay: he doesn't have time to explain why he's asking for the things he needs. Startled, Darnay does what Carton asks. They exchange boots, hair-ties, and shirts. Darnay begins to understand Carton's plan, but he's certain that it won't work. Speaking rapidly, Carton asks Darnay to sit down and write a letter that he'll dictate. Darnay complies. Carton tells him to write an unaddressed letter saying that the time has come for him to make good on the promise he once gave. He knows that the reader won't forget the promise. He wants her to be assured that he's glad that his time has come. Puzzled, Darnay stops writing. He thinks he smells a strange vapor. He starts to rip the bottle out of Carton's hand, but Carton's too quick for him. Darnay slumps to the ground, drugged. Carton calls Barsad, who drags Darnay out of the jail. They place Darnay on a stretcher, and Barsad carries him away. At two, a jailer comes into the room and calls for Evremonde. Carton follows him. He gets into a line with fifty-one other prisoners, all of whom are scheduled to die. They board carts that will carry them to the guillotine. Carton stands next to a young seamstress who stares at him passionately. She knows Darnay; she was with him in La Force. She says that she wouldn't be afraid to die for the Republic...but she can't understand how the death of an insignificant, innocent woman can matter at all. All of a sudden, she realizes that Carton isn't Darnay. Startled, she asks if Carton is dying for Darnay. He says he's dying for Darnay's wife and child. The seamstress asks to hold the hand of the \"brave stranger\" as they ride to the guillotine. Meanwhile, the Manettes and Mr. Lorry are going through the checkpoints out of town. Anxiously, they watch as guards check and re-check all their papers. Soon, however, the carriage is flying out of Paris. When they get out to a village, they're stopped again. Nervous, Mr. Lorry asks what the holdup is. It turns out that the guards just want to know how many people are being fed to La Guillotine today. The answer is fifty-two. Satisfied, the guards let the carriage roll off into the night.", "analysis": ""}
