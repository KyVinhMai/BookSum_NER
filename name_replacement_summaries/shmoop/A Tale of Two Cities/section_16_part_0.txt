Sydney Carton is working. Stryver is drinking. He's so happy about drinking, in fact, that he asks Carton to make another bowl of punch for the two of them. He has news. Stryver, it seems, has decided to marry. Carton knows Stryver pretty well. He asks if the woman has money. Stryver takes Carton to task for being such a cynic. He's actually fallen in love this time. In fact, Stryver's a bit worried that Carton won't like his choice of a bride. Once upon a time, Carton spoke slightingly of the woman whom Stryver has decided to make his bride. Carton starts a little bit. Could Stryver mean.... Yes. Stryver means to marry Lucie. Apparently, Stryver's willing to overlook her poverty. He's pretty magnanimous about the whole thing. Lucie will benefit a lot from the marriage, he thinks, but he's willing to take her, anyway. We just want to put our opinion on the record: Stryver's a pompous fool. Carton thinks so, too. While Stryver tells Carton about his plans, he also tries to dispense some free advice on how he thinks Carton should lead his own life. Perhaps Carton could find someone like...well, Lucie to marry. Lucie? Carton jumps uncomfortably. Stryver continues to offer unwelcome advice about Carton's love life. Luckily, Carton chooses to ignore him.", "analysis": ""}
