He starts plotting his revenge, but, if you ask us, he really shouldn't bother: Dimmesdale is torturing himself enough for the both of them. Dimmesdale can tell something is wrong with the guy, but he figures that his intuition isn't trustworthy because he himself is such a big sinner. His entire congregation venerates him, but he just cannot deal. Even when he tells them how vile he is, they don't believe him. More than once, he's gone up to the pulpit resolved to confess, but he keeps chickening out. Basically, he sickens himself. Instead of confessing, Dimmesdale commits acts of penance like beating himself mercilessly all night in a secret room. It's a lot less fun than it sounds. But no matter how hard he beats himself, he can't purify the sin. Night after night, he has visions of Hester Prynne, pointing her forefinger at the letter on the bodice of her dress and then at his breast. Okay, apparently we know who the father of her baby is now. And then he has an idea. He gets up from his chair and leaves the house, going out into the night.", "analysis": ""}
