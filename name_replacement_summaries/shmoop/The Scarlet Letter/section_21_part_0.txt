Even Hester comes into town. Like always, she doesn't give much away--but there just might be a teeny little expression of freedom on her face. Most people wouldn't notice a gorilla wandering onto a basketball court, so they sure don't notice Hester's expression. But Pearl does. Knowing something's up, she's acting wild--but she calms down enough to say that she's a strange, sad man if he'll greet them only at night or in the forest. Hester shushes her and tells her to notice how happy everybody is around them, celebrating Election Sunday . This is essentially the one day of the year that the Puritans seem like all other communities. The commander of the Bristol ship comes to talk to Hester. BTW, he says, there's going to be another passenger from your town. Three guesses? Okay, fine, we'll tell you. It's Chillingworth, obviously.", "analysis": ""}
