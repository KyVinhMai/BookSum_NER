{"name": "Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-12", "summary": "Dimmesdale goes to the scaffold where Hester Prynne had lived through her public ordeal. He stands there just waiting for someone to throw rotten fruit, but no one shows up. He gives a little shriek, trying to rouse people to come shame him, but the only people who stir are Governor Bellingham and his sister. Mistress Hibbins hears him, but the narrator tells us that she probably thinks that it's just her friendly neighborhood witches making a ruckus. Dimmesdale calms down enough to notice that his friend and fellow clergyman Reverend Mr. Wilson is approaching. He's coming from the deathbed of Governor Winthrop, looking all holy and saint-like with the glow of the lamp like a halo surrounding him. He doesn't notice Dimmesdale lurking up on the platform, and Dimmesdale doesn't speak. Dimmesdale imagines what would happen if he were still there in the morning, and he's apparently tickled by imagining his community discovering that their beloved minister is a huge sinner because he busts out laughing. Surprise! Pearl laughs back at him. He calls out and Pearl responds. Hester is also with her. They're heading back from Governor Winthrop's house, where she's measured his body so she can make his burial robe. The two join him on the scaffold. Dimmesdale and Hester are connected through Pearl, as each holds one of her hands. Pearl asks him if he will stand with her and her mother tomorrow at noon. No--but he will stand with them on the judgment day. How comforting, Just then, there's a bright light on the horizon, which is either a meteor or a big, fat symbol. Also looking very symbolic right about now: the minister, with his hand over his heart; Hester Prynne, the scarlet letter on her heart; and Pearl, herself a symbol. Pearl grins a little and points, and Dimmesdale sees what looks like an immense letter A marked out in red light. And then he sees Roger Chillingworth, who Dimmesdale finally notices is looking kind of evil. Pearl and Dimmesdale have a little squabble, which ends with Pearl basically telling them that he sucks for not promising to stand there with her and her mom. Just then, Chillingworth steps forward and gets Dimmesdale to come home with him. The next day, Dimmesdale gives an A+ sermon. As he comes down the pulpit-steps, the sexton hands him a glove, his glove, which the sexton had found on the scaffolding. The sexton's theory? Satan must have dropped it there. By the way, the sexton says, did Dimmesdale see the letter A in the sky last night? It was a portent of the death of Governor Winthrop, surely now an Angel.", "analysis": ""}
