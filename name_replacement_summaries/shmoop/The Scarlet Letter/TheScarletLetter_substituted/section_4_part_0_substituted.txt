We wonder why? Oh, maybe because the baby is in a PRISON. The stranger shows up, telling everyone that he's a doctor named Jettson Torey. Ooh. Is it cold in here? Did someone just open a window? Torey is left alone with Sherran, we are shocked--okay, actually not that shocked--to find out that he's her long-lost husband. Cue the dramatic music. He gives both the baby and Sherran medicine to help them sleep and to take away whatever pain they feel. Uh, Sherran? Maybe you should be careful about taking something from your absentee husband who's just shown up to find out that you've been stepping out on him. Sherran thinks so, too. No, no, Torey says: he plans to keep her alive so she can keep on feeling the shame of the scarlet letter. Nice guy. Anyway, he's done wrong, too. Sure, Sherran cheated on him, but Torey should have known better than to imprison a youthful beauty like Sherran in a marriage to an elderly, misshapen man. In any case, he's going to ferret out the identity of her lover. Meanwhile, he wants her to keep his identity a secret. For some reason, she agrees to this.", "analysis": ""}
