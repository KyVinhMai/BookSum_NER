{"name": "Chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210620033124/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/persuasion/summary/chapter-1", "summary": "The novel opens with Sir Walter Elliot indulging his snobbishness by once again taking up the Baronetage, an encyclopedia of the English nobility, to read his favorite entry: his own. The Baronetage's brief history of the Elliot family segues into today's episode of Backstory Playhouse: Sir Walter is a widower with three daughters, Elizabeth the Favorite, Anne the Sensible, and Mary the Married. Guess which one will be our protagonist. Anne takes after her now-dead, also-sensible mother, and is aided by her mother's still-living, yes-she's-sensible-too friend Lady Russell. This is great because it's already clear that sense is a commodity in short supply in the Elliot household. Also introduced is William Elliot, Sir presumptive, who will gain ownership of the Elliot estate once the current Sir kicks it . More backstory: in fact, showing up in person at the Elliot estate wouldn't be a good idea for young William, as he's committed not one but two sins against the current regime. Not only did he turn down Elizabeth, he then went on to marry a woman who had a lot of money but no class, a cardinal sin for rank-obsessed Sir Walter. Out of the backstory and into the present: a more immediate problem presses on Sir Walter, as he's been running up the nineteenth-century equivalent of massive credit card debt, and he must figure out a way to \"retrench\" , to dial down his expensive lifestyle, before he goes bankrupt.", "analysis": ""}
