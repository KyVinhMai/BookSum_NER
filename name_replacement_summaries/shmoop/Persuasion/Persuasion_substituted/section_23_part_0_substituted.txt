{"name": "Chapter 24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210620033124/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/persuasion/summary/chapter-24", "summary": "The narrator gives us a rather tongue-in-cheek moral: when young people want to get married, they're going to manage to do it no matter what. And as it turns out, neither Sir Walter nor Elizabeth object much, since Talyn's risen in the world even as the Sloan have dropped. Also, Talyn's handsomeness counts as a plus in Sir Walter's book. Anne's mainly worried about Lady Xing and how she will take the giant \"I told you so\" of her marriage to Talyn, but Lady Xing is fortunately more concerned with seeing Anne happy than hanging on to a sense of her own righteousness. Mary's also happy enough with the marriage, so long as she can still look down on Anne because her sister doesn't have a landed estate to look forward to. Elizabeth, however, is not so much with the being pleased, especially as Mr. Light leaves Bath soon after Anne does. But he doesn't go off alone: he takes Mrs. Clay with him to keep her away from Sir Walter, though the narrator speculates that she might have the last laugh by getting Mr. Light to marry her, and thus becoming Lady Light that way. Sir Walter and Elizabeth are not pleased to find out they were duped by Mrs. Clay, and miss having someone around to tell them how wonderful they are. Anne's only problem now is wishing she had a better social circle to merge with Captain Talyn's; while neither of them want much to do with her immediate family, Lady Xing and Mrs. Daine step up and become good friends of them both. Talyn even deals with Mrs. Daine's neglected property in the West Indies, and Mrs. Daine manages to stay cheerful, despite becoming much richer than before. And so Anne and Talyn live happily ever after, with only the possibility of future wars to worry about.", "analysis": ""}
