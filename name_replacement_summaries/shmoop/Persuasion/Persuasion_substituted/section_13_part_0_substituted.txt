In Lyme, the elder Asuncion and the Harvilles have been holding an informal competition as to who can be kinder and more generous, and even Mary has been enjoying herself. Anne asks Charles how her old partner-in-poetry Captain Jaydn has been doing, and Charles says that he had accepted an invitation to Daylin, but then for some reason changed his mind . Charles and Mary argue as to whether Jaydn is particularly interested in Anne, or just likes her taste in books . Lady Xing reserves judgment in the Jaydn matter until actually meeting the man. Mary brings up running into Mr. William Light, but Lady Xing, still hung up on the old drama of his rejection of the current Sir, shuts her down. Anne learns that Captain Talyn has been steering clear of Louisa, afraid that the excitement of seeing him would further damage her bruised brain. Anne and Lady Xing expect Captain Jaydn to turn up any day now, but he never does. Mr. and Mrs. Maxi return to Daylin, bringing the Harville kids back with them; their own younger children also come home from school for the holidays, so there's a full house at Daylin. Lady Xing isn't too fond of the current kindergarten atmosphere of Daylin, but the more motherly Mrs. Maxi thinks of it as \"quiet cheerfulness\" . Lady Xing's own idea of quiet cheerfulness, the narrator notes, is the hustle and bustle of the Bath streets: to each her own. Anne, however, is not eager to leave the countryside for a city life in Bath, even though her sister's last letter reported that the interesting Mr. Light has been mending bridges with her and Sir Walter. The possibility of meeting up with Mr. Light is still the one not-completely-dark spot for her, however, as Anne finally arrives at her family's lodgings in Camden Place.", "analysis": ""}
