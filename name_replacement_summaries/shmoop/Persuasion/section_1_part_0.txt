Sir Walter himself unwittingly suggests the solution: leaving Kellynch Hall for cheaper digs. Anne wants to stay in the neighborhood and hates the town of Bath, so of course Sir Walter decides to leave the neighborhood and settle in...wait for it...Bath! At least Lady Russell is pleased. Lady Russell does have an ulterior motive: Elizabeth has been getting chummy with one Mrs. Clay, and Lady Russell wants to split the pair up before they become BFFs.", "analysis": ""}
