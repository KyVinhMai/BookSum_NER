The good Madame invites Emily to her estates in Tholouse, but Em hopes to put her off for as long as possible. Emily heads over to the old fishing-house to be mopey, and who should she run into but Valancourt. It's a total coincidence that he's wandering around near her house. Emily fills Valancourt in on what happened while he was off traipsing around the country. Valancourt says he's taking off the next day, but will Emily be around tomorrow morning? He sure would like to see her. Emily's down with that, but seeing Valancourt reminds her of her father's death. Time to burn those papers, girl.", "analysis": ""}
