In the meantime, we get to hear one of the stories from his books: it's \"The Provencal Tale,\" all about a noble Baron. The Baron gets a visit from a weird knight who asks him to meet him deep in the woods. Once there, the knight shows the Baron the body of a murdered man. Turns out it's the body of the knight himself, who wants the Baron to give him a proper burial and avenge his death. Nice story. Where's Ludovico again? He's drifting off to sleep, barely noticing that a man's face is staring at him from across the room.", "analysis": ""}
