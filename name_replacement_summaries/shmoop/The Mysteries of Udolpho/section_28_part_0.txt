Once Montoni's out of the way, Madame M. directs Em to some papers she concealed from her rotten husband. Remember, all the lands go straight to Em when her auntie dies. Em watches again for the strange figure and thinks she hears a voice. She demands to know who goes there. Eh, it's just Anthonio, one Montoni's soldiers. Madame M. finally passes away, leaving Em in one big mess with her step-uncle, Montoni.", "analysis": ""}
