This is the kind of breakup that requires a few pints of Ben & Jerry's. Arriving at Tholouse is like taking a trip down memory lane with Valancourt. All Em can think about is the happy times they shared together. Just when she's getting particularly upset, she catches a glimpse of a familiar face on the terrace. It looks like Valancourt, it moves like Valancourt... and she's pretty convinced it is Valancourt. Probably-Valancourt hightails it off of the property before Em can react. Annette is chattering away to Em a few days later when she mentions that the gardener shot a robber in the garden the other night. Em's mind immediately flashes to the worst scenario. Could the \"robber\" be Valancourt? Apparently, the guy made it away without being killed. But there's definitely a track of blood on the ground. Things aren't looking good for guys who hang out in the bushes.", "analysis": ""}
