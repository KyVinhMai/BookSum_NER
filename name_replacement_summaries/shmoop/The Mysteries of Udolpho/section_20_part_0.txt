Last time we saw him, he was all broken-hearted in Tholouse over Em. Well, he's found an interesting way to cope with heartbreak--namely, by partying it up in Paris with a certain Countess Lacleur. Ahem, Valancourt is spending a little more time at the Countess's parties than fulfilling his duties as a soldier. There's also a Marchioness Champfort who seems to be spending plenty of time with Emily's beau. Man, Valancourt is in some trouble. Let's hope he can make it through the temptations and hold out for Em.", "analysis": ""}
