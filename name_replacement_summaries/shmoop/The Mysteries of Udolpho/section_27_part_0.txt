Big surprise. Em hears a band of men coming back to the castle, bragging about all the plunder they took from neighboring castle. Something tells us this won't end well. Always big on jumping to conclusions, Em assumes Montoni is a captain of robbers. Well, the narrator tells us, she's not that far off. Quickie historical context from the narrator: since Italy didn't have enough moolah to support its armies, some ex-soldiers turned to robbery. Some of them even turned outlaw and took over fortresses where they could stash their ill-gotten cash. These folks are called the Condittieri. Anyway, Em listens again at night for the strange music. No luck, though. Finally, Em has a meeting with Montoni. He's with several of his officers and won't dismiss them. Em wants to leave the castle, but Montoni forbids it. Em lets it slip that she thinks Madame M. is dead. Montoni tells Em her aunt is alive, if not totally well. He gives her permission to go see her in the east turret. Meanwhile, you could cut the tension with a knife among Montoni and his officers. Verezzi wants Orsino gone pronto. The two guys start fighting after Em leaves the room. Em visits Madame M., who is not in fact dead. But she's actually pretty close to dying. Remember that body Em saw? Yeah, it was someone who died during the fray in the castle. So Em goes to work persuading Montoni to move her sick aunt out of the east turret. She gets lucky and succeeds, then goes to work taking care of her dear auntie. The same night, Em sees the human form again. She's not crazy, either, because the watchmen of the castle also see a strange figure wandering about.", "analysis": ""}
