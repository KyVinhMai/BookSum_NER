St. Aubert is taking it pretty hard. He shuts himself up in his room for a little bit, but emerges in time to tell Emily to cheer up, Charlie. M. Barreaux comes to offer his condolences to the family, like a good neighbor. St. Aubert's sister, Madame Cheron, also makes a brief visit, but she doesn't really get why everyone is so devastated. St. Aubert has some business to take care of with the Quesnels, so he pays the lovely couple a visit in Epourville. Emily tags along for the ride and meets two Italian gentlemen: Montoni, a distant relative of Madame Quesnel, and Signor Cavigni, a buddy of Montoni's. Montoni is super into politics and French fashion, but Emily's a total noob who knows nothing about culture. She keeps quiet at the dinner table. Back to La Vallee, but only for a little bit. St. Aubert's doc sees that he's unwell and orders him to travel around the countryside to get better. St. Aubert, who's your doc and what's his number? While Emily's getting ready to go traveling with her dad, she spots him crying over some papers in his office. And we mean really sobbing. Emily's about to stop spying on her dad, but not before she notices him gazing at a picture of a woman who is definitely not her mom. Hoo-boy.", "analysis": ""}
