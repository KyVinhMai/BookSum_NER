The group starts to travel once more. Man, St. Aubert really likes Valancourt. He's also no dummy: he sees Valancourt and Emily acting all lovey-dovey toward each other. This makes St. Aubert think about how rarely nature and simplicity are appreciated in this world. The group comes across a shepherd's cabin with a couple of little kids playing around it. No parents, though. Then the mom of the kids arrives. She's looking pretty down in the dumps, so the travelers ask her what's wrong. Apparently, a gang of gypsies drove away some sheep belonging to her husband's master. The husband is now on the hook for paying for the lost sheep. Oopsie-daisies! Valancourt's a good guy. Even though he's not exactly Mr. Money-Bags, he throws down his remaining money to replace the lost sheep. St. Aubert is impressed. He praises Valancourt for doing the right thing. The group continues on to Rousillon, but Emily's imagination is running a little wild. She sees hieroglyphics on a rock that tell a dreadful story, but she keeps mum because she doesn't want to scare anyone else. Emily likes to tease the reader a little bit. Valancourt and the St. Auberts plan to split up again, as the St. Auberts continue on to Languedoc and Valancourt heads home. It's kind of a bummer for both Emily and St. Aubert that their companion is going to leave, but they try to stay cheerful.", "analysis": ""}
