Barnardine takes her through the castle and tells her to hold on a sec: he has to make sure Madame Montoni wants to see her. While waiting for Barnardine to check, Em examines the chamber she's been left in. She sees what look like torture devices and a dark curtain drawn across part of the room. Scary stuff. Of course, our favorite gal can't help but peek behind the curtain. Ugh, there's a bloodied body. Em passes out faster than a speeding bullet. She wakes up to Barnardine and some strange men carrying her to a horse. Count Morano is up to his usual tricks, it seems. But wait--Annette brings Montoni and others from the castle to intercept the second attempted kidnapping. There's a scuffle, but Em is brought back into the castle. She's so shocked that she makes crazy eyes at Annette and scares the bejeebies out of her. Montoni tries to interrogate Em on what happened, but all she can say is \"Yes.\" She cries herself to sleep.", "analysis": ""}
