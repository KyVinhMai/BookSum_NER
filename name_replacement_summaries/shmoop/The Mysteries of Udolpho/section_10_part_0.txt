Auntie Cheron doesn't even stop the carriage to let Em say goodbye to her father's pensioners. FYI, pensioners are people who were given a sum of money by St. Aubert. Valancourt returns back home to Estuviere brokenhearted. He's more than a little worried about getting Madame Cheron on his side. See, Valancourt's a younger brother. That means he gets to inherit squat. Luckily, his older brother thinks he can make some much-needed cash by joining the military. Meanwhile, at Tholouse, Madame Cheron is really giving Emily the business about Valancourt. Emily can't believe this is really her father's sister. Madame Cheron is such a jerk. Madame Cheron's estates are pretty and all, but in a tacky way. Her number-one goal is to show off her wealth. Once Emily is alone in her room at Tholouse, out come the waterworks. At least she's got her dog, Manchon, who is her only friend. Woe is her. Emily remembers her dad's warning about not indulging her emotions. Whoops.", "analysis": ""}
