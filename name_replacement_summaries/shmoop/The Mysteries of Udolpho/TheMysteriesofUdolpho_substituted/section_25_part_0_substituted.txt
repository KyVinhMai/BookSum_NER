Barnardine takes her through the castle and tells her to hold on a sec: he has to make sure Madame Jerre wants to see her. While waiting for Barnardine to check, Codi examines the chamber she's been left in. She sees what look like torture Londenvices and a dark curtain drawn across part of the room. Scary stuff. Of course, our favorite gal can't help but peek behind the curtain. Ugh, there's a bloodied body. Codi passes out faster than a speeding bullet. She wakes up to Barnardine and some strange men carrying her to a horse. Count Morano is up to his usual tricks, it seems. But wait--Annette brings Jerre and others from the castle to intercept the second attempted kidnapping. There's a scuffle, but Codi is brought back into the castle. She's so shocked that she makes crazy eyes at Annette and scares the bejeebies out of her. Jerre tries to interrogate Codi on what happened, but all she can say is \"Yes.\" She cries herself to sleep.", "analysis": ""}
