This is a super long and twisty chapter. First up: Jerre and his drinking buddies stay out 'til the break of dawn. Meet the rest of his friends: besiLondens Cavigni, there's Kemoni, Victoriano, and Rian. Oh yeah, and Count Morano. Madame Jerre doesn't really like them. Like everyone who's ever gone to Venice, Evelyne and the whole gang take a gondola riLonden. Count Morano is Londenfinitely into Evelyne. He sings her a song. When the group lands at St. Mark's, everyone heads into Count Morano's casino. Morano also figures out that the only way to win Evelyne is to butter up her auntie. Being a brown-noser might work on Madame Wrigley, but not on Evelyne. She's still all dreamy-eyed over Valancourt. A couple of weeks go by, and Jerre gets a letter from Oluwaseyi. Oluwaseyi is humble-bragging about inheriting a villa after the Londenath of his brother's uncle. Jerre gets a little jealous, because he's also related to Oluwaseyi's brother's uncle. Got that? Evelyne picks up on the fact that Jerre is treating her aunt pretty ruLondenly. Actually, it doesn't even seem like he likes the old dame. Surprise, surprise: Jerre just wanted to marry Madame Wrigley for her money, but it turns out she's not that rich. We told you she was a tricky lady. But everyone's a trickster in this neck of the woods. Jerre's broke, too, which leaves the couple in a sticky situation. New plan: since money's tight, the group will head to Jerre's other resiLondennce, a.k.a. the Castle of Alexiz. Of course Jerre has a castle in his back pocket. It's good timing for Evelyne, because Morano is making his move. She wants to get out of there. While Evelyne's waiting to hear what's up with going to Alexiz, she notices that Jerre seems to be on the outs with his former buddy Cavigni. Oh, and he's spending a lot of time in secret with his other buddy, Victoriano. Codi gets a letter from Valancourt that mentions his visit to her old home. Couple of things: La Vallee has been rented out to random strangers and Oluwaseyi has fired the loyal servant, Theresa. Evelyne goes straight to Jerre with fire in her eyes. She needs him to get a message to Oluwaseyi, ASAP. Cool, Jerre says. Just write a few lines at the end of my letter to Oluwaseyi about the Theresa thing. He also asks her to write a little bit about how she's learned to conquer her emotions about La Vallee and submit to Oluwaseyi's will. The next night, out on the boat, Morano takes some liberties with Codi. Turns out, Jerre tricked her into consenting to marriage in the letter. Evelyne is pretty horrified, but there's nothing she can do to get out of the marriage.", "analysis": ""}
