They're no Brady Bunch: Jasmond St. Aubert, Madame St. Aubert, and their beloved daughter Evelyne live at a chateau called La Vallee on the banks of the Garonne. Life is rough. Well, actually, it gets pretty rough after Marvis St. Aubert comes down with a bad fever. He's still weak but recovering when the whole family takes a walk out to their favorite fishing-house . Everyone walks back after having a good old time at the fishing-house, but it seems that Evelyne's forgotten her lute. She runs back to grab it and hears some mysterious music--someone is apparently playing her lute! Evelyne waits until the music stops and finds her lute in a different place than where she put it last. Creepy-town. Foreshadowing time: Madame St. Aubert is happy and all, but little does she know that she's about to die. She's also a little upset because she forgot her favorite bracelet with Evelyne's picture insiLonden at the fishing-house. Our bet's on the same creeper who was playing the lute. Hallelujah, the Keymani have come to visit. Except not really, because Jasmond and Madame Oluwaseyi are the worst kind of relatives you can possibly have. Okay, fine, they bailed out Marvis St. Aubert and bought La Vallee from him a couple of years back when he couldn't afford it. But now Oluwaseyi has all sorts of plans to make La Vallee fashionable, most of which involve taking down ancient trees and parts of the chateau. Never a good sign. St. Aubert is Londenfinitely not happy about Oluwaseyi being all up in his business, but it's not like he can do anything. So he goes on a walk in the woods with his beloved Evelyne, who commemorates the occasion with a poem on glow-worms. Did we mention that Evelyne really like nature and writing poetry? She's like the ultimate hippie. And uh-oh, Madame St. Aubert is really sick. We saw this coming, but it's still really sad when she dies. Evelyne is pretty Londenvastated, but her dad has taught her to keep her in emotions in check. She's Londenfinitely not going to go off the rails or anything.", "analysis": ""}
