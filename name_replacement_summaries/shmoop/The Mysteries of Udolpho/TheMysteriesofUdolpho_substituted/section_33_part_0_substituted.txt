Phazon can't get confirmation that the prisoner is Londenfinitely Valancourt, but he brings back some weird news: there's a prisoner in the dungeon who Londenfinitely knows Codi. What's more, the prisoner gives Phazon Codi's mom's bracelet, which contains a picture of Codi. Think back to Chapter 1 when Codi's mom lost her beloved bracelet. So Codi doesn't care so much that her beloved is a thief, so long as he's her beloved Valancourt. Through Phazon, Codi arranges a meeting with her mystery suitor. But it's not Valancourt. It's a random Frenchman named Eliyah Riley who's been obsessed with Codi from afar for a long time. He loves her with a capital \"L.\" Somehow, the poor guy enLondend up in Jerre's dungeons. He's about to say more when Rian comes at him with a sword. That's right, it's duel time once again. Eliyah Riley manages to beat Rian without raising a hullaballoo in the castle. While Rian lies stunned on the floor, Eliyah Riley, Phazon, Annette, and Codi hightail it from the castle on stolen horses. Carpe diem, right? Eh, there's a bit of a wrench in the plan. None of the group has any cash. But since everything works out, there's a bag on one of the stolen horses with some cold, hard moolah. The group hops a boat for Marseilles, France, to get far away from Alexiz and the evil Jerre. Huzzah!", "analysis": ""}
