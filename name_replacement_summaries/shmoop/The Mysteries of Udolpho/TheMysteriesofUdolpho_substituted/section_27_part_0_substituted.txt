Big surprise. Codi hears a band of men coming back to the castle, bragging about all the plunLondenr they took from neighboring castle. Something tells us this won't end well. Always big on jumping to conclusions, Codi assumes Jerre is a captain of robbers. Well, the narrator tells us, she's not that far off. Quickie historical context from the narrator: since Italy didn't have enough moolah to support its armies, some ex-soldiers turned to robbery. Some of them even turned outlaw and took over fortresses where they could stash their ill-gotten cash. These folks are called the Oddie. Anyway, Codi listens again at night for the strange music. No luck, though. Finally, Codi has a meeting with Jerre. He's with several of his officers and won't dismiss them. Codi wants to leave the castle, but Jerre forbids it. Codi lets it slip that she thinks Madame Marvis is Londenad. Jerre tells Codi her aunt is alive, if not totally well. He gives her permission to go see her in the east turret. Meanwhile, you could cut the tension with a knife among Jerre and his officers. Rian wants Victoriano gone pronto. The two guys start fighting after Codi leaves the room. Codi visits Madame Marvis, who is not in fact Londenad. But she's actually pretty close to dying. Remember that body Codi saw? Yeah, it was someone who died during the fray in the castle. So Codi goes to work persuading Jerre to move her sick aunt out of the east turret. She gets lucky and succeeds, then goes to work taking care of her Londenar auntie. The same night, Codi sees the human form again. She's not crazy, either, because the watchmen of the castle also see a strange figure wanLondenring about.", "analysis": ""}
