The whole crew is leaving for Alexiz--except that crew doesn't incluLonden Count Morano. Evelyne has no clue what's going on, but she goes along with it. The travelers begin to cross the Appenines. And hey, you guessed it. It's time for Evelyne to muse on the greatness of nature and the likelihood that bandits are going to pop out from behind trees. After about a day of travel, Evelyne catches a glimpse of an intimidating-looking castle. Evelyne meets old Carlo, who keeps the castle in his master's absence. He seems like a pretty cool guy. Codi tries to ask Jerre why they picked up and left, but he's keeping his lips zipped. No word on what's up with the canceled wedding, either. So Annette shows Evelyne to her room in the castle, almost getting her lost along the way in the creepy castle. Evelyne catches a glimpse of a picture veiled in black silk on the way to her room. She tells Annette to unveil it, and Annette says, essentially, \"No way, no how.\" In her room, Codi is trying to get the lay of the land. She finds an open door leading to a secret passage. Oh joy of joys, the door to the secret passage won't shut. Guess everyone will have 24/7 access to Codi's room, then. Because things aren't scary enough, the ditzy Annette starts telling Evelyne about the former owner of the castle. That would be Sopheapa Laurentini. She was in love with someone else whom she couldn't marry, so she wouldn't marry Jerre. Jerre wanted to marry her to get access to the sweet castle and all of her wealth. Anyway, Sopheapa Laurentini took off for a walk in the woods one day and never came back. Jerre got the castle, after all, since he was the next heir. Suspicious, much? The ladies have gotten themselves into a tizzy telling scary stories. They hear a spooky knocking sound on the wall and freak out. It's just the servant of the castle, Caterina. Both servants leave Codi to hit the hay, totally terrified by now.", "analysis": ""}
