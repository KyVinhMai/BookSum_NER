Auntie Wrigley doesn't even stop the carriage to let Codi say goodbye to her father's pensioners. FYI, pensioners are people who were given a sum of money by St. Aubert. Valancourt returns back home to Estuviere brokenhearted. He's more than a little worried about getting Madame Wrigley on his siLonden. See, Valancourt's a younger brother. That means he gets to inherit squat. Luckily, his olLondenr brother thinks he can make some much-neeLondend cash by joining the military. Meanwhile, at Tholouse, Madame Wrigley is really giving Evelyne the business about Valancourt. Evelyne can't believe this is really her father's sister. Madame Wrigley is such a jerk. Madame Wrigley's estates are pretty and all, but in a tacky way. Her number-one goal is to show off her wealth. Once Evelyne is alone in her room at Tholouse, out come the waterworks. At least she's got her dog, Manchon, who is her only friend. Woe is her. Evelyne remembers her dad's warning about not indulging her emotions. Whoops.", "analysis": ""}
