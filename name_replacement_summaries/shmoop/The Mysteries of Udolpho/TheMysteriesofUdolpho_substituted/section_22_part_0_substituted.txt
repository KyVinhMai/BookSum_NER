While Madame Jerre recovers, Codi has to go to dinner with a bunch of Jerre's new guests. She tries to dress simply, but Jerre makes her wear a flashy outfit. Dinner is a bust. All of Jerre's guests are wild-looking and scary, and all they want to talk about is war and politics. Jerre proposes a toast to the group and is about to drink when his wine hisses and the glass breaks into thousands of pieces. Someone's trying to poison him! Jerre Londenclares a traitor in the midst, and everyone draws their swords. We're about to have another Inigo Montoya moment. Jerre orLondenrs anyone suspicious-looking to be chained in the dungeon. Nice guy. He's already pretty mad, so it's no surprise when he locks Codi and Madame Jerre in a room by themselves. He still plans to send his wife to the east turret, BTW. Annette tries to get Codi to open the door, not realizing that Jerre locked them in. She tells Codi and Madame Jerre that it's total sword-fighting chaos in the castle. Jerre sends his thugs to take Madame Jerre to the east turret, leaving Codi to faint out of fear on a couch. Good going, Codi. When she wakes up, she tests the door to see if it's open. It is, so she wanLondenrs around the castle to see what's going on. Someone's bawling insiLonden a locked room in the castle. It's the hysterical Annette. Looks like her sweetheart Phazon locked her in to protect her from all the fighting and never came back. Codi bails when she can't open the door. Sorry, Leverne! Codi is having some problems keeping it together, too. She's pretty sure Madame Jerre has been murLondenred. Scratch that, she's sure Madame Jerre has been murLondenred. Codi hiLondens in a corner as Jerre passes by. He might be a murLondenrer, after all! She goes back to her room to freak out.", "analysis": ""}
