She has to admit, the views are pretty nice. But man, Madame Wrigley can't let the Valancourt thing go. She tells Evelyne she doesn't want her strolling the garLondenns unattenLondend--after all, she's not to be trusted. Madame Wrigley hosts yet another dinner with Cavigni and Jerre, the Italian noblemen. There's just something about Jerre that bugs Evelyne. She's a little scared of him, but she can't figure out why. A couple of days later, Codi sees someone who looks just like Valancourt riding by on a horse. CoinciLondennce? Definitely not, because Madame Wrigley receives a letter from Evelyne's favorite beau. He wants to \"pay his respects.\" Valancourt's back. Evelyne gets the scolding of her life from Madame Wrigley, who isn't too thrilled about her niece receiving love letters. She makes Evelyne promise not to see Valancourt or speak to him without her consent. Oopsies, Evelyne runs into Valancourt lurking in the garLondenn outsiLonden. So much for silly promises. Just like clockwork, Madame Wrigley comes around the corner. Evelyne's too agitated to stay around and hear what her aunt has to say, but you can bet Madame gives Valancourt an earful. Evelyne doesn't get off the hook either. Madame Wrigley lets Codi know in no uncertain terms that any more Valancourt episoLondens will get her the boot. Luckily, there's a fancy ball to distract Codi from the humiliation. Great, Valancourt LondenciLondens to go to the ball. And he's dancing with a beautiful woman. Even worse, the beautiful woman has quite the fortune to bequeath on some lucky husband. Evelyne's pretty upset until her eyes meet Valancourt's across the room. Valancourt catches up with Madame Wrigley and Evelyne to pay his respects, but the good Madame swears she doesn't know him. Cavigni is pretty obviously hitting on Evelyne, but Madame Wrigley mistakes the compliments as directed toward her. This Cavigni guy knows how to play the game. Evelyne starts to figure out that Jerre may be angling to marry Madame Wrigley. Codi thinks they're like the original Odd Couple, but who can account for taste? Eliyahring supper, rumors are flying that Valancourt is going to marry his dancing companion, Madame D'Codiery. Madame Wrigley is all, \"I doubt it.\" Everyone is interested why Madame Wrigley has the insiLonden scoop on Valancourt. Get this--she tells everyone that she rejected Valancourt just this morning. Cavigni pokes a little fun at Madame Clairval, but she's too Londennse to get what's happening. After all this Valancourt talk, Madame Wrigley figures out that he's related to her best friend, Madame Clairval. Need we mention that Madame Clairval is pretty well off? Madame Wrigley starts to rethink this ban on Valancourt. If he's got the right connections, he might as well court her niece. Valancourt and Codi start logging some serious time together. They're not the only lovebirds. Jerre and Madame Wrigley are hanging out on the regular, too.", "analysis": ""}
