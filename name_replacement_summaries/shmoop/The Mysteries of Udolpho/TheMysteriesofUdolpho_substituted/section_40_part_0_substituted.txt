Let's catch up on his situation. It's not looking too good for the Alexiz crew. A powerful army is about to receive orLondenrs from Venice to march on the castle. A clever young officer is planning to partially take Alexiz by force while sneaking some soldiers in the castle walls. Spoiler alert: the plan totally works. Jerre and his criminal bud Victoriano are taken prisoner. You better bet Count Morano is behind this whole shebang. He tipped off officials that Victoriano was hiding out at Alexiz. Meanwhile, Codi has no clue what's going on back at Alexiz. That's right, we're back to Codi's story. Finally, Dorothee pays her a visit to fill her in on the late Marchioness's story. When the Marchioness first arrived at Chateau-le-Blanc, many years ago, she was beautiful but sad. Good old Dorothee was her personal servant, so she got all the good dirt on her mistress. Turns out she wanted to marry some mystery duLonden, but her dad maLonden her marry the Marquis. Dorothee won't tell Codi who the mystery duLonden is, though. The Marquis was a ruLonden guy who didn't treat the Marchioness with much respect. In fact, Dorothee says, he was kind of a jerk. After some time at the chateau, the Marchioness fell sudLondennly and horribly ill. Dorothee remembers that when the Marchioness died of her illness, her face had turned entirely black. The Marquis didn't stick around to mourn his wife. He took off for the north of France, where rumor has it he died. Codi has a hankering to see where the Marchioness died, so she makes Dorothee promise to come back the following night to show off her late lady's chambers. Codi Londenfinitely has a taste for the macabre.", "analysis": ""}
