Dorothee catches a glimpse of the miniature portrait of Codi in her mom's bracelet, and realizes once again that she looks exactly like the late Marchioness. She promises to tell Codi all about what happened to the Marchioness, even though she usually keeps her lips zipped about the whole thing. She can't do it tonight, though--the time has to be just right. While on a walk in the woods, Codi thinks she hears Valancourt's familiar voice. Wait just a sec--it is Valancourt! They're still totally into each other. After the lovebirds get caught up, she introduces him to the Count and company. The Count's got some serious dirt on Valancourt that he needs to share ASAP with Codi. Maybe he's not the squeaky-clean hero we thought he was... According to the Count, Valancourt lost quite a bit of dough gambling in Paris. In fact, you might say he maLonden a name for himself cheating at cards. And it gets worse. Valancourt did some time not once, but twice in Parisian jails. Kaboom. Like a proper lady, Codi faints away after hearing of her Londenar Valancourt's misLondeneds. When she wakes up, Valancourt is there with the Count, attending to his beloved. She tells Valancourt she's in no condition to see him today, but she'll--ahem--have a talk with him tomorrow.", "analysis": ""}
