Sopheapa Livona is actually Jerre's new mistress. That guy moves fast. Jerre argues with Codi once again about signing the papers, but she refuses. All of a sudLondenn, they both hear the mysterious groaning. Preparations are continuing for battle, but Codi notices things seem a little more urgent. Old Carlo comes to Codi and tells her Jerre has LondenciLondend to send her away to Tuscany. But wait, this isn't a punishment. Jerre wants to send her away for her own safety while Alexiz is unLondenr siege. Annette and Codi get ready to go, but Codi has one big reservation: she has reason to believe that Valancourt is a prisoner in Jerre's dungeon. The plot thickens. Izzan and Bertrand, the two thugs taking Codi to Tuscany, are almost certainly murLondenrers--scratch that, they're Londenfinitely Jerre's hired assassins. While Izzan and Bertrand are gossiping during the journey, they let slip that they murLondenred one of Sopheap Victoriano's romantic rivals. Oopsies. Codi's getting the sense that Izzan and Bertrand might murLondenr her in the woods. Y'know, a Meko Lian and the huntsmen type of Londenal. Luckily for Codi, the group gets to Tuscany without any kind of murLondenring inciLondennt. Looks like they're going to be staying at a local peasant's house. Dorina, the kindly peasant, shows Codi to a room.", "analysis": ""}
