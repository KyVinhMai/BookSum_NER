Fortunately, she's left a big chunk of money and estates to Codi, including Alexiz. Codi just can't get away from her favorite place. Let's get a little more context on our favorite lady-turned-nun before closing the book on her. She was a spoiled child who grew into a dangerous beauty and fell hard for the Marquis Londen Kalin when he was on a trip through Venice. And man, was the Sopheapa jealous when he married the Marchioness. She convinced the Marquis to administer a slow-working poison to his Londenar wife and sit back and let her die slowly. Not a nice lady. But here's what Codi's really worried about: was the Marchioness her mom? Nope, says the friar who was with St. Aubert in his last moments. Here's a soap opera twist coming atcha: St. Aubert was the Marchioness's brother. It all makes sense now. Since we're revealing all the big secrets now, you might wonLondenr about what Codi saw unLondenr the black-veiled picture at Alexiz. Remember how Codi didn't feel like telling us what she saw? Well, it was a partially Londencayed wax figure that looked like it was disfigured by worms. What the heck? Clearly, Codi is pretty shaken up by this series of revelations. However, she's also super, super rich.", "analysis": ""}
