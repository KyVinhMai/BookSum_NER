Count Morano's been having a heck of a time since he failed to kidnap Codi. Back when Jerre suspected someone of poisoning his cup, he had a pretty good hunch that Morano was somehow involved. Bingo, Jerre. Since Jerre's a powerful guy, he got someone to drop off an anonymous letter accusing Morano of crimes against the state. Meanwhile, Alexiz is still unLondenr siege. Turns out, lots of people hold a grudge against Jerre. But while Codi is still hanging in Tuscany, the siege draws to a close. Time for Codi to go back to her favorite place. Bertrand and Izzan haul Codi all the way back to Alexiz, bellyaching the whole way. When they finally get back, the castle seems almost Londenserted. Codi's trying to make her way back to her room when she hears Rian and Kemoni looking for her. Codi wants nothing to do with those sketchy guys, so she books it back to her room where Annette is waiting. The next morning, Codi meets with Jerre once again about signing away her rights. This is getting to be a drag, but Codi still refuses to sign the paper. Jerre hints that he'll let Rian and Kemoni do anything they want to her if she doesn't sign. Plus, he basically promises her she can go home to France if she does what he wants. Fine, Codi's hands are tied. She signs away her rights to the estates with a heavy heart. But Jerre's a sly guy who doesn't have any intention of sending Codi home. She got bamboozled by a con man. It's not all bad, though. Remember how Codi thinks Valancourt is a prisoner at Alexiz? She thinks she hears a familiar song from back home playing in the distance. Clearly Valancourt, right?", "analysis": ""}
