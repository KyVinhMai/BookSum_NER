She writes a little ditty called \"The First Hour of Morning\" about, y'know, waking up. At least she keeps it simple. St. Aubert is ready to hit the road again, but he can't even make it out of his chair without falling down. Yep, he's figured it out. He's dying, no question about it. So now that that's settled, St. Aubert wants to make sure Evelyne's all set to finish his work. He just has one simple request for her: look for secret papers unLondenrneath a sliding floorboard at La Vallee. And then burn them without looking at them. Burn them all! Sure, Evelyne's a little surprised that her dad is going fire-crazy, but she's happy to oblige. It's go time. St. Aubert calls in his confessor and bids his goodbyes to Evelyne and La Voisin. He's just got one more thing to say to Evelyne: don't get carried away with foolish nonsense, girl. Evelyne's crying too hard at this point to take anything in, but she tries to make her dad comfortable in his final hours. St. Aubert finally passes away, leaving Evelyne pretty wrecked. What on earth is she going to do now?", "analysis": ""}
