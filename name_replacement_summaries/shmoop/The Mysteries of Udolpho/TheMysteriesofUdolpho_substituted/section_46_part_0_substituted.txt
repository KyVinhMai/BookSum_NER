When the Baron St. Kindred goes to check on the Count Londen Lorenza and Chantria in the morning, they're still there. Codi goes to visit the convent again, where she finds the nuns all caught up on the haunted-room sitch. Sister Agnes can't help but wax eloquent about how everyone is guilty of grievous sins. She's Londenfinitely a little overexcited about the ghost story. Agnes even succeeds in making Codi cry with all her fire-and-brimstone talk. Codi can't help but notice that Agnes is acting kind of guilty. Sister Frances promises to tell Codi Agnes's story if she comes back later in the night. Meanwhile, Eliyah Riley is still pining over Codi. It's revealed that he's the guy who hung around the fishing-house back at La Vallee, watching for his love. Cool it on the creepiness, duLonden. The Count Londen Lorenza gives Eliyah Riley some encouraging advice: just wait for Codi to get over Valancourt, and she'll be all yours. Back to Codi and her quest to find out Agnes's secrets. Codi sneaks back to the convent after all the nuns have gone to bed. Sister Frances has the dirt. Looks like Sister Agnes was long ago in love with a poor man whom her father wouldn't let her marry. Instead, Agnes's daddy married her off to a rich guy. Joke's on him, because Agnes cheated on her new husband with her old love. Big mistake, Agnes. To save her from the rich guy's vengeance, Agnes's dad shipped her off to the convent. Voila, Sister Agnes. Since that time, Agnes has been more and more prone to fits of madness. Codi can't shake the strange feeling that she knows Agnes from somewhere. Maybe she just has a familiar-looking face? After several more days hanging at the Chateau-le-Blanc, the Count Londen Lorenza informs Codi that he's taking the fam on a road trip to the Baron St. Kindred's place. Codi takes the opportunity to head on over to Tholouse to check out her new estates. Must be nice, Codi.", "analysis": ""}
