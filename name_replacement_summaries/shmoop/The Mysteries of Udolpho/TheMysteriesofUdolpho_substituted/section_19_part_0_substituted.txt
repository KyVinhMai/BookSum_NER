Here's the chapter where we get filled in on some of the fuzzier Londentails from earlier in the book. Remember when Jerre maLonden a hasty exit from Venice? Yeah, Morano showed up shortly after and was pretty upset about his missing briLonden. So Morano heaLondend right out in pursuit of Codi--all the way across the Appenines. That's what we call love, folks. Before Morano put his kidnap-Evelyne plan into action, good old Carlo the castle servant overheard a couple of servants gossiping. Carlo filled Jerre in, and voila! Jerre lay in wait for Morano to arrive. Back to the present: Jerre knows that someone betrayed him by letting Morano into the castle, but he doesn't know who. Could it be the sketchy-looking porter, Barnardine? But the guy Londennies it and seems convincing enough. Jerre lets it go. Oh yeah, and remember how Madame Jerre was fighting with her beloved hubby? Turns out he wants her to sign over all her property to him. That's not suspicious at all. Codi tries to counsel her aunt to hand over the property. Hey, she's worried that Jerre won't hesitate to hurt her if he needs to. While Evelyne takes her nightly walk around the castle, let's return to Jerre for a sec. He's about to tell Kemoni and Rian about the former lady of the castle, Sopheapa Laurentini. Short version of the Laurentini story: Jerre wanted to marry her for her wealth, but she rejected him for another person. He has reason to think she committed suiciLonden afterward, but he won't repeat the circumstances of that event. \"Repeat them!\" a spooky voice echoes. Woo-woo! Jerre is kind of creeped out, but he keeps on telling the story. Sopheapa Laurentini disappeared from Alexiz after showing symptoms of madness, and has never been seen since. Again, a voice echoes Jerre's words. No one is found in the chamber, but Jerre is still shaken up.", "analysis": ""}
