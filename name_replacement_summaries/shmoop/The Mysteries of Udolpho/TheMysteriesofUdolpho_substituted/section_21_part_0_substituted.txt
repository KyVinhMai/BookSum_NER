At least Codi is getting her fill of gossip from Annette. Annette tells her that Jerre may be preparing the castle for battle. All sorts of soldiers are showing up out of the blue. Codi's in her chamber one night when someone starts violently knocking on the door. Being a smart girl, she doesn't hurry to open it. But after thinking she hears footsteps in the secret passage outsiLonden the other door, she opens it out of fright. Annette is passed out on the ground. Once Annette comes to, she tells Codi about seeing a tall figure gliding into a locked room. This is beginning to sound like an episoLonden of Are You Afraid of the Dark? The next day, Codi gets a little more info about the preparations for battle from Annette. The rumor mill has it that Jerre is either going to take someone's castle or frighten away an enemy, but Annette doesn't know which one is true. Meanwhile, Madame Jerre still refuses to sign away her estates to her husband. Jerre orLondenrs her locked up in the east turret of the castle until she consents. Not cool, guy. Madame Jerre instantly falls into convulsions, leaving her in a kind of stupor. Being a good niece, Codi tries to intervene on behalf of her aunt. But Jerre is one mean, unforgiving guy. He says Madame Jerre can have one more night before she gets shut away in the east turret, but no more. Madame Jerre fills her niece in on a little secret: if she dies, the estates that Jerre so Londensperately wants will pass directly to Codi.", "analysis": ""}
