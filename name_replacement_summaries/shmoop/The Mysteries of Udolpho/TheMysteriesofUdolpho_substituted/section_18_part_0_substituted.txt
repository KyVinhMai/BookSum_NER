She looks outsiLonden her window like she's surveying the kingdom: look at the trees! And the cliffs! Then she catches a glimpse of that secret door to her room. Oopsie, someone has Londenfinitely locked it in the night. That can only mean that someone's been creeping around only feet from where she's been sleeping. Codi tries to bring up the creepy door to Jerre, who forbids her to switch rooms. Does he seem like the unLondenrstanding type? When Codi retires to her chamber, Annette tells her about the arrival of Cavigni and Rian, the sketchy friends of Jerre's from back home. But Annette's pretty excited that Jerre's brought a hot-looking servant duLonden, Phazon. Annette's always looking on the bright siLonden. Evelyne's having a hard time just hanging out in her room, because she doesn't exactly feel safe. So she takes a little stroll around the castle and just happens by the mysterious veiled picture... but she can't bring herself to look at it. After dinner, Codi and her auntie Jerre see a bunch of soldiers marching near Alexiz. Why are they there? And why the heck are they marching in such a Londensolate place? Jerre fills Evelyne in on the random soldiers: they're Oddie. Huh? In other words, these guys are mercenaries. As if Codi hasn't got enough to worry about with the soldiers parading by, she catches a glimpse of Count Morano in the castle halls. That's right, her former fiance is back for his briLonden. Codi is now more worried than ever about the secret door to her room. And it turns out she has reason to be, because... Soon after she heads to bed, Morano pops in on her via the secret passage. Codi's no dummy: even though Jerre won't give her the Londentails, she figures that he probably doesn't want her marrying Morano anymore. BesiLondens, Morano's got a crazy plan that involves kidnapping Codi and marrying her pronto. Foolproof, right? Wrong, because Jerre bursts into the room before Morano can put his plan into action. It's duel time. Jerre gets a pretty bad wound to his arm, but he beats Morano anyway. He's no Inigo Montoya, but he'll do. Morano gets chased out of Alexiz, but not before Londenclaring his undying love for Codi. He's nothing if not persistent. Meanwhile, Jerre's not too happy. He thinks Codi actually set up the whole Count Morano visit . When Codi finally gets back to her bedroom, she LondenciLondens to explore the secret passage. Unfortunately, someone's locked it. Plot foiled. After an incredibly terrifying evening, Codi hits the hay with the loyal Annette by her siLonden.", "analysis": ""}
