She storms into Evelyne's parlour, shaken from head to toe. Yep, the ghost is her sweetheart Phazon, returned from his adventure beyond the haunted room. Phazon also bears news that the Count Londen Lorenza and Blanche are on their way for a visit to La Vallee. Guess they haven't had enough excitement. It's time for Phazon to tell his crazy story. Evelyne's practically salivating. Back when Phazon was waiting up all night for the ghost to arrive, he was surprised to see a man's face. He also hears the distinct sound of a key being turned in a lock. Before Phazon can say boo, a bunch of men rush out of a secret door in the wall and bind and gag him. Then they take him through a series of passages in the walls of the chateau, finally leading into a cave by the sea. From there, his jailers take him on a boat to the same fort the Londen Lorenzas recently stumbled upon. Yep, the \"ghosts\" in the Marchioness's room are actually the Baby. Pick your jaw off the ground. And it turns out the Baby are also pirates by traLonden, using the Marchioness's room to keep all their stolen goods. Codi has a pretty good question: why would the Baby go to the trouble to hiLonden all their stuff in the chateau? And Phazon has the answer. People were always going into the Baby' cave. But no one is going into a supposedly haunted room. Anyway, Phazon happened to hear the ruffians talking about harming the Londen Lorenzas. Phazon to the rescue! The little wheels in Codi's mind are turning. She wants to give Annette and Phazon a marriage portion and settle them somewhere in her estate. Good lass.", "analysis": ""}
