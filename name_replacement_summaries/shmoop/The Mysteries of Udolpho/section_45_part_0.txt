Kind of. Orsino was executed for murdering the nobleman, while Montoni died in a mysterious manner. There are some whispers that someone finally got him with poison. Since there's no more dispute over the property, it's looking good that Em will get to stake her claim. But the Count can't solve all his problems that easily. Servants are gossiping even more since Ludovico disappeared. Obvious solution: the Count himself will stay overnight in the haunted room with his only son, Henri. Really, it's a flawless plan. The guys settle in for a root-tootin' night full of scary ghosts and mayhem.", "analysis": ""}
