That would be Orsino, otherwise known as the outlaw who killed a guy in Venice. Yup. Montoni is harboring a fugitive. But what Em really wants to know is where that strange music is coming from. She asks Annette about musicians in the castle, but gets nada. Annette does have a little tidbit for Em: Barnardine, the castle porter, says he can get Em to see her aunt in the east turret. There's only one catch. Em has to meet Barnardine late at night, totally alone, and he'll take her to see Madame Montoni. Danger, Will Robinson.", "analysis": ""}
