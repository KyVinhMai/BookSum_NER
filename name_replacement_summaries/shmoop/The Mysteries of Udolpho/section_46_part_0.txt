When the Baron St. Foix goes to check on the Count de Villeforte and Henri in the morning, they're still there. Em goes to visit the convent again, where she finds the nuns all caught up on the haunted-room sitch. Sister Agnes can't help but wax eloquent about how everyone is guilty of grievous sins. She's definitely a little overexcited about the ghost story. Agnes even succeeds in making Em cry with all her fire-and-brimstone talk. Em can't help but notice that Agnes is acting kind of guilty. Sister Frances promises to tell Em Agnes's story if she comes back later in the night. Meanwhile, Du Pont is still pining over Em. It's revealed that he's the guy who hung around the fishing-house back at La Vallee, watching for his love. Cool it on the creepiness, dude. The Count de Villeforte gives Du Pont some encouraging advice: just wait for Em to get over Valancourt, and she'll be all yours. Back to Em and her quest to find out Agnes's secrets. Em sneaks back to the convent after all the nuns have gone to bed. Sister Frances has the dirt. Looks like Sister Agnes was long ago in love with a poor man whom her father wouldn't let her marry. Instead, Agnes's daddy married her off to a rich guy. Joke's on him, because Agnes cheated on her new husband with her old love. Big mistake, Agnes. To save her from the rich guy's vengeance, Agnes's dad shipped her off to the convent. Voila, Sister Agnes. Since that time, Agnes has been more and more prone to fits of madness. Em can't shake the strange feeling that she knows Agnes from somewhere. Maybe she just has a familiar-looking face? After several more days hanging at the Chateau-le-Blanc, the Count de Villeforte informs Em that he's taking the fam on a road trip to the Baron St. Foix's place. Em takes the opportunity to head on over to Tholouse to check out her new estates. Must be nice, Em.", "analysis": ""}
