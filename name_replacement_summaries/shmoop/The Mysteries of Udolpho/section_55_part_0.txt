He's a busy guy and all. Plus, his only daughter is getting married to Monsieur St. Foix. One evening, Em's out wandering as she often likes to do. You betcha she runs into Valancourt. Of course, he thinks the Count's already cleared his name. No such luck, Valancourt. Valancourt tells Em all about how he's a stand-up guy, and Em gets all starry-eyed. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes little Valancourts and Ems in a baby carriage! When the two head back to the chateau, the Count is there offer his congrats.
