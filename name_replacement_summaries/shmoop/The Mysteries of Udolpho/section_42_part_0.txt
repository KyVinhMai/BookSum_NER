Luckily, there are some new visitors to distract from the ghost stories. The Baron de Saint Foix and his cute son, the Chevalier St. Foix, show up at the chateau. The Chevalier St. Foix is into Blanche in a big way. It's about time someone besides Em got some attention around here. On a quiet evening when Em takes a walk around the chateau grounds, she hears some more strange music. This girl seems to attract musicians wherever she goes. Em sits and listens for a while, and then retreats back to the castle. Meanwhile, Annette is whipping the servants up into a frenzy about the ghost in the Marchioness's room. The brave Ludovico offers to stay the night in the Marchioness's room to put an end to the rumors for once and all. Maybe he's a proto-Ghost Hunter.", "analysis": ""}
