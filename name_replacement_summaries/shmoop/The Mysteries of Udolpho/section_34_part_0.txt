It's time for a 180 that involves a totally new plot and characters. It all relates back to Em, we promise! So there's this Count de Villeforte guy who inherited the estate of the Marquis de Villeroi. Sound familiar? That's because it's the place Em passed by with her dad way back in the beginning of the book. Think spooky music and peasants who tell them to stay far away. Count de Villeforte's got a whole family coming with him to Chateau-le-Blanc, including his stuck-up wife, the Countess, and his kiddos from a former marriage, Blanche and Henri. The de Villefortes meet old Dorothee at Chateau-le-Blanc, a jittery servant who's been there since the Marquis de Villeroi's time. She's totally got some ghost stories to tell. Blanche is particularly into wandering around the estates and musing about how beautiful everything is. Sound familiar to anyone?", "analysis": ""}
