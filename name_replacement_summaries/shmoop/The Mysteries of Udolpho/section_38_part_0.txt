Valancourt is pretty devastated, but he also admits he isn't worthy of Em. He totally regrets gambling his life savings away in Paris, by the way. Not a good move. Em's completely wrecked. She's so upset that she forgets that old Dorothee is supposed to tell her about the Marchioness. But Dorothee doesn't show, so Em can mope over Valancourt in peace.", "analysis": ""}
