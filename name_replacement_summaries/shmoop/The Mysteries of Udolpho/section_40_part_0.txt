Let's catch up on his situation. It's not looking too good for the Udolpho crew. A powerful army is about to receive orders from Venice to march on the castle. A clever young officer is planning to partially take Udolpho by force while sneaking some soldiers in the castle walls. Spoiler alert: the plan totally works. Montoni and his criminal bud Orsino are taken prisoner. You better bet Count Morano is behind this whole shebang. He tipped off officials that Orsino was hiding out at Udolpho. Meanwhile, Em has no clue what's going on back at Udolpho. That's right, we're back to Em's story. Finally, Dorothee pays her a visit to fill her in on the late Marchioness's story. When the Marchioness first arrived at Chateau-le-Blanc, many years ago, she was beautiful but sad. Good old Dorothee was her personal servant, so she got all the good dirt on her mistress. Turns out she wanted to marry some mystery dude, but her dad made her marry the Marquis. Dorothee won't tell Em who the mystery dude is, though. The Marquis was a rude guy who didn't treat the Marchioness with much respect. In fact, Dorothee says, he was kind of a jerk. After some time at the chateau, the Marchioness fell suddenly and horribly ill. Dorothee remembers that when the Marchioness died of her illness, her face had turned entirely black. The Marquis didn't stick around to mourn his wife. He took off for the north of France, where rumor has it he died. Em has a hankering to see where the Marchioness died, so she makes Dorothee promise to come back the following night to show off her late lady's chambers. Em definitely has a taste for the macabre.", "analysis": ""}
