The group stops briefly in Turin, but Montoni won't let them rest long. Emily notices signs of war everywhere in Milan. Not a pretty sight. After leaving Milan, the group spots a band of soldiers. Looks like they're buddies of Montoni's. These aren't just any soldiers: they're headed up by the famous captain Utaldo, a.k.a. Montoni's buddy. Utaldo and Montoni chat for a bit before the group heads on. Finally, the group gets to Venice. Montoni has a barge that they take along the water to his mansion. It's party time in Venice: at Montoni's gorgeous mansion, dancers and musicians frolic about. That's right, Emily's going to write another poem to commemorate it. She's nothing if not predictable.", "analysis": ""}
