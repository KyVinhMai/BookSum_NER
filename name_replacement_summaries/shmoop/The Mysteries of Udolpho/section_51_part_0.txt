She storms into Emily's parlour, shaken from head to toe. Yep, the ghost is her sweetheart Ludovico, returned from his adventure beyond the haunted room. Ludovico also bears news that the Count de Villeforte and Blanche are on their way for a visit to La Vallee. Guess they haven't had enough excitement. It's time for Ludovico to tell his crazy story. Emily's practically salivating. Back when Ludovico was waiting up all night for the ghost to arrive, he was surprised to see a man's face. He also hears the distinct sound of a key being turned in a lock. Before Ludovico can say boo, a bunch of men rush out of a secret door in the wall and bind and gag him. Then they take him through a series of passages in the walls of the chateau, finally leading into a cave by the sea. From there, his jailers take him on a boat to the same fort the de Villefortes recently stumbled upon. Yep, the \"ghosts\" in the Marchioness's room are actually the Smugglers. Pick your jaw off the ground. And it turns out the Smugglers are also pirates by trade, using the Marchioness's room to keep all their stolen goods. Em has a pretty good question: why would the Smugglers go to the trouble to hide all their stuff in the chateau? And Ludovico has the answer. People were always going into the Smugglers' cave. But no one is going into a supposedly haunted room. Anyway, Ludovico happened to hear the ruffians talking about harming the de Villefortes. Ludovico to the rescue! The little wheels in Em's mind are turning. She wants to give Annette and Ludovico a marriage portion and settle them somewhere in her estate. Good lass.", "analysis": ""}
