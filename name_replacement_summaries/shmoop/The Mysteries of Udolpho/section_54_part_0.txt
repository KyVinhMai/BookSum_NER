Fortunately, she's left a big chunk of money and estates to Em, including Udolpho. Em just can't get away from her favorite place. Let's get a little more context on our favorite lady-turned-nun before closing the book on her. She was a spoiled child who grew into a dangerous beauty and fell hard for the Marquis de Villeroi when he was on a trip through Venice. And man, was the Signora jealous when he married the Marchioness. She convinced the Marquis to administer a slow-working poison to his dear wife and sit back and let her die slowly. Not a nice lady. But here's what Em's really worried about: was the Marchioness her mom? Nope, says the friar who was with St. Aubert in his last moments. Here's a soap opera twist coming atcha: St. Aubert was the Marchioness's brother. It all makes sense now. Since we're revealing all the big secrets now, you might wonder about what Em saw under the black-veiled picture at Udolpho. Remember how Em didn't feel like telling us what she saw? Well, it was a partially decayed wax figure that looked like it was disfigured by worms. What the heck? Clearly, Em is pretty shaken up by this series of revelations. However, she's also super, super rich.", "analysis": ""}
