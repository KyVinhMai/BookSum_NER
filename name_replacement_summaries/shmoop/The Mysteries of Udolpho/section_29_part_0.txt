They bring in a friar from outside the castle walls. Montoni tries to get Em to sign the papers using some Class A trickery, but Em is too smart for him. When she refuses to sign, Montoni tells her to watch out: she speaks like a heroine, but can she suffer like a heroine? Muahahaha. Signora Livona and some of Montoni's other lady friends arrive from Venice, and Em notices they might not be the classiest of ladies. Going back to her chamber, Em notices a tall figure following her. It's one of Montoni's buds. He tries to kiss Em, who realizes that Montoni may have sent him to make good on his promise. When she finally gets back to her chamber, she hears the mysterious music again. Em decides to talk to the anonymous musician. She yells, \"Hey, is that music from Gascony?\" No answer.", "analysis": ""}
