They don't know for certain that he's dead, but they're pretty sure. Em even admits that she's still kind of in love with the guy. Just on cue, in walks Valancourt. The guy's got good timing, we'll give him that. His arm's in a sling from being shot, but he's alive. That's what you get for lurking, Valancourt. Theresa can't help spilling the beans that Em's still in love with him, but Em refuses to admit it. It turns out he was hanging out at a surgeon's, getting his arm treated for a while.", "analysis": ""}
