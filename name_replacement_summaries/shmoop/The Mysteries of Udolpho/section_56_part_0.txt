Soon after all the celebrating goes down, Em and Valancourt zip back to La Vallee to start their married life together. Valancourt's brother likes Em so much that he gives him part of his estates. Nice. Em gives Annette a hefty chunk of moolah to settle down with Ludovico. Oh yeah, and Em gives away Udolpho to the Bonnacs. We didn't know Em was that tight with the guy Valancourt helped out of prison, but maybe she wanted the creepy castle out of her hair. Everyone is happy, happy, happy. Let's shut this thing down before a ghost pops up somewhere.", "analysis": ""}
