Sounds like our idea of fun. Dorothee shows Em where she last saw the Marchioness's corpse, resting on an elaborate bed. She also shows Em a picture of her late mistress, who really is the spitting image of Em. Em thinks she sees a figure glide by, but she figures it's a mistake. Right? The ladies see a human figure rising by the bed. No mistake, this place is haunted! There's lots of screaming and flailing about, but Dorothee and Em get the heck out of dodge.", "analysis": ""}
