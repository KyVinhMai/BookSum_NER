No one can figure out how that's possible, since the room was locked. After about a week, Ludovico is still missing and the mystery remains unsolved. Back to regular castle activity. Du Pont is still hanging around Emily like a lovesick puppy dog, but she's not remotely over Valancourt. Tough luck, buddy. Em goes to visit her old friends at the abbey. You know, the one she stayed at right after her dad's death. While Em is talking to the nuns about the mysterious circumstances of the Marchioness's death, a crazy nun named Agnes keeps piping up. The other nuns tell Em that Agnes is a bit wacky. She can't stop talking about sins and the purgatory of life.", "analysis": ""}
