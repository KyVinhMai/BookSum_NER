Signora Livona is actually Montoni's new mistress. That guy moves fast. Montoni argues with Em once again about signing the papers, but she refuses. All of a sudden, they both hear the mysterious groaning. Preparations are continuing for battle, but Em notices things seem a little more urgent. Old Carlo comes to Em and tells her Montoni has decided to send her away to Tuscany. But wait, this isn't a punishment. Montoni wants to send her away for her own safety while Udolpho is under siege. Annette and Em get ready to go, but Em has one big reservation: she has reason to believe that Valancourt is a prisoner in Montoni's dungeon. The plot thickens. Ugo and Bertrand, the two thugs taking Em to Tuscany, are almost certainly murderers--scratch that, they're definitely Montoni's hired assassins. While Ugo and Bertrand are gossiping during the journey, they let slip that they murdered one of Signor Orsino's romantic rivals. Oopsies. Em's getting the sense that Ugo and Bertrand might murder her in the woods. Y'know, a Snow White and the huntsmen type of deal. Luckily for Em, the group gets to Tuscany without any kind of murdering incident. Looks like they're going to be staying at a local peasant's house. Dorina, the kindly peasant, shows Em to a room.", "analysis": ""}
