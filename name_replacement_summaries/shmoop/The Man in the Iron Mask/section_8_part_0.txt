He then explains that, as leader of the Jesuits, he is convinced that God is using him as an instrument of justice. Aramis explains that he wants the former prisoner to ascend the throne of France. Philippe asks what will happen to his brother, King Louis XIV. Aramis proposes that they simply exchange places. Aramis tells Philippe that there are no dangers, only obstacles. Philippe points out that his conscience may not be so easily appeased. Aramis gives Philippe a choice: a humble life as a private citizen or king of the most powerful country in the world. Aramis tells Philippe that he knows of twenty leagues of quiet country where Philippe can live a humble and rustic life with no dangers. Philippe asks for ten minutes to make his decision.", "analysis": ""}
