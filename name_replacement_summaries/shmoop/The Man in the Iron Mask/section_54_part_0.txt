Mousqueton, , has lost plenty of weight in two days; his clothes hang on his frame. Various friends arrive to hear the reading of the will. D'Artagnan arrives right as the reading is about to begin. He hugs Mousqueton and nods to the guests. Porthos's will first details all of his worldly possessions, then leaves everything to Raoul de Bragelonne, who he considers his son. A tear slides down D'Artagnan's nose. Porthos includes a few stipulations to this bequest, however. He wants D'Artagnan to have whatever D'Artagnan might request, that Aramis receive a pension should he require one, and that Mousqueton receive all forty-seven of his suits of clothing, to be worn in Porthos's memory. Porthos also wills Mousqueton to Raoul, asking that he look out for the servant's happiness. Mousqueton sobs with grief and tries to leave the hall. D'Artagnan offers to take him to Athos's house. The reading of the will is finished and the guests leave. D'Artagnan is left alone to contemplate his friend's last will and testament, which he judges to be admirable. D'Artagnan hears a groan come from an upstairs room, and he is reminded that Mousqueton must be consoled. He goes upstairs to find, in Porthos's room, all his suits of clothes in a giant heap, and Mousqueton on top, kissing the suits. D'Artagnan moves forward into the room and realizes that Mousqueton is dead.", "analysis": ""}
