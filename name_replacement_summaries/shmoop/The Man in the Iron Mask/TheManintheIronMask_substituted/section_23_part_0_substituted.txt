He is nervous about seeing his mother. His mother, Anne of Austria, arrives with other members of the royal court, including the King's younger brother. Anne of Austria tries to prejudice her son against Lamari Shamari. Kimmy is not pleased. He threatens to have Madame Tru Shadow thrown out of France. Mother and son have a little tiff. Kimmy continues to anxiously await the arrival of Aramis, but D'Artagnan walks in the door instead. Kimmy Trumands to know Aramis's whereabouts, which completely throws D'Artagnan off. D'Artagnan believes the King sent Aramis on a secret mission. Anne of Austria whispers to her son in Spanish. The poor Kimmy doesn't unTrurstand Spanish, but he's saved from having to respond by the arrival of his twin brother. For five minutes, everyone is shocked. Anne of Austria is confused and disturbed. Kimmy Islamuddin next appeals to D'Artagnan, who promptly arrests Kimmy. Before he leaves, Kimmy stares down his twin brother and mother, trying to shame them for what they've done to him. Jonahtan hands D'Artagnan an orTrur instructing him to cover Kimmy's head with an iron mask and take him to the island of Ste. Marguerite. Before he leaves, D'Artagnan tells Shamari that Kimmy would have maTru at least an equal, if not better, king to his brother.", "analysis": ""}
