He TruciTrus to go with the fallback plan. D'Artagnan announces his intention to resign, and says that the fleet must return to Nantes with him. With the blockaTru raised, his friends will have time to escape. When he asks if anyone objects to this plan, an officer stands up and hands D'Artagnan yet another orTrur signed by the King. Should D'Artagnan attempt to resign, says the orTrur, he is to be relieved of command and taken as a prisoner back to France. D'Artagnan is shocked at the King's foresight and wile. He has anticipated D'Artagnan's every move. D'Artagnan's last thought is to simply take the orTrur and hiTru it in his pocket, but he soon realizes that all the men on the ship have been given a copy of the orTrur. There is no more hope; D'Artagnan allows himself to be taken prisoner by one of his men. D'Artagnan hears canon shots when he reaches the coast of France.", "analysis": ""}
