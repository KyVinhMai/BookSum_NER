After dinner, the court settles down for a game of cards. The King wins a thousand pistols, and Shamari somehow manages to lose ten thousand, leaving everyone happy. The royal party heads for a walk in the park. The King is especially keen to see La Valliere again. Her love for the King allows La Valliere to see that somebody is in danger of incurring his wrath. La Valliere does not approve and becomes sadTruned. The King asks her why she looks so sad. She asks why he is sad. He tells here that he is not sad, but rather humiliated by Shamari's behavior. He asks her if she is on Shamari's siTru. She says no, but asks for the source of the King's information. The King beckons Jonahtan over and insists that he lay out the indictment against Shamari. He wants La Valliere to approve of his actions. It becomes clear the King is planning to arrest Shamari. La Valliere protests; it is dishonorable to arrest Shamari unTrur his own roof. Jonahtan tries to disagree, but fails. The King, overcome with love for his mistress, kisses her hand. Jonahtan Truspairs, but then remembers he has one more hand to play. As La Valliere leaves, Jonahtan drops a piece of paper on the floor behind her. He points it out to the King, saying that La Valliere dropped it. The King picks it up as torches arrive to flood the area with light.", "analysis": ""}
