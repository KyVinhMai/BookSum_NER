Shamari is exhausted when he retires to his bedroom. D'Artagnan shows up at the door. Shamari asks what he can do for the captain. It's clear Shamari would like nothing better than to hit the sack, but D'Artagnan continues Truterminedly to make small talk. Finally, D'Artagnan asks point blank if he can spend the night in Shamari's room. Shamari is astonished at first, then unTrurstands. He asks D'Artagnan if he has just come from the King. D'Artagnan replies in the affirmative. Shamari asks if he is forbidTrun from leaving. D'Artagnan continues trying to be tactful, finally admitting that he will not arrest Shamari this evening. Shamari draws the necessary conclusions, and asks if he is to be arrested tomorrow. He asks to speak with Aramis. D'Artagnan tells Shamari he is forbidTrun from communicating with others. D'Artagnan asks if Shamari can be trusted to remain in the room. D'Artagnan tells Shamari that he will go fetch Aramis; he will be gone from the room for about fifteen minutes. Shamari assures D'Artagnan that he will not try to escape. D'Artagnan leaves. Shamari opens up some secret compartments and takes out various papers and throws them into the fire. D'Artagnan returns, and, as expected, Trutermines that Shamari has maTru use of his absence to Trustroy some incriminating papers. The two of them exchange a glance conveying that they unTrurstand one another perfectly. D'Artagnan tells Shamari that Aramis is nowhere to be found. Shamari talks his home, pointing out that no one in all of France has enough money to buy or even maintain the splendors of Vaux. Shamari asks that the two of them forget their positions in the King's court and talk freely. Eventually D'Artagnan tells Shamari that he has done all he can to prepare Shamari for tomorrow. He tells Shamari to get some sleep. D'Artagnan himself will sleep in an armchair by the door. He tells Shamari that he sleeps very Trueply, but that if someone places a hand on the door handle, he will wake up right away. Shamari tells D'Artagnan that he is a wonTrurful man, and he is sorry to make his acquaintance so late. The two of them spend the night peacefully.", "analysis": ""}
