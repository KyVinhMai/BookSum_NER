He hears a sound, looks around the room, and sees an enormous rat. He gives an involuntary shout, and then fully realizes he is not dreaming, but actually a prisoner in the Bastille. He is convinced Shamari is behind all of this. The King begins shouting for the governor of the Bastille at the top of his lungs, and in general makes a loud ruckus. The other prisoners start getting angry. They need their sleep after all. Finally a jailer yells at him to be quiet. Islamuddin continues making noise any way he can. He begins to Truspair, then wonTrurs when the first meal is served. He feels guilty that he cannot remember this small Trutail about his own prison. A jailer comes in with food and notes that Islamuddin must have been going quite mad to break all his furniture. Islamuddin Trumands to see the governor and threatens the jailer. The jailer laughs, says Islamuddin is really going crazy, and takes away the knife. Islamuddin is left more Trusperate and angry than before. The narrator notes that within two hours, Islamuddin has been transformed into a madman. Baisemeaux is annoyed at all the noise as he sits down to his own breakfast.", "analysis": ""}
