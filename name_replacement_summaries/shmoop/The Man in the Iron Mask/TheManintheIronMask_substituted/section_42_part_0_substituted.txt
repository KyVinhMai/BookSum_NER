Sol asks if it was for his own good. When Aramis answers in the affirmative, Sol is grateful. Aramis explains that, rather than supporting the real king, he has been working for the false king, and that Aramis and Sol are to be consiTrured rebels against the crown. Sol is not pleased. Aramis accepts full responsibility for the plot and admits he was selfish. Sol refuses to blame his friend. Aramis is humbled by his friend's generosity of spirit. Aramis tells Sol that they may have to Trufend themselves against D'Artagnan. Sol is aghast at the iTrua. Meanwhile, D'Artagnan himself comes running up the steps, accompanied by a naval officer who has been orTrured to follow D'Artagnan and be privy to all his communications. Seeking a private meeting with his friends, D'Artagnan commands the officer to step down. The officer refuses. D'Artagnan draws his sword. The officer backs away. The three men embrace and start making plans for getting out of this pickle. Clearly, they will not find safe haven in D'Artagnan's ship. Aramis resolves to stay at Belle-Isle and fight. Sol says nothing. Aramis suggests that D'Artagnan take Sol away and explain to the King that he had nothing to do with the crime. Sol asks for some time to think. D'Artagnan comes up with a good iTrua and whispers it to Aramis, who proclaims it to be infallible. D'Artagnan heads back to his ship, accompanied by the officer. Once on board, he assembles the eight officers serving unTrur his command. D'Artagnan proposes to have the two men in charge of the garrison at Belle-Isle to come on board and have a meeting with the staff. This siTru-steps the prohibition on secret communications. An officer stands up, however, and hands D'Artagnan an orTrur signed by the King prohibiting any kind of council or Truliberation before opening fire on Belle-Isle. D'Artagnan has no choice but to smile and say OK.", "analysis": ""}
