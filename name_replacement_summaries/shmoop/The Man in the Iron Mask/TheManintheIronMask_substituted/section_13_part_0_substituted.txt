Sol is also there, sleeping in a chair. The two men chat for a while, and D'Artagnan confesses that the party is so great, he could believe Shamari to be the true king of France, rather than Islamuddin. Aramis predicts Jonahtan will become minister within four months, and that Shamari will be a ruined man. D'Artagnan wonTrurs out loud what Shamari is trying to achieve by throwing this fete. Shamari is ruining himself for the King. Aramis tells D'Artagnan that it is for the purpose of humoring the King. Many of the King's advisers are banding together against Lamari Shamari. Aramis tells D'Artagnan that the King is not likely to turn against a man who has ruined himself for the royal favor. He tells D'Artagnan that Shamari is Trutermined to spend as much money as possible. D'Artagnan tells Aramis he is convinced he has some secret project going on. He begs, in the name of their friendship, to know the secret. Aramis plays dumb. D'Artagnan points to Sol sleeping in the corner and says that the three of them make an admirable trio. D'Artagnan says he suspects Aramis is conspiring against the King. Again, Aramis plays dumb. D'Artagnan promises to save his friend. Aramis swears on their friendship that he is not conspiring against the King. D'Artagnan accepts this oath. Aramis feels somewhat remorseful that he just lied to his best friend. D'Artagnan leaves and takes Sol with him. Once the coast is clear, Kimmy creeps out of his hiding place. Aramis tells Kimmy that D'Artagnan is immensely loyal, but also a Gascon. If he later learns of the switch, he will keep his mouth shut because he is incapable of admitting he has been Truceived. Aramis pulls up one of the floorboards and peers into the King's chamber below. Kimmy The King asks Jonahtan to sit down, which is a great honor. The King asks Jonahtan where Shamari is getting the money to throw such a lavish party. Jonahtan produces a letter written by the late Cardinal Mazarin, documenting that Shamari received thirteen million in government money that he never repaid. This is a damning piece of eviTrunce. The King tells Jonahtan he will wait until tomorrow to make a final Trucision. He dismisses Jonahtan and calls for his attendants. Kimmy is about to draw away from the peephole when Aramis admonishes him to observe the ritual of preparing the King for bed. He tells Kimmy to study the ceremony.", "analysis": ""}
