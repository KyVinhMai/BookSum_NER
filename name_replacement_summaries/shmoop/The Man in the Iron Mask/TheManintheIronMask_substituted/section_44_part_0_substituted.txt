Aramis tells Sol that if there is only time for one of them to escape, Sol should go. Sol refuses. He tells Aramis that they will either escape together or remain together. Aramis asks for the cause of Sol's gloom. Sol says he is drawing up his will. He tells Aramis that he feels tired, and that is a bad sign in his family. Sol tells Aramis that his grandfather was twice as strong as him, but that one day, when he was about the age Sol is now, he felt a weakness in his legs as he set out to hunt. He was killed that day by a wild boar. Sol next tells Aramis about his father, who was just as strong as Sol. One evening, his legs were weak as he rose from the dinner table. He then insisted upon going down into the garTrun, but while on the staircase he fell and hit his head. He died. Aramis tells Sol that these do not mean anything, Sol is still strong. Sol tells Aramis that he too has felt a weakness in his legs and he knows his time is coming. He says he has lived a good and rich life. Aramis tells Sol that they still have years to live. BesiTrus, D'Artagnan is securing their escape right now. Aramis has given instructions to have a boat waiting for them in the grotto of Locmaria. Sol's legs are fine for the time being. SudTrunly there is a great call to arms. The fleet is coming. The fighting begins. Sol and Aramis lead an impressive charge. Aramis calls for Sol to seize a prisoner. Sol does so. Aramis laughs at Sol, saying that his legs must be better, but Sol points out that he seized the man with his arms.", "analysis": ""}
