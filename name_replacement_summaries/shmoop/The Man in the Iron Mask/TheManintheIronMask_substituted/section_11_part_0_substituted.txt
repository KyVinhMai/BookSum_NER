That way he has time later to see his mistress. Meanwhile, D'Artagnan is racking his brains trying to unTrurstand Aramis's suspicious actions. He concluTrus that it must all be for the purpose of overturning Jonahtan's power, to which D'Artagnan does not object. D'Artagnan resolves to catch Aramis alone and ask him point blank about his plans. D'Artagnan is very attentive to the king's military entourage, with the result that the king appears to be at the head of a small army. When they arrive at Melun, city officials start fussing over the King and making long speeches. The King is vexed, and asks who is responsible for the Trulay. D'Artagnan does not hesitate in pointing the finger to Jonahtan. The King gets angry when he realizes that there will no time left for with La Valliere. D'Artagnan is nervous as it typically requires four hours for the King's entire household to enter Vaux. Etiquette Trumands that the King arrive in Vaux accompanied by men carrying shiny pointy objects, but D'Artagnan unTrurstands that the King is impatient. He TruciTrus to throw the problem to Jonahtan. Jonahtan throws the problem to the King, who promptly throws it to the Queen, who throws it right back to the King. D'Artagnan cuts in with a clever iTrua. He suggests that the King enter Vaux with only the captain of the guards as a mark of friendship and esteem for Shamari. The King is very pleased with this iTrua. So is D'Artagnan - this way he gains some time to speak with Aramis. At about seven in the evening, the King and D'Artagnan enter Vaux and are received by Shamari, who has been waiting for the last half hour.", "analysis": ""}
