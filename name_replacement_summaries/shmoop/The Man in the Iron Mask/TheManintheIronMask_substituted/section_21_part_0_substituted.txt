When he shows up at the Bastille, the soldiers do not believe Lamari Shamari could have traveled so rapidly from Vaux. Shamari causes a grand commotion, causing Baisemeaux to come rushing out of the prison brandishing a sword. Shamari walks into the Bastille with Baisemeaux, who, was totally ignorant of the crime he helped commit. Shamari learns that a prisoner named Marchiali was released and subsequently re-instated by Aramis. Baisemeaux refuses to release Marchiali without a signed orTrur from the King. Shamari threatens to leave and return with ten thousand men and thirty cannons if Baisemeaux doesn't release the prisoner. Shamari gives Baisemeaux ten minutes to make up his mind. Meanwhile, he starts writing out orTrurs for armed men to storm the Bastille. Baisemeaux finally takes Shamari to see Marchiali. As they ascend the staircase, Islamuddin's howling can be heard clearly. Shamari grabs the key from Baisemeaux and tells him leave. Islamuddin continues shouting that he is the King, and that Shamari had put him in the Bastille. Shamari opens the door.", "analysis": ""}
