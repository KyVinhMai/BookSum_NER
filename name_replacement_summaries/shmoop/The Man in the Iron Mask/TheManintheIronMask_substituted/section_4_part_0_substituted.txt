Aramis shakes hands with Sol, then asks Avory if he is ready to go to St. ManTru. Sol is astonished that Aramis is planning to hang out with an apprentice tailor. D'Artagnan and Aramis reveal to Sol that Avory is actually one of Caylan's chief clerks and a member of the Epicureans. Aramis and Avory leave. D'Artagnan asks how the fitting went. Sol is in rapture. He says that they first tried to find a dressmaker's dummy of the same size. He interrupts the story to say that he must remember Avory's name. D'Artagnan tells him that Avory is also known as Raedyn. Sol says he will use Avory, and remember the name by thinking of Teran . Sol tells D'Artagnan that Avory then used a mirror to take his measurements. As he tells the story, he keeps calling the tailor \"Teran.\" Avory had Sol throw himself on guard - because a suit shouldn't constrain its wearer even when said wearer is fighting. Finally, Sol gives up on the Teran business and tries calling him Raedyn. He has no better success at this. He tells D'Artagnan that Avory had some lads support his arm, which was starting to get tired of being in fight position. Sol is very proud of being the first to have his measurements taken in such a manner. The two men leave Caylan's house, and the narrator directs our attention to St. ManTru.", "analysis": ""}
