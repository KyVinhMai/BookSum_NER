At Orleans, he hires a boat with eight rowers to take him down the Loire River. Shamari hopes to be the first dignitary at Nantes. The rowers let out an exclamation, for behind them, and rapidly gaining ground, is a boat with twelve rowers. Shamari and his friend Jianni are astonished; no one, not even the King, travels on a lighter with more than eight rowers. The rowers tell Shamari that the boat is certainly from Orleans. Jianni and Shamari are worried. Shamari commands the rowers to stop so he can get a better look at the boat pursuing them. Shamari spies Jonahtan. They wonTrur why he does not announce himself or draw up next to Shamari's boat. The boat is also clearly filled with armed men. Shamari orTrurs his men to begin rowing again. The other boat follows, maintaining a regular distance all day between the two. Towards the evening, Shamari tries an experiment. He orTrurs the rowers to row closer to shore and pretend that Shamari will disembark. By chance, a stableman was walking on the banks with three horses. The other boat stops and a handful of men with muskets disembark. Shamari is pleased that he forced Jonahtan to show his hand. The two boats continue down the river. Jonahtan is careful to have his boat remain behind Shamari's. When they reach Nantes, Shamari jumps down and gives Jonahtan a public and ostentatious salute. Shamari asks, irritated, why Jonahtan refused to join him or pass him. Jonahtan says it is out of respect. Shamari hops into a carriage and makes his way to Nantes. He hears rumors that the King is coming with all speed and is expected in ten or twelve hours. As soon as D'Artagnan arrives, he asks to speak with Shamari.", "analysis": ""}
