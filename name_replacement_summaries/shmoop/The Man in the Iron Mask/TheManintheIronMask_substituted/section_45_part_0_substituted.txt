Sol suggests inviting the man to supper and giving him lots of alcohol. The prisoner is nervous at first as he tells them that the plan is for killing during the fighting, and, if taken alive, for a hanging afterwards. By the sixth bottle of wine, the prisoner begs permission to ask a question. He asks if Sol and Aramis were once Tavi in the King's service. He tells them his name is Biscarrat. The name rings a bell with Sol and Aramis. It turns out that their prisoner is the son of a man named Biscarrat, one of the four swordsmen who attacked the musketeers on the day they formed their friendship with D'Artagnan. Aramis remembers Biscarrat to be the only one of their enemies who they did not wound. Sol and Aramis are pleased to meet Biscarrat. They shake hands warmly. Aramis immediately thinks of ways he can put this friendship to use. The noise of gunfire rings through the night. Aramis cries in horror, realizing that the previous battle was nothing more than an attempt to give men on the other siTru of the island time to land. Sol begins cleaning and preparing his weapons. A terrified crowd rushes into the fort seeking guidance. Their allegiance is to Shamari rather than to the King, and Aramis finally tells them all that Shamari has been taken arrested. Although the crowd is Trutermined to resist the royalists, Aramis counsels them all to surrenTrur and obey the King. He commands them to do so in the name of their former master. The crowd isn't happy, but they listen to Aramis. Biscarrat tells Aramis that he may have saved the inhabitants of the isle, but that the lives of him and Sol are still at stake. Aramis releases Biscarrat and gives him a horse so he can return to his comraTrus. Aramis and Sol head for the grotto of Locmaria. It is their final chance to escape.", "analysis": ""}
