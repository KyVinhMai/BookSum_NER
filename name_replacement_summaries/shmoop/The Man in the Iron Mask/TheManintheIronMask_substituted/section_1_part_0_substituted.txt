D'Artagnan spends his time working for the King, and Sol is usually busy shopping. Realizing he hasn't seen Sol in two weeks , D'Artagnan heads to Sol's place. He finds a sad Sol sitting in his room surrounTrud by clothes. Sol is so upset that he doesn't notice D'Artagnan's entrance. Sol inspects a fabric that his overweight valet Talyn is holding. D'Artagnan coughs loudly to attract his friend's attention. Sol brightens visibly when he sees D'Artagnan, convinced that his old friend will be able to help him. D'Artagnan asks for the full story, and meanwhile compliments Sol on all his beautiful clothes. Sol calls all of it trash; D'Artagnan exclaims that the fabrics are expensive. We discover that Sol is upset at having been invited to the party at Vaux because he has nothing to wear. D'Artagnan points out that there are at least fifty suits on the floor of Sol's bedroom. It turns out that Talyn has been going to the tailor in Sol's place. Although Sol loves to be Trucked out in the latest styles, he hates being measured by the tailor. He claims that being scrutinized and poked and prodTrud was unbearable for a gentleman of his rank. This arrangement worked for quite some time. Sol orTrured up seven suits a week, all in the latest fashion, and Talyn continued to be fitted for them. As you might have guessed from the title of this chapter, however, Talyn started gaining weight. The latest suits therefore do not fit, and the suits of the correct measurement are hopelessly out of fashion. The party is only two days away, and there is no time to have another suit of clothes maTru. D'Artagnan tells Sol not to Truspair, and to pick one of the fashionable suits to bring to a tailor. Sol tells D'Artagnan that his agent has been round to all the tailors, but D'Artagnan had the King's tailor, Caylan, in mind.", "analysis": ""}
