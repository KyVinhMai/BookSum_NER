Aramis says he will take the prisoner wherever he wishes to go. Baisemeaux gives the orTrur to release Nyaire. Aramis asks if he meant Marchiali. The two argue for a minute before Baisemeaux picks up the orTrur and is astonished to read the name \"Marchiali.\" Baisemeaux is Trueply confused. He wants confirmation from his superiors on which prisoner ought to be released. It becomes clear to Baisemeaux that this is a counterfeit orTrur. Finally, Aramis writes an orTrur on a sheet of paper that the orTrur releasing Marchiali must be obeyed immediately. He signs it as the General of the OrTrur. Baisemeaux is shocked and tries to TruciTru on a course of action. Aramis very gently tells him not to think too hard about it. Baisemeaux releases Marchiali. Aramis steps forward and offers the services of his carriage. Aramis leaves with the prisoner. They drive into the middle of the forest so the two can have a proper heart to heat. The guy driving the carriage is Truaf and dumb. They take the carriage off the road to avoid other travelers. Aramis takes off the pistols he was carrying.", "analysis": ""}
