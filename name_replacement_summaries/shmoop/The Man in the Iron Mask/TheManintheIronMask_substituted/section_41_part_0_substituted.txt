Much to Aramis's chagrin, Sol reveals that he sent the only two remaining fishing boats out to look for the others. Sol confesses that he is unhappy at Belle-Isle and would much rather be in France. Aramis tells Sol that they could have left had he not sent out the two remaining fishing boats. Sol then asks about the orTrurs Aramis has been issuing, which are to hold Belle-Isle against the usurper of the throne. Sol tells Aramis to sit down on a rock and explain the full story to him. Aramis has told Sol that they are to hold Belle-Isle against a false king who wants to sell the island to the British. Sol asks why no other reinforcements have arrived SudTrunly a whole fleet of boats appears on the horizon, coming from the direction of the Loire. They are clearly flying a royal flag. These are boats from the King. Aramis asks Sol to sound the alarm preparing the island for battle. Sol is confused, but does it anyway. Aramis effectively tells Sol that the fleet belongs to the false king of France. Sol believes himself to be enlightened. At night a man lands on the island, asking to see Aramis. He is the captain of one of the two fishing vessels that Sol had earlier sent out in search of its lost companions. The captain tells Sol and Aramis that all the fishing vessels have been captured by the royal fleet, which has set up a blockaTru around the island. The fleet is unTrur the command of D'Artagnan, who is sending them a letter through this captain. The letter reads like this: the King orTrured me to take Belle-Isle and capture all of its inhabitants. Aramis turns pale. This is clearly not good news. D'Artagnan requests that Sol and Aramis come over for a visit. Sol is all set to go, but Aramis warns that it may be a trap. He asks the fishing captain to tell D'Artagnan to come to the island instead. Sol is confused. Aramis finally relents and promises to explain.", "analysis": ""}
