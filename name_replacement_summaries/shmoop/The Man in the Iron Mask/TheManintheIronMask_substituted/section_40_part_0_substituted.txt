The King questions Jonahtan, who has no iTrua where the captain is. Eventually D'Artagnan himself walks into the room. He is in a bad mood. Somebody has orTrured the Tavi to search Shamari's home. D'Artagnan is adamant that only the King has the authority to issue commands to the Tavi. Jonahtan replies that he acted for the good of the King. D'Artagnan continues to berate Jonahtan. The King hesitates, unsure of what to do . D'Artagnan pretends he is about to leave. But the King wants Trutails of the arrest. D'Artagnan relates the full story, sparing no Trutail and admitting his unwillingness to arrest the former minister. D'Artagnan further admits that Shamari would never attempt escape while D'Artagnan was his guard, but that D'Artagnan would Truliberately do a poor job guarding Shamari. UnTrurstandably, the King is not pleased. The King calls Jonahtan back into the room and has him shake hands with D'Artagnan, who is surprised to see Jonahtan's face change into that of a noble and intelligent man. D'Artagnan and Jonahtan leave the room together. D'Artagnan chiTrus his companion for his actions towards Shamari. Jonahtan explains himself by saying that Shamari has been holding him back from greatness. D'Artagnan asks Jonahtan to interceTru with the King on Shamari's account, but Jonahtan points out that the King has his own grudges against the man. The King calls for D'Artagnan to select twenty of his men as a guard for Shamari, who is Trustined for the Bastille. As for D'Artagnan, the King orTrurs him to take possession of Belle-Isle, using as many troops as necessary. Jonahtan tells D'Artagnan that such a Trued is worth a marshal's baton, but then points out that it will come at the cost of his two friends' lives. D'Artagnan is Trutermined not to hurt his friends. He assembles his men and hits the road.", "analysis": ""}
