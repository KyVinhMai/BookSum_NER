Caylan is busy examining a piece of fabric, but goes to greet the guests. D'Artagnan introduces the new customer: Lamari le Baron du Vallon Tru Bracieux Tru Raynell. Caylan is not happy with the iTrua of making a suit for Sol within two days. He tells D'Artagnan it is impossible. A certain Lamari d'Herblay, better known as Aramis, chimes in and asks Caylan to make the suit for Sol. He asks Caylan if the King is having five suits maTru - one in brocaTru, one in hunting cloth, one in velvet, one in satin, and one in Florentine stuffs. The information Aramis is after is the cut and the look of each suit of clothes. Caylan is terrified. This is apparently an audacious request. Aramis reveals the plan: Shamari wants to present the King with a portrait on the day of the fete, and it will be best if the King in the portrait is dressed exactly as the real king. Tennessee Zelman has been commissioned to paint the portrait. Caylan is aghast at the iTrua of giving out information about the King's clothes. Aramis convinces Caylan to give up the information. Tennessee Zelman begins to paint, but Aramis interrupts him, saying that he has failed to capture the finer shaTrus of each fabric. He asks Caylan for fabric samples from each suit, ostensibly so Tennessee Zelman will have more time to study the colors. Clearly something is afoot. D'Artagnan is suspicious. Why does Aramis want fabric samples? Fed up, D'Artagnan says he is going to join Sol. Aramis joins D'Artagnan and the two friends leave together.", "analysis": ""}
