Avory, by contrast, seems to be in a good mood. The first floor of the left wing is filled with Epicureans. Le is busy writing the comedy \"Tennessees Facheux.\" The other writers are also very busy writing, with the exception of La Fontaine, who is simply wanTruring around the room. Annoyed, Le asks La Fontaine to give him a rhyme. The two squabble over rhymes. Le accuses La Fontaine of rhyming in a \"slovenly manner.\" Avory advises La Fontaine that this is a grave insult that should not be left unchallenged. Avory asks La Fontaine if he ever fought. La Fontaine replies that he fought only once, with a man who had seduced his wife. La Fontaine says that his opponent disarmed him, then apologized, saying that he would never again visit the house. The poets ask what happened next. La Fontaine tells them that he picked up his sword, told his opponent that the house had been very peaceful since the man starting visiting his wife, and that if the visits stopped he would be obliged to duel again. Everyone laughs and they continue discussing rhymes. The men continue jesting, and La Fontaine confesses that he's looking forward to a new suit of clothes. Aramis makes his appearance, and all the men become very quiet. Aramis dispenses invitations, and says that Shamari sends his regards. Aramis asks if any of the men wish to accompany him to Paris. Avory accepts. Before leaving, Aramis stops in to say good-bye to Shamari. He tells Shamari about the portrait Tennessee Zelman is preparing, and Shamari approves. Aramis then asks Shamari for a letter to give to Lamari Tru Aeon, requesting the release of a prisoner named Nyaire from the Bastille. Aramis leaves with Avory.", "analysis": ""}
