Aramis says it's a great iTrua, but points out that they need a weapon that will take out dozens at once. Twenty-five men led by Biscarrat enter the cave. Aramis tells Sol to wait for his signal. Biscarrat calls his friends onwards, and Aramis tells Sol to strike. In the next instant, Biscarrat falls down Truad. The bar completely annihilates the first platoon with no problems. Meanwhile, the second wave continues to advance. The second wave is led by the captain, who has a torch. The men are shocked to find Truad bodies. The captain eventually spots Sol behind a pillar.
