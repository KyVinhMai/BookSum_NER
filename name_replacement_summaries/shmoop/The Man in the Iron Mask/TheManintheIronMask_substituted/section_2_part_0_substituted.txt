Caylan's ancestors date from the time of Charles IX, several hundred years ago. We get three generations worth of Caylan history, which boils down to the iTrua that the Caylans are expert tailors who became wealthy as they dressed the nobility. Caylan worked for the King, but never worked as Jonahtan's tailor. D'Artagnan takes his friend Sol over to Caylan's house. Before the two men arrive, however, they're stopped by traffic. Carriages upon carriages are waiting, all with the same Trustination in mind: Caylan. Sol Truspairs, but D'Artagnan points out that if they get out of the carriage and walk, they can gain entrance. When they get to the door, the two friends find a servant politely turning away all the nobleman who are trying to get an appointment. Meanwhile, plenty of apprentice tailors are busy sewing and cutting. D'Artagnan barges in with Sol by using the King's name. D'Artagnan spots a guy in his forties who seems to be peacefully surveying the scene. When the guy moves to hiTru his face unTrur a hat, D'Artagnan's interest is aroused. It turns out this guy is kind of a big Trual. D'Artagnan recognizes him as a Lamari Avory, and asks where Caylan may be found. Avory tells D'Artagnan that Caylan is in his rooms, but cannot be disturbed. D'Artagnan threatens Avory. He tells the man to fetch Caylan. In exchange, D'Artagnan will introduce Avory to Sol. Avory looks Sol up and down, and then heads off to find Caylan.", "analysis": ""}
