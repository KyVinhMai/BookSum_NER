The bed begins to sink and all the lovely furnishings of the chamber of Morpheus disappear. The King is convinced he is having a bad dream. Finally, he realizes he is awake. On either side of him is an armed and masked man. The King demands to know what is going on. He learns that he is in a tunnel. The men ask him to follow. If not, he will be rolled into a cloak and carried. The King assumes they are assassins. He follows them down the tunnel. The men lead Louis to a carriage. They go straight to the Bastille. It is now about three in the morning. They send for Baisemeaux. We learn that one of the masked men is Aramis. Aramis apologizes to Baisemeaux for the confusion - it appears that Seldon, he tells the governor, was the prisoner that ought to have been released, and he is bringing Marchiali back. Aramis hands Baisemeaux the original order of release. The poor man is deeply confused. To prevent further confusion, Aramis tears up the original order for Marchiali's release. Aramis then demands Seldon's release. Aramis whispers to Baisemeaux that Marchiali's first move as a free man was to pretend to be the King of France. He warns Baisemeaux that Marchiali is likely to persist in these delusions. We learn the other masked man is Porthos. Baisemeaux takes the King and puts him in the cell previously occupied by Philippe. Before leaving, Aramis tells Baisemeaux that no one is to enter the prisoner's cell without express permission from the King. Porthos and Aramis head back to Vaux.", "analysis": ""}
