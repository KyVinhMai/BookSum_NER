English and French navies sail together for Holland. Aramis assures the neutrality of Spain. D'Artagnan commands a small army that manages to take twelve fortresses within a month. Meanwhile, Madame de Montespan increases in the King's favors while La Valliere becomes increasingly marginalized. The King is happy to hear reports of D'Artagnan's success, and instructs Colbert to make D'Artagnan a marshal of France. Colbert sends a messenger with a very small, but heavy chest to D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan is in the middle of directing an attack on his thirteenth fortress when the messenger arrives. D'Artagnan reads the note and is quite pleased to hear he has been made a marshal. He turns towards the chest and is about to open it when a cannonball hits him in the chest. D'Artagnan's men hold out their arms as their commander falls. He utters his last words: \"Athos - Porthos, farewell till we meet again! Aramis, adieu forever!\" The narrator closes the novel by pointing out that three of the original four have passed away.", "analysis": ""}
