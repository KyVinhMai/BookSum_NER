Porthos brags that he will soon be a duke. Aramis asks to speak to Athos in private, then tells him the whole story. Aramis is convinced that he can salvage the situation through his allies in Spain. He invites Athos to join them. Athos refuses. He asks Aramis to promise to look after Porthos, and loans his two best horses to his friends. As Aramis and Porthos saddle up for their departure, Athos is overcome with grief and hugs his two friends good-bye. He tells Raoul he believes it will be the last time he will see his friends. Raoul replies that he had the same thought. The two men are sad. Athos's friend the Duke de Beaufort shows up for a welcome visit.", "analysis": ""}
