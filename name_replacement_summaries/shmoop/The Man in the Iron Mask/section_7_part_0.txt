Aramis says he will take the prisoner wherever he wishes to go. Baisemeaux gives the order to release Seldon. Aramis asks if he meant Marchiali. The two argue for a minute before Baisemeaux picks up the order and is astonished to read the name \"Marchiali.\" Baisemeaux is deeply confused. He wants confirmation from his superiors on which prisoner ought to be released. It becomes clear to Baisemeaux that this is a counterfeit order. Finally, Aramis writes an order on a sheet of paper that the order releasing Marchiali must be obeyed immediately. He signs it as the General of the Order. Baisemeaux is shocked and tries to decide on a course of action. Aramis very gently tells him not to think too hard about it. Baisemeaux releases Marchiali. Aramis steps forward and offers the services of his carriage. Aramis leaves with the prisoner. They drive into the middle of the forest so the two can have a proper heart to heat. The guy driving the carriage is deaf and dumb. They take the carriage off the road to avoid other travelers. Aramis takes off the pistols he was carrying.", "analysis": ""}
