M. de Gesvres tells him that the King does not want to be disturbed. Used to having free access to the King and his quarters, D'Artagnan is angry . Worried about his friends, he decides to seek out Colbert. He learns that Colbert is with the King. Really angry now, he returns to the hallway outside the King's room. M. de Lyonne comes out, and D'Artagnan tells him to tell the King that he is resigning. Lyonne relays the message. The King seems fine with it. D'Artagnan is relieved to be a plain citizen again, and wants to head straight back to Belle-Isle. At eight o'clock D'Artagnan is in the hostelry saddling his horse when Gesvres shows up with twelve horsemen. D'Artagnan asks if he is being arrested. Gesvres tells him that the King wants to speak with him. D'Artagnan is annoyed and doesn't care what the King wants or feels, but he walks with Gesvres anyway. As D'Artagnan waits for the King to conclude his business with Colbert, the guards standing behind him make it look as though he has been arrested. Word begins to circulate and all the Musketeers begin to make a ruckus. D'Artagnan is disappointed in the quality of today's Musketeers.", "analysis": ""}
