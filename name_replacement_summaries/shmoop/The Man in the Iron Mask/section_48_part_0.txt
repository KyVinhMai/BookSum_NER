They cannot escape while the attack occurs Porthos suggests that he hide behind a pillar with a iron bar that he can use to bash in their heads. Aramis says it's a great idea, but points out that they need a weapon that will take out dozens at once. Twenty-five men led by Biscarrat enter the cave. Aramis tells Porthos to wait for his signal. Biscarrat calls his friends onwards, and Aramis tells Porthos to strike. In the next instant, Biscarrat falls down dead. The bar completely annihilates the first platoon with no problems. Meanwhile, the second wave continues to advance. The second wave is led by the captain, who has a torch. The men are shocked to find dead bodies. The captain eventually spots Porthos behind a pillar. Porthos strangles the captain to death and extinguishes the light, sending the rest of the men into terror. They begin shooting blindly. They are met only with silence and the sounds of the third group entering the cavern.", "analysis": ""}
