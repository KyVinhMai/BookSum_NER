Percerin's ancestors date from the time of Charles IX, several hundred years ago. We get three generations worth of Percerin history, which boils down to the idea that the Percerins are expert tailors who became wealthy as they dressed the nobility. Percerin worked for the King, but never worked as Colbert's tailor. D'Artagnan takes his friend Porthos over to Percerin's house. Before the two men arrive, however, they're stopped by traffic. Carriages upon carriages are waiting, all with the same destination in mind: Percerin. Porthos despairs, but D'Artagnan points out that if they get out of the carriage and walk, they can gain entrance. When they get to the door, the two friends find a servant politely turning away all the nobleman who are trying to get an appointment. Meanwhile, plenty of apprentice tailors are busy sewing and cutting. D'Artagnan barges in with Porthos by using the King's name. D'Artagnan spots a guy in his forties who seems to be peacefully surveying the scene. When the guy moves to hide his face under a hat, D'Artagnan's interest is aroused. It turns out this guy is kind of a big deal. D'Artagnan recognizes him as a Monsieur Moliere, and asks where Percerin may be found. Moliere tells D'Artagnan that Percerin is in his rooms, but cannot be disturbed. D'Artagnan threatens Moliere. He tells the man to fetch Percerin. In exchange, D'Artagnan will introduce Moliere to Porthos. Moliere looks Porthos up and down, and then heads off to find Percerin.", "analysis": ""}
