As soon as he is ready to go, however, he loses all his strength and is obliged to rest. Every time he tries to leave, he is overtaken by fatigue. Clearly, he is not supposed to leave the house. Athos takes a nap. Mail is delivered today, but there is nothing for Athos. He is upset, for this means he must wait another eight days. Athos catches a fever. The physician comes to tend to him. Athos dreams he is in Africa witnessing battle. Night falls and Athos can see fallen bodies under a \"mild and pale moon.\" Athos is horrified as he looks at the corpses. He sees Beaufort's white horse lying on the ground. Worried, Athos looks for his son. Finally exhausted, Athos rests for a moment under a tent. From far away he can see a white figure approaching. The figure is dressed as an officer. Athos recognizes Raoul and cries out to him. Raoul beckons his father to follow him, then glides away. Athos follows Raoul to the top of a hill. Raoul begins to ascend straight up into the air and beckons his father to follow.", "analysis": ""}
