He is full of grief. The narrator delivers a touching obituary. The men row towards Spain as Aramis sinks into a silent, immovable grief. The men soon realize they are being chased, but do not disturb their master until an hour has past. Aramis does not reply. The ship continues pursuit. There are twenty-five men on the ship, and they soon fire a cannon at the little boat. The sailors are afraid. Aramis tells the men to wait for the ship. The little boat surrenders. The terms of the surrender are that the servants' lives will be spared, but not Aramis's. Aramis tells his men to accept the conditions. Once on board, Aramis makes a sign to the captain and shows him the setting of one of his rings. The captain begins obeying Aramis. Aramis spends the night leaning on the rails, and one of his men later notices that the wood upon which Aramis's head rested was soaked with moisture. The narrator speculates that that moisture was the first tears Aramis ever shed. The narrator says that is equal to any epitaph Porthos could have received.", "analysis": ""}
