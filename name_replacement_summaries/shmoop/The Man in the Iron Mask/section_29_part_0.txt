Their only remaining errand is to visit M. de Beaufort's palatial residence and sort out all the details for departure. Like Planchet, M. de Beaufort, , is making an inventory of all his belongings. It turns out that he owes almost two million, so he is trying to sell off and give away all of his belongings, and then borrow even more money so he can finance the expedition to Africa. M. de Beaufort welcomes his two visitors, and hands Raoul his commission. Raoul will leave before M. de Beaufort as far as Antibes. Raoul will need to prepare the army for deployment in two weeks) M. de Beaufort gives Raoul an order allowing him to search all the isles along the coast recruiting soldiers.
