When he shows up at the Bastille, the soldiers do not believe Monsieur Fouquet could have traveled so rapidly from Vaux. Fouquet causes a grand commotion, causing Baisemeaux to come rushing out of the prison brandishing a sword. Fouquet walks into the Bastille with Baisemeaux, who, was totally ignorant of the crime he helped commit. Fouquet learns that a prisoner named Marchiali was released and subsequently re-instated by Aramis. Baisemeaux refuses to release Marchiali without a signed order from the King. Fouquet threatens to leave and return with ten thousand men and thirty cannons if Baisemeaux doesn't release the prisoner. Fouquet gives Baisemeaux ten minutes to make up his mind. Meanwhile, he starts writing out orders for armed men to storm the Bastille. Baisemeaux finally takes Fouquet to see Marchiali. As they ascend the staircase, Louis's howling can be heard clearly. Fouquet grabs the key from Baisemeaux and tells him leave. Louis continues shouting that he is the King, and that Fouquet had put him in the Bastille. Fouquet opens the door.", "analysis": ""}
