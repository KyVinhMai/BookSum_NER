He hears a sound, looks around the room, and sees an enormous rat. He gives an involuntary shout, and then fully realizes he is not dreaming, but actually a prisoner in the Bastille. He is convinced Fouquet is behind all of this. The King begins shouting for the governor of the Bastille at the top of his lungs, and in general makes a loud ruckus. The other prisoners start getting angry. They need their sleep after all. Finally a jailer yells at him to be quiet. Louis continues making noise any way he can. He begins to despair, then wonders when the first meal is served. He feels guilty that he cannot remember this small detail about his own prison. A jailer comes in with food and notes that Louis must have been going quite mad to break all his furniture. Louis demands to see the governor and threatens the jailer.
