While D'Artagnan is talking with the King, Fouquet reads the letter. In Gourville's handwriting, the letter informs Fouquet that a white horse is ready to bear him to safety. The Fouquet destroys the note. Fouquet goes in to see the King. The King asks after his health. Fouquet makes one last attempt to clear his name and defend himself. A little while into their conversation, it is clear Fouquet needs to go to bed. The King summons D'Artagnan to escort the man. Fouquet refuses, saying that a simple footman would do. Once Fouquet leaves, the King orders that D'Artagnan follow him. He asks D'Artagnan to arrest Fouquet, then orders a bunch of draconian measures like a special carriage to prevent notes being thrown out the window. D'Artagnan admits to the King that he tried to save Fouquet, but says that now he will execute his orders. D'Artagnan leaves the King. As he leaves, he sees a very cheerful Gourville heading to Fouquet's lodgings.", "analysis": ""}
