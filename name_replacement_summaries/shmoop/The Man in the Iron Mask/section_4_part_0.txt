Aramis shakes hands with Porthos, then asks Moliere if he is ready to go to St. Mande. Porthos is astonished that Aramis is planning to hang out with an apprentice tailor. D'Artagnan and Aramis reveal to Porthos that Moliere is actually one of Percerin's chief clerks and a member of the Epicureans. Aramis and Moliere leave. D'Artagnan asks how the fitting went. Porthos is in rapture. He says that they first tried to find a dressmaker's dummy of the same size. He interrupts the story to say that he must remember Moliere's name. D'Artagnan tells him that Moliere is also known as Poquelin. Porthos says he will use Moliere, and remember the name by thinking of Voliere . Porthos tells D'Artagnan that Moliere then used a mirror to take his measurements. As he tells the story, he keeps calling the tailor \"Voliere.\" Moliere had Porthos throw himself on guard - because a suit shouldn't constrain its wearer even when said wearer is fighting. Finally, Porthos gives up on the Voliere business and tries calling him Poquelin. He has no better success at this. He tells D'Artagnan that Moliere had some lads support his arm, which was starting to get tired of being in fight position. Porthos is very proud of being the first to have his measurements taken in such a manner. The two men leave Percerin's house, and the narrator directs our attention to St. Mande.", "analysis": ""}
