They expect to find three servants there to help them. Porthos's legs go weak again at the entrance to the grotto. Aramis enters the grotto and gives a pre-arranged signal. Porthos descends as Aramis examines the canoe, which is well-stocked with firepower. The servants begin placing rollers under the boat in preparation of the move, but before they are finished a pack of dogs enters the grotto. A fox seeks refuge in the grotto, but it is followed by a pack of hounds, and behind the hounds, men. The King's guards, led by Biscarrat, are on a hunt. Aramis orders the dogs killed so their masters are not tempted to follow and discover the boat. The six dogs are killed, but there are still the sixteen masters left. Aramis and Porthos conceal themselves in preparation for shooting the men. The servants will load the muskets for them. Porthos asks how they are to treat Biscarrat. Aramis replies that they ought to shoot him first, since he can recognize the two rebels.", "analysis": ""}
