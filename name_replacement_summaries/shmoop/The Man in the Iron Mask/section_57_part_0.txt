A man on horseback has arrived and is now ascending the stairs. It is Grimaud. Athos asks if Raoul is dead. Grimaud answers in the affirmative. Athos raises his eyes to heaven, imagining that he is once again on the hill, watching his son ascend into heaven. He says, \"Here I am,\" then dies. Athos looks so peaceful that the servants think he is sleeping. Grimaud knows better. He can tell his master is dead. D'Artagnan walks in, calling for Athos. Grimaud points to the bed. It is clear Athos is dead. Grimaud kisses the foot of the bed and begins to cry. D'Artagnan kisses his friend Athos on the forehead. He begins to wail with grief. The servants join in. Only Grimaud remains silent as Athos taught him. The next day, D'Artagnan asks Grimaud for information on Raoul's death.", "analysis": ""}
