Fouquet wanders throughout his property making sure everything is perfect for the King's arrival. Aramis waves him over to where Le Brun is putting the finishing touches on a portrait of the King. It is perfect. Even Percerin admits as much. Fouquet is so happy that he kisses Le Brun. Fouquet receives word that the King's procession has been seen approaching. He confesses to Aramis that, if the King were willing, they could actually be friends. Aramis tells Fouquet to tell Colbert that, and maybe the man will take pity on him. Aramis leaves to change clothes. We learn that he is staying in the room directly above the King's. Porthos is staying next door.", "analysis": ""}
