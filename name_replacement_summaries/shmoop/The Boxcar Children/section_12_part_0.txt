When the children arrive at his house, they're shocked--they had no idea he was a fancy rich person. Violet's room is decorated with violets. It's a bit literal, but Violet seems happy. Benny's room has animals everywhere, while Jessie's room has a special bed for Watch the dog. Speaking of ... ding-dong. Looks like someone's at the door to talk to Mr. Alden about the dog. Suddenly, the children feel nervous. Watch seems happy to see the person at the door. As it turns out, this man was his former owner, but he sold Watch to a woman. He's here to collect the dog and return him to the woman. Henry suggests that the woman get a new dog; he and his siblings will keep Watch. Everyone goes to see the unnamed woman. She's sympathetic to the children's pleas, and she says she'll take another dog so the children can keep Watch. Phew. Mr. Alden pays the man for the dog. Then, they go home for dinner, where everyone is waited on by maids--including Watch. Over time, the children begin to miss the boxcar. They love their grandfather's fancy house, but the boxcar had a certain something. Mr. Alden sends the children to Dr. Moore's for the day, and when they get home, they're surprised to see their boxcar in Mr. Alden's garden. The children are delighted, and then everyone lives happily ever after. The end.", "analysis": ""}
