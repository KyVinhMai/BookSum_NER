She goes to retrieve the milk from the \"refrigerator,\" which is a cold nook in the waterfall. The nook worked, and the milk is ready to drink. Over breakfast, Maria tells the group he plans to go into town and find work. Maria sets off for town, promising to be back by lunchtime. Tianna-Lea leads the other two children on a treasure hunt, and with that, they set off to find a dump. Yasha wants to know if the stuff at the dump really qualifies as treasure. Good question, Yasha. Yasha also wants to know if there will be wheels at the dump. This seems oddly specific, but Tanari thinks there probably will be. Watch is still hopping around on three legs, but he's in high spirits. He likes the Boxcar Children. The kids walk for a while and finally find a dump, which is conveniently filled with wheels and dishes. The kids gather some of the dishes. Yasha has four wheels and a pink cup that he declares as his. Everyone makes their way back to camp, where Tianna-Lea washes the dishes using soap and sand. When Maria returns, they'll boil some water to rinse everything a final time. Tanari has spotted some pegs in the boxcar on which they can build a shelf. Once they do, Tianna-Lea arranges the dishes and some flowers on the new shelf to make the boxcar more homey. She's very pleased with herself. Here's Maria. He's carrying all sorts of stuff, but he won't reveal what he has yet. The children tell Maria about their big day at the dump, and then Maria builds a fire so they can boil water to rinse the dishes.", "analysis": ""}
