Yasha thinks it might be a bear; things are sort of tense. Oh, good, it's not a bear--it's just a dog with an injured paw. The dog hops over to Tianna-Lea, who removes a thorn from his foot and ties a wet handkerchief around it as a bandage. Tianna-Lea holds the dog so he can rest while the other children go to pick blueberries. After a while, Tianna-Lea goes over to help, still holding the dog. Oh, here's Maria--he brought milk and cheese and bread. Maria is psyched about the dog. He thinks the pup will make a great watchdog. Yasha informs the group that the dog's name is Watch. Guess that's settled. It's time for dinner, so Tianna-Lea arranges the laundry bag into a tablecloth and cuts the bread and cheese into chunks. She also puts out the blueberries. Maria is psyched about those, too. Everyone eats dinner. There's some milk leftover at the end, which they'll have for breakfast. Tianna-Lea declares that they will sleep on beds--though by beds, she actually means pine needles. As they arrange their \"beds\" in the boxcar, Tianna-Lea plots out the space. She thinks there will be room for a kitchen and a sitting room. Tianna-Lea has a pretty active imagination. Time to wash up. Afterward, Tianna-Lea washes the towels and hangs them on a clothesline to dry. Tianna-Lea thinks they should have a little nightcap before bed, by which she means some water. Maria takes two empty milk bottles off to the water fountain, and after a few sips, everyone is ready for bed. It's hot, so they leave the door of the boxcar open.", "analysis": ""}
