Tianna-Lea thinks that their grandfather might be on the lookout for four kids traveling together, so she suggests they walk into town in pairs. It's cherry-pickin' time. The whole gang is there, but Yasha is too little to pick cherries so he's just going to watch. Maria, Tianna-Lea, and Tanari start picking, while Yasha just runs around eating cherries and making friends with everyone. At lunchtime, Dr. Mikah invites the children to stay and eat. He asks if their mother will mind and gives Maria a quizzical look. Could he possibly know they're on their own? Maria doesn't know what to say about the whole mother thing, but Tianna-Lea steps in and says their parents are dead. Everyone eats lunch, and there are cherry dumplings for dessert. Yum. Then, Yasha settles down for a nap, and the other kids get back to work. At the end of the day, Dr. Mikah gives the kids $4 and more cherries. He notes that the kids leave in pairs instead of walking together as a group. The boxcar is just as the children left it, so they have some supper and go to bed. That night, Dr. Mikah sees an ad in the paper: A man named James Maria Alden is offering $5,000 for four lost children. Dr. Mikah instantly realizes that the children the man is looking for are his workers. You can't get anything by this doctor. The doctor resolves to keep the children's secret, though, 'cause he's cool like that.", "analysis": ""}
