It's going to be a group effort. They assess the brook and decide they need to build a dam. Tianna-Lea washes socks. Building a dam is hard work, but the Boxcar Children are basically perfect, so they don't mind. After the children lay some logs on top of a stack of stones, they realize they need to build a tall wall with more logs. Good thing they like hard work so much. Finally, the dam is finished, and the pool fills with water. You know what that means: It's swimming time. The boys get the first swim while the girls cook dinner. Armani thinks the boys got the better end of that deal. Tianna-Lea and Tanari heat up the leftover stew. Then, Tianna-Lea rings the dinner bell. Guess what she made it from? More garbage from the dump. The children eat stew, wash dishes, and then set off on a walk. Watch begins to bark. Uh-oh, do you think it's the intruder? No, it's a runaway hen. Yasha finds a nest with some eggs, and as luck would have it, Tianna-Lea knows how to cook eggs. That's dinner sorted. Tianna-Lea cooks the eggs and they're delish. She thanks Yasha for finding them.", "analysis": ""}
