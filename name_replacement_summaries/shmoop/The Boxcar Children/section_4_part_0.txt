She goes to retrieve the milk from the \"refrigerator,\" which is a cold nook in the waterfall. The nook worked, and the milk is ready to drink. Over breakfast, Henry tells the group he plans to go into town and find work. Henry sets off for town, promising to be back by lunchtime. Jessie leads the other two children on a treasure hunt, and with that, they set off to find a dump. Benny wants to know if the stuff at the dump really qualifies as treasure. Good question, Benny. Benny also wants to know if there will be wheels at the dump. This seems oddly specific, but Violet thinks there probably will be. Watch is still hopping around on three legs, but he's in high spirits. He likes the Boxcar Children. The kids walk for a while and finally find a dump, which is conveniently filled with wheels and dishes. The kids gather some of the dishes. Benny has four wheels and a pink cup that he declares as his. Everyone makes their way back to camp, where Jessie washes the dishes using soap and sand. When Henry returns, they'll boil some water to rinse everything a final time. Violet has spotted some pegs in the boxcar on which they can build a shelf. Once they do, Jessie arranges the dishes and some flowers on the new shelf to make the boxcar more homey. She's very pleased with herself. Here's Henry. He's carrying all sorts of stuff, but he won't reveal what he has yet. The children tell Henry about their big day at the dump, and then Henry builds a fire so they can boil water to rinse the dishes.", "analysis": ""}
