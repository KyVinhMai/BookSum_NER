It's going to be a group effort. They assess the brook and decide they need to build a dam. Jessie washes socks. Building a dam is hard work, but the Boxcar Children are basically perfect, so they don't mind. After the children lay some logs on top of a stack of stones, they realize they need to build a tall wall with more logs. Good thing they like hard work so much. Finally, the dam is finished, and the pool fills with water. You know what that means: It's swimming time. The boys get the first swim while the girls cook dinner. Shmoop thinks the boys got the better end of that deal. Jessie and Violet heat up the leftover stew. Then, Jessie rings the dinner bell. Guess what she made it from? More garbage from the dump. The children eat stew, wash dishes, and then set off on a walk. Watch begins to bark. Uh-oh, do you think it's the intruder? No, it's a runaway hen. Benny finds a nest with some eggs, and as luck would have it, Jessie knows how to cook eggs. That's dinner sorted. Jessie cooks the eggs and they're delish. She thanks Benny for finding them.", "analysis": ""}
