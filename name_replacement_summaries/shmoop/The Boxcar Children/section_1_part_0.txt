Henry says he can carry Benny a long way, but Violet thinks they should wake him up--they'll move faster with Benny on his feet. Benny isn't exactly amenable to this plan, but when Violet turns it into a game where Benny pretends to be a little bear, he's totally on board. The children walk past dark farmhouses, and after a long time, the sun begins to rise. They decide they need to bed down somewhere. Benny is already asleep again in Henry's arms. Violet finds a haystack, and Henry declares it a great place to sleep. Sure, Henry. Sounds great. The children make sleep nests in the haystack and fall asleep right away. They're super tired. When they wake up, everyone is hungry. Guess what's on the menu? Bread. That's it. Benny is thirsty, but Henry thinks they need to wait for dark to find water. At nightfall, they make their way to a water pump and drink their fill. As they set off on the road, Jessie says they should hide in the bushes if they hear anyone--and then they immediately hear someone. Good timing, Jessie. The children hide in the bushes as planned. A horse and cart approach, and wouldn't you know, it's the baker and his wife. They're looking for the children. They say they're planning to look in Greenfield and then give up looking, which is useful info for the kids. After the baker and his wife are out of sight, the children emerge from the bushes and continue down the road. Around 2 a.m., they come to a crossroads. One road leads to Greenfield, while the other goes to Silver City. Knowing the plans of the baker and his wife, they choose Silver City. Eventually, they come to a water fountain. It has three levels: one for people, one for horses, and one for dogs. Water fountains used to be way cooler, apparently. Everyone drinks some water, and then Benny starts to complain about feeling tired. Classic Benny. Henry decides they will sleep in the woods. Jessie thinks this sounds like a great plan since the woods seem deserted. Clearly these kids have never seen a horror movie. The kids make beds out of pine needles and prepare to go to sleep. As they drift off, Jessie observes that it looks like it might rain.", "analysis": ""}
