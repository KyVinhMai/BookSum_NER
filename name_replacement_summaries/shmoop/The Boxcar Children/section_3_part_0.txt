Benny thinks it might be a bear; things are sort of tense. Oh, good, it's not a bear--it's just a dog with an injured paw. The dog hops over to Jessie, who removes a thorn from his foot and ties a wet handkerchief around it as a bandage. Jessie holds the dog so he can rest while the other children go to pick blueberries. After a while, Jessie goes over to help, still holding the dog. Oh, here's Henry--he brought milk and cheese and bread. Henry is psyched about the dog. He thinks the pup will make a great watchdog. Benny informs the group that the dog's name is Watch. Guess that's settled. It's time for dinner, so Jessie arranges the laundry bag into a tablecloth and cuts the bread and cheese into chunks. She also puts out the blueberries. Henry is psyched about those, too. Everyone eats dinner. There's some milk leftover at the end, which they'll have for breakfast. Jessie declares that they will sleep on beds--though by beds, she actually means pine needles. As they arrange their \"beds\" in the boxcar, Jessie plots out the space. She thinks there will be room for a kitchen and a sitting room. Jessie has a pretty active imagination. Time to wash up. Afterward, Jessie washes the towels and hangs them on a clothesline to dry. Jessie thinks they should have a little nightcap before bed, by which she means some water. Henry takes two empty milk bottles off to the water fountain, and after a few sips, everyone is ready for bed. It's hot, so they leave the door of the boxcar open.", "analysis": ""}
