Safie's Turkish father was accused wrongly of a crime , and sentenced to death in Paris. Meanwhile, Safie was on the lookout for a European man to marry. Why? Because her mom taught her that Muslim men treat women like property. Quick Brain Snack: this idea that Muslim cultures thought of women as little better than animals is a really common stereotype in English thought of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. It actually became an early argument for women's rights: Christians shouldn't treat women like property because, unlike those heathens over there, Christians believe that women have souls. It was a fun time. Anyway, Safie met Felix when he was visiting her father in prison, and they fell in love. At the time, Agatha, Felix, and the blind old man were respected and rich Parisians. Felix plotted to help Safie's father escape from prison, but he was discovered, and the family was exiled sans all their money. Safie's father tried to force her to move to Constantinople, but she ran away to Felix. These stories give the monster hope that Felix and De Lacey will be compassionate toward him, since they too have suffered injustice. He seems to have quite a sophisticated understanding of the human psyche for a monster who's never talked to another living being.", "analysis": ""}
