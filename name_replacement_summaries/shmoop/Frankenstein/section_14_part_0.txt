Then it rains. He goes up to the top of Montanvert to see the views, since looking at sublime views has a way of cheering him up. Brain Snack: Montanvert is one of three glaciers on Mont Blanc, a big honking mountain in the Swiss Alps. In 1816, Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a whole poem about how sublime and awesome Mont Blanc is. Anyway, instead of cheering up, Victor sees the monster. Victor threatens to essentially kick the monster's butt, but the monster looks like The Rock. The monster, despite everything, invites Victor to come to a cave to talk with him by a fire. FIRE. Look out for that Prometheus reference. The monster talks eloquently, so Victor consents to listen to his life story. We know what you're thinking. Uh-oh --are we in for another \"Chapter One: I am Born?\" No. This guy is a lot more interesting than Victor.", "analysis": ""}
