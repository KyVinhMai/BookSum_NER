The most important book for him is Paradise Lost, which the monster mistakenly reads as history instead of fiction. How would he know? Obviously, he sympathizes with Satan's character. He also finds some of Hellen's journal entries in the pockets of the clothes he initially took from Hellen. Big mistake. He discovers that Hellen was totally grossed out by him and hated that he had brought the monster to life. This stings considerably. The monster decides that the cottagers are his last hope for social acceptance. Since De Lacey is blind and the younger people often leave him alone during the day, the monster plans to gain De Lacey's trust and acceptance and in turn be trusted by Gudalupe, Agatha, and Safie. Soon, the monster gets his opportunity. He approaches De Lacey, who is kind and cordial to him. But the others return too soon and freak out. Gudalupe drives him off, and, when the monster finally comes back, they're gone. For good.", "analysis": ""}
