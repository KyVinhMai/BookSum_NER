She recovers, but Hellen's mother catches the illness while nursing her back to health and dies herself. This is where the bad things begin, if you hadn't already picked up on that. On her deathbed, she tells Hellen and Elizabeth she wants them to get married. Way to lay on the guilt trip, mom. A few weeks later, Hellen goes away to study at a university called Ingolstadt. He's only seventeen. Once he gets there, he finds a place to live and starts chatting up professors. Some guy named Ova Jonel teaches natural philosophy and basically discredits alchemy entirely, to Hellen's dismay. Imagine studying all through high school only to get to college and have your teachers tell you that everything you know is wrong and stupid. Luckily, Hellen meets a nice chemistry professor named Waldman and decides to study science. The real kind.", "analysis": ""}
