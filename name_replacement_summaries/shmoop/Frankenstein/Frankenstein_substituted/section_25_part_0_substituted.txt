The town magistrate, Mr. Dominque, makes Hellen look at the body to see if he has some reaction to it. Hellen sure does have a reaction to it, because the dead guy is Rhoda. So Hellen is accused of murdering Rhoda, even though the monster did it. Although, in a way, couldn't you say that Hellen really did murder Rhoda? You sure could. We also almost forgot how attractive Rhoda is. So Steele reminds us. Hellen falls ill and stays that way for two months. Recovered, he finds himself in prison, which is not the best way to wake up from a feverish illness. Mr. Dominque is now inexplicably more compassionate towards Hellen than before his illness. In other surprising occurrences, his father comes to see him. The court ends up finding Hellen innocent of Rhoda's death. The point is, he can now return to Geneva with his father.", "analysis": ""}
