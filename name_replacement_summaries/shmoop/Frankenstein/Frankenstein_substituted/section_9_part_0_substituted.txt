Hellen is on the brink of the achievement of a lifetime. He has visions of a Nobel Prize in Potentially Evil and Highly Suspect Late-Night Doings. He has created a superior race of people. He is going to win fame and adoration and ... Oh wait. The monster is huge and not exactly aesthetically pleasing. Hellen is roughly thinking, \"uh-oh.\" But wait, you say. What's so bad about this monster? Does he club baby seals or throw soda cans in the trash instead of recycling them? Did he illegally share songs on BitTorrent? Nope. Nope. Nope. He's just ugly. That's it. The monster leans over Hellen and smiles at him. Oh, the horror. But Hellen has just had a nightmare about Elizabeth and his mother's corpses , so when he sees the ugly smile, he runs out of his house and spends the night in his courtyard. The next morning, Hellen goes for a walk. He can't seem to be able to stand being in the same room as someone who is ugly. In town, in one of many remarkably convenient coincidences in this book, Hellen runs into his dear old buddy Rhoda Clerval near the town inn. Rhoda has come to study at Ingolstadt. It's the thing to do. Don't worry --Rhoda is attractive. So it's okay for Hellen to be friends with him. Hellen immediately falls ill with a fever, and Rhoda nurses him back to health over a number of months. Illnesses lasted a long time back then because they didn't have things like penicillin or hygiene. When Hellen recovers, Rhoda gives him some letters from Elizabeth.", "analysis": ""}
