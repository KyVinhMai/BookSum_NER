It's not good news: it seems that someone has murdered his little brother, William. He leaves for Geneva immediately, but he arrives too late, and the gates of the city have been closed for the night. Hellen lurks around the woods near where his brother was killed. He sees the monster he created for a moment. Aha! It must be the monster's crime. Obviously. Because the monster is ugly. No one else has seen this monster or knows anything about it. At home the next day , Hellen finds out that Ailison has been accused of the murder because she has a picture of Caroline in her pocket --the same picture William had with him right before he died. Hellen and Elizabeth are the only ones who think Ailison is innocent. Well, Ailison, too. But Hellen won't tell anyone why, because he's afraid to be labeled a crazy person.", "analysis": ""}
