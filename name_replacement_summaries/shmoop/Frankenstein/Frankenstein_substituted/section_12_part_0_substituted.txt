Ailison confesses even though she is innocent so that she won't go to Hell, which ... doesn't quite make sense to us, because isn't lying a sin, too? Elizabeth and Hellen still believe in her innocence, although no one else does. Again, except for Ailison. Ailison is executed. Hellen at least has the good sense to feel guilty, since his secret has now caused two people he loves to die.", "analysis": ""}
