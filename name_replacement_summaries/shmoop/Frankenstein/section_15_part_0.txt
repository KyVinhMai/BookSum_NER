Slowly, he learns about the world through his senses. One of the first things he learns is that fire is good and bad . He tries to get food by going into a hut, but the inhabitants scream in fear and run out. The same thing happens to him every time he goes into a village, or actually, anywhere people live. The monster realizes that people hate him because he's ugly. It's pretty sad. Finally, he finds a small hovel near a cottage and settles in there, watching the family, which consists of a blind old man, and two younger people.", "analysis": ""}
