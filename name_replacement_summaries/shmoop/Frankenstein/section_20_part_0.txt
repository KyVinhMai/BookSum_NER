{"name": "Chapter 16", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507234146/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/frankenstein/summary/chapter-16", "summary": "Seeing as everyone hates him for no fair reason, the monster swears revenge on all people, particularly that jerk who created him only to live miserably, ugly, and alone. Still, he can't help rescuing a little girl who slips into a stream and almost drowns. He's a hero, see? But when the man accompanying the girl sees the rescue, he assumes the monster is attacking the girl and shoots him. Not the nicest way to say thank you. The monster hides out in the woods, nursing his wounded shoulder. Things are not going so well for him. In another occurrence of astounding coincidence, the monster makes it to Geneva and runs into William Frankenstein, Victor's younger brother. Apparently shallowness runs in the family, because William reacts much the same way Victor did, calling the monster ugly and wretched. Still, the monster is about to let the kid go when William threatens him by saying that his father is Alphonse Frankenstein. Bad call. Realizing that William is related to his creator, the monster strangles him with his bare hands. The boy has a picture of his mother, Caroline. The monster takes it from William's dead hands and puts it in pocket of a girl sleeping near by. Any guesses who that girl is? Yep, it's Justine. Then, the monster tracks down Victor and asks him to create a mate so he won't be alone. We probably would have buttered up Victor differently than confessing to murdering his brother. Just a thought.", "analysis": ""}
