Mrs. Touchett, not one to be shocked, already knows - apparently, with her innate meddling radar, she could just feel it in the air. She disapproves, and blames Madame Merle for betraying her. Isabel doesn't see what Madame Merle has to do with anything . Mrs. Touchett complains that there is no reason to marry Osmond; he has neither name nor fortune. Isabel rather snootily responds that she doesn't need to explain herself, and, even if she wanted to, she wouldn't know how. Yeah, that sounds like love to us. Mrs. Touchett asks Isabel whether Ralph would have changed her mind. Isabel says that Ralph would disagree with anyone she chose to marry. Isabel tells Mrs. Touchett about Caspar visiting and leaving within one day. Two days later, Ralph arrives. Isabel waits for Mrs. Touchett to tell him, and for Ralph to bring up the engagement with her, but he does not. Ralph is hurt and saddened - the person he found the most intriguing has let him down. Ralph hopes to dissuade Isabel from going through with her engagement. Osmond has been meeting up with Isabel outside of Palazzo Crescentini every day. They walk in a quiet park together.", "analysis": ""}
