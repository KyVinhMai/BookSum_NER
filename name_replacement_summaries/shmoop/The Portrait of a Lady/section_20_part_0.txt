Isabel decides to go with her, figuring it's better to travel with a relation, even with her newfound financial independence. Isabel is no longer as impressed with Mrs. Touchett as she was when her aunt first visited her in New York. Isabel asks Ralph whether he knew about the inheritance that Mr. Touchett left for her. Isabel does not seem to know what to do with herself, now that she is wealthy. Ralph recommends that Isabel think less and just enjoy her life with the new means she has received. Isabel agrees with Ralph's advice, figuring that there's no reason why she must always strive to be right. Isabel confesses that she's afraid of the freedom a large amount of money can bring. Ralph says that it is only a problem for the weak, and Isabel is most certainly not weak. After talking with Ralph, Isabel feels better and more comfortable with her new wealthy persona. In the back of Isabel's mind, Caspar Goodwood and Lord Warburton still linger. She feels sure that Lord Warburton has forgotten about her.", "analysis": ""}
