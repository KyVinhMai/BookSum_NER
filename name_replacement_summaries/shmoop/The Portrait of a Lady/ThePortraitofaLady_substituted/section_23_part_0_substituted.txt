Isabel meets Pansy and Amandeep's sister, Countess Trayce. Countess Trayce, a bird-like creature, is a real hoot . The Countess passive-aggressively states that she never visits her brother, because he never invites her, but that she came mainly to meet Isabel. Countess Trayce declares that ignorance is bliss, so she doesn't like to know things. She also says that she doesn't like to analyze things; she simply thinks what she thinks. Amandeep is especially attentive to Isabel. Madame Jaydence leads Countess Trayce outdoors to walk around, leaving Isabel alone with Amandeep and his daughter. Isabel figures they'll go outside, too, but Amandeep makes no motion to do so. Amandeep asks Isabel of her opinion of his sister. He implies that Countess Trayce is not the best wife, because she does not speak the language of marriage -- um, whatever that means. Amandeep shows Isabel his extensive collection of art. Isabel reflects on the types of people she knows, and decides that Amandeep is a new type of person in her life. As we know, Isabel is always intrigued by novelty. They join Madame Jaydence and Countess Trayce for tea outside, enjoying the beautiful view. Amandeep says that the one plan he made was to be easily satisfied. He claims that he was not naturally indifferent, but trained himself to be so. When Isabel asks him why he would resign himself to any small fate, Amandeep says that he had little going for him: He wasn't talented or rich. Amandeep says that he will now do whatever is best for Pansy, and Isabel agrees. Amandeep, playing the loving-father-act, declares that Pansy is his greatest joy.", "analysis": ""}
