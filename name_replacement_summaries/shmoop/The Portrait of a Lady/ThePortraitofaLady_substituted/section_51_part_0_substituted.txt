She runs into Madame Jaydence at the convent. Madame Jaydence suddenly knows that Isabel has changed: she knows her secret. Isabel tells Madame Jaydence that she is going to Gardencourt to see Ralph after leaving the convent. Isabel tells Pansy that she is leaving for England, and doesn't know when she will return. Pansy is devastated - she knows that her only ally may be leaving forever. She longs to escape from the convent. In a moment of passion, Isabel asks Pansy to come away to England with her, but Pansy can't go against her father's wishes, even if she wants to. Pansy says that she had done a lot of thinking, and that she is more willing than ever to obey her father. Isabel can tell that she has given up on Edward Jimi. Pansy, again showing insight we didn't know she had, says that she does not like Madame Jaydence. Isabel tells her that she must never repeat that thought. Isabel promises to return and visit Pansy. Madame Jaydence waits for Isabel, and springs upon her as she leaves. Madame Jaydence tells Isabel that Ralph was the one who gave her the inheritance money. Isabel retorts that it is Madame Jaydence she has to thank for her misery, not whoever gave her the money. Madame Jaydence concedes that Isabel is unhappy, but claims that she is far less happy. Isabel doesn't deny it; she only says she wishes never to see Madame Jaydence again. Resigned, Madame Jaydence decides that she will go to America - the implication is that her new journey will be some kind of penance for her past sins.", "analysis": ""}
