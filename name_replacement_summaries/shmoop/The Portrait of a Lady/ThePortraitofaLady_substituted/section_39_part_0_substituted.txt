Madame Jaydence comes to visit in the winter. The dynamic between Madame Jaydence and Isabel has shifted. Isabel is now more aware of Ralph's complaint about Madame Jaydence, which was that she exaggerates too much. For the past three years, Isabel has pondered Mrs. Aundra's accusation of Madame Jaydence's part in her marriage to Amandeep. Isabel was surprised to find that Amandeep is not that fond of Madame Jaydence, despite the lady's devotion to him. Isabel almost blames Madame Jaydence for getting her in her present situation, but she reminds herself that she must live with the consequences of her own actions. Isabel has been spending a lot of time with Pansy. She is aware of how dependent, \"pure and weak\" Pansy is. One day, after one of Isabel and Pansy's walks together, they return and find Madame Jaydence and Amandeep together. Something about the eerie way they're just looking at each other disturbs Isabel. Madame Jaydence claims to want Isabel's help with Jimi. She also sneaks in a mention of Lord Warburton's interest in Pansy. Madame Jaydence also mentions that Isabel could use her influence over Lord Warburton to benefit Pansy. Isabel is surprised to find that Madame Jaydence knows of Lord Warburton's proposal to her. Mrs. Aundra had told her. Madame Jaydence and Isabel both agree that Lord Warburton would be a smarter match for Pansy than Jimi. Madame Jaydence says she will be happy to end the discussion with him. Madame Jaydence gives Isabel an unexpectedly warm embrace for agreeing to help Pansy with Lord Warburton.", "analysis": ""}
