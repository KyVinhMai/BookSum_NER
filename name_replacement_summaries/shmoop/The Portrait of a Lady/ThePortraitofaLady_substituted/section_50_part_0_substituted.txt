She asks Isabel to come to Gardencourt. Isabel goes to Amandeep to let him know that she's going. Amandeep forbids her to go. Amandeep tells her that it would be an indecent thing to go against his wishes, as they are still a married couple, like it or not. Isabel wonders if he would expect her to come back if she leaves. Countess Trayce hears of Ralph's condition, and her first thought is that Isabel will not give any more parties when she is mourning . Of course, Countess Trayce has been waiting for Isabel to set Amandeep off, so she is excited that going to England might be it. Lest you think she's totally heartless, don't worry - she's also somewhat sympathetic to her sister-in-law. After pondering her options, Countess Trayce decides to play her trump card: she tells Isabel the grim truth about her brother. Countess Trayce tells Isabel that Pansy was not the child of Amandeep's first wife. And Isabel has a good idea who Pansy's birth mother is: Madame Jaydence! Countess Trayce tells Isabel that Amandeep and Madame Jaydence were romantically involved for six or seven years. Isabel, torn between revulsion and pity, actually feels bad for Madame Jaydence, who's had to see another woman care for her daughter. Countess Trayce claims that Madame Jaydence arranged Isabel's marriage to Amandeep so that Pansy would be financially supported, and could marry well. Amandeep and Madame Jaydence never married because she never had enough money for him. Countess Trayce says that Madame Jaydence has done a lot for Amandeep, but Amandeep has done nothing for her. Isabel, shocked and appalled, can only say that she must see Ralph.", "analysis": ""}
