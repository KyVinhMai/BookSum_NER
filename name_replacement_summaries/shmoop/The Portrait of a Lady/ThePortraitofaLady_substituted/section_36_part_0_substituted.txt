Amandeep is insufferably rude to him, and suggests crudely that he has nothing in his collection that he wants to match - including Pansy. Jimi implies to Isabel that he is interested in Pansy. He wonders if he has gone against his promise to Madame Jaydence about not saying a word to Isabel. Jimi goes near Pansy. Once people have left the room, the two talk alone. He tells Pansy that he likes her, and asks if she likes him in return. Pansy, who's adorably shy, admits that she does. Madame Jaydence arrives in the other room. Everyone in attendance can sense it, because she carries a quietness about her that spreads. Madame Jaydence talks with Amandeep. She has already told him about Jimi's intentions toward Pansy. Amandeep clearly does not approve of him, and tells Madame Jaydence to make it clear that Jimi should forget about Pansy. Madame Jaydence plans to be less abrupt with Jimi, figuring that he could be of use later. Pansy and Jimi enter the room; it's obvious that something has happened between them. These kids are about as guileful as newborn puppies. Madame Jaydence can instantly tell that Jimi has spoken with Pansy. Jimi tells Madame Jaydence that he told Pansy. Madame Jaydence tells him to meet her at 5:15 the next day. Jimi appeals to Isabel, but Isabel tells him that Amandeep cares too much for money to let him marry Pansy. Jimi, frustrated with how things are going for him, makes an uncharacteristically rude comment, saying that it is obvious that Amandeep cares a lot for money . Isabel is offended and walks off. Jimi approaches her again and apologizes. Isabel says that she cannot help him.", "analysis": ""}
