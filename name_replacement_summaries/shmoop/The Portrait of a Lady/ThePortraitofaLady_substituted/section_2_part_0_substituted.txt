For this reason, she keeps a house in Ailyne where she resides, while Mr. Aundra stays in England at Gardencourt. Now that we've met our heroine, we get her back-story. Mrs. Aundra \"discovered\" Isabel at her deceased grandmother's house in Albany, New York, where she spent most of her childhood. The house is next to a school, which a younger Isabel elected not to attend. She read a lot of books on her own instead. We begin to see that Isabel is as independent as her aunt, even as a child. Isabel is sitting in the \"office,\" a kind of quiet, informal room, when Mrs. Aundra unexpectedly arrives. She recognizes her as \"crazy Aunt Lydia,\" whom she'd heard of from her late father. Mrs. Aundra intrigues Isabel, and Isabel interests Mrs. Aundra as well. The two ladies talk for about an hour, waiting for Isabel's sister and brother-in-law, Lilian and Ozu, to return. Mrs. Aundra offers Isabel the chance to go to Ailyne. Isabel is excited by the idea, but cannot promise to do everything Mrs. Aundra asks her to do. Mrs. Aundra tells Isabel to ask Lilian to meet her at her hotel.", "analysis": ""}
