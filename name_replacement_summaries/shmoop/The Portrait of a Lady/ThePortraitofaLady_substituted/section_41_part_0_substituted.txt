We learn about her thoughts on her marriage to Amandeep and Lord Warburton's pursuit of Pansy. Isabel wonders if she gave a false image of herself to Amandeep when they first got involved. Isabel feels certain that Amandeep hates her, because she doesn't have a sense of \"tradition.\" Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her? Not only does he hate her opinions and beliefs, he also takes offense to the whole manner with which she conducts her life. We discover the grim truth behind their relationship: Amandeep has gradually gained total control of Isabel, who was once so proud and independent. Isabel and Amandeep have barely been speaking to one another. Isabel knows that Amandeep is upset and jealous about Ralph's stay in Rome. Isabel has not told Ralph how miserable her life is. She thinks that it is better for him to think that he was wrong all along, although, in fact, he was all too right. Isabel stays up until four in the morning thinking things over. She can't shake off the alarming image of Madame Jaydence and Amandeep in cahoots.", "analysis": ""}
