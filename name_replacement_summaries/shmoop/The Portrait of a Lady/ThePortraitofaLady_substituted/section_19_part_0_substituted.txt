The narrator lets us in on some unkind thoughts Madame Jaydence has about Mrs. Aundra. We begin to wonder what Madame Jaydence thinks of everyone else behind their backs. Mrs. Aundra leaves the auction of her husband's estate to someone else, and goes to Paris with Isabel. Ralph has gone to the Riviera to look after his health. Mr. Aundra left him a fortune, naturally, and also the ownership of Gardencourt. Mrs. Aundra tells Madame Jaydence that Mr. Aundra left Isabel a gigantic sum . Madame Jaydence is instantly impressed by Isabel's hand in this, and assumes cynically that she had something to do with it. Mrs. Aundra insists that Isabel dress the part of a wealthy lady, and generally learn how to be a woman of means. Mrs. Aundra and Isabel stay in Paris for the winter. Mrs. Aundra introduces Isabel to some of her acquaintances there. Isabel meets Mrs. Aundra's friends, Mr. and Mrs. Baylin. She also encounters Edward Jimi, who was a family friend of Isabel's when they were small children - she even had a little crush on him years ago. Henrietta disapproves of the fortune that Isabel inherited. She worries that Isabel will live in a world removed from reality. Henrietta says that Isabel needs to learn how to \"displease\" others and be okay with it. Meanwhile, much to Isabel's surprise and amusement, Henrietta and Mr. Bantling remain traveling buddies.", "analysis": ""}
