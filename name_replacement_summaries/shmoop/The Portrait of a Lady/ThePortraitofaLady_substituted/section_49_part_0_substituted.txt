This way, Isabel has a chance of listening to Countess Trayce ramble about something other than social gossip. Pansy joins them on this particular trip to the Coliseum. Isabel sees Jimi there, who tells her that he has sold all of his art collection , and that he has earned fifty thousand dollars for them. He expects that Amandeep will find him rich enough. Isabel responds that, now, Amandeep will find him an idiot for selling his precious collection. She says that Amandeep hopes to marry Pansy off to a nobleman. Isabel sees the Countess Trayce and Pansy return, so she quickly ends the conversation with Jimi. Pansy sees Jimi, but doesn't make eye contact; she's as obedient as ever. This doesn't bode well for poor Jimi. Seeing this, Isabel pities her old friend - she's glad that he at least kept his enamels for comfort. The Countess stays behind to talk with Jimi, and Pansy and Isabel go on without her. Pansy later goes to Isabel's room to tell her that Amandeep's returning her to the convent. Isabel was not consulted. Amandeep tells Isabel that it's best for Pansy to be sequestered away, so she can think things through. He is worried that Pansy has been soiled by her contact with the world - she's no longer the perfect collector's item that she was before. Isabel is saddened to see how Amandeep is willing to do anything, including ruining his daughter's prospects of happiness, in order to show his power. Countess Trayce seems to think that Amandeep has sent Pansy away so that she wouldn't be jealous: Countess Trayce has taken a liking to Jimi. Amandeep responds casually and menacingly that if he felt that his sister was interfering, he would just have her sent away.", "analysis": ""}
