Isabel is open to the idea of Pansy marrying the lord, but thinks of what a shame it is that Jimi will be hurt. She wants to please Amandeep. We're disturbed by her abused-wife mentality.... Isabel considers leaving Lord Warburton and Pansy alone, but decides to stay in the same room. Amandeep comes into the room after Pansy's left. He asks if Lord Warburton has gone. Amandeep, for whatever reason, is certain that Isabel will side with Pansy marrying Jimi. The couple obviously has an antagonistic relationship. Amandeep commands that Isabel to use her pull with Lord Warburton to get him to propose to Pansy.", "analysis": ""}
