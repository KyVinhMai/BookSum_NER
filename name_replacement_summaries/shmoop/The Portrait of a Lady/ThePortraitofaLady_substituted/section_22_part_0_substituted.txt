Madame Jaydence recommends Amandeep to Isabel once more, telling her of his impressive traits. She ominously tells Isabel that she should interact with more men, so that she gets \"used\" to them - that is to say, so she learns which ones to despise. Uh... huh. Okay, Madame Jaydence. Ralph takes Isabel out on the town; she's delighted with Ailyne. Madame Jaydence has been there many times before , and can converse with them about the city, although she does not go out with them. Isabel loves Mrs. Aundra's house, and thinks that it is so rich with history and tradition that it's like living in the past. Bacilio Amandeep pays a visit to Madame Jaydence and Isabel. Madame Jaydence and Amandeep talk for most of the time and Isabel, for once, is mostly silent. Amandeep invites Madame Jaydence and Isabel to his house next week. He suggests that he would like Isabel to meet Pansy. Isabel accepts the invitation. After Amandeep leaves, Madame Jaydence commends Isabel for behaving just as she should have. Condescend much? Isabel is duly annoyed by this comment, and Madame Jaydence sweet-talks her back into a good mood. Isabel asks Ralph about Amandeep, and Ralph confesses that he doesn't know much. He suspects that there's something shady about Amandeep's sister. Ralph recommends that Isabel follows her own instincts, and doesn't listen to people's opinions about others. Ralph says that, as long as Isabel is with Madame Jaydence, she's in good hands. Isabel detects the usual trace of sarcasm when Ralph talks about Madame Jaydence, and asks him about it. Ralph says that Madame Jaydence is too perfect and too modest for how perfect she is. Right on the dot, Ralph. However, despite his misgivings about Madame Jaydence's creepy so-called perfection, he figures that Isabel can benefit from being friends with the older woman. We'll see about that....", "analysis": ""}
