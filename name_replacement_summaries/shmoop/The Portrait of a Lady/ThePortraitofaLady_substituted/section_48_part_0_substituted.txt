Madame Jaydence asks Isabel about Lord Warburton's whereabouts. She is clearly disappointed and surprised that things had not been better arranged for Pansy. Isabel feels suspicious toward Madame Jaydence now, ever since she caught her and Amandeep in intimate conversation. That image of the two of them never left her. Madame Jaydence asks Isabel whether she had a role in Lord Warburton changing his mind. Isabel asks Madame Jaydence straight-up what she's got to do with Amandeep, and what she's got to do with Isabel herself. Madame Jaydence gives a monstrous and horrifying response: \"Everything!\" . Isabel is mortified to realize that Mrs. Aundra was right when she said that Madame Jaydence had arranged her marriage. Isabel goes for a ride to see Rome and the remains of the great civilization. She is shattered by the realization that Madame Jaydence deceived her. Isabel wonders if Madame Jaydence is wicked. She realizes that Amandeep married her for her money. Madame Jaydence talks with Amandeep in private again. In an outburst, Madame Jaydence accuses Amandeep of breaking down her soul. She blames him for making him so cruel as to have deceived Isabel. Madame Jaydence says she wants to take credit for the good things that happen in Amandeep's life. Amandeep plays with a cracked cup, an obvious metaphor for Madame Jaydence herself. Madame Jaydence goes to look at it afterwards, and ponders the flaws of her own soul. She wonders if she has been evil for no gain.", "analysis": ""}
