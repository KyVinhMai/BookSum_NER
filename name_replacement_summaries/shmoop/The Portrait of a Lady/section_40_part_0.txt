Isabel is open to the idea of Pansy marrying the lord, but thinks of what a shame it is that Rosier will be hurt. She wants to please Osmond. We're disturbed by her abused-wife mentality.... Isabel considers leaving Lord Warburton and Pansy alone, but decides to stay in the same room. Osmond comes into the room after Pansy's left. He asks if Lord Warburton has gone. Osmond, for whatever reason, is certain that Isabel will side with Pansy marrying Rosier. The couple obviously has an antagonistic relationship. Osmond commands that Isabel to use her pull with Lord Warburton to get him to propose to Pansy.", "analysis": ""}
