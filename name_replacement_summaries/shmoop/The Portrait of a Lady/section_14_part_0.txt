She thinks that Englishmen have their uses. Ralph accompanies Isabel and Henrietta to London. The ladies stay at Pratt's Hotel, while Ralph stays in one of the Touchett family's other houses at Winchester Square. Henrietta is disappointed by the lack of rich people. She wonders where all the members of the aristocracy are. Ralph devotes a lot of thought to Isabel; she's still a fascinating mystery to him. Isabel delights in their visits to museums and parks. Henrietta seems less enthused, but is not as cynical as one might expect. Ralph introduces the ladies to his friend, Mr. Bantling. Henrietta immediately takes a liking to Mr. Bantling, and becomes excited when he offers an invitation to his sister Lady Pensil's house. Henrietta leaves with Mr. Bantling to have dinner with two female friends. Isabel and Ralph are left alone in Winchester Square. Isabel says that she will eat dinner alone, and Ralph should return to his room to rest. Ralph is confused by her wish to be alone, and asks whether she plans on meeting someone. She claims that she knows no one to meet. Ralph tells Isabel that Lord Warburton has told him about the proposal and her response. He does not wish to argue with her, only to hear her explanation, as a cousin and friend. Isabel, a bit defensive, says that she doesn't think a woman's life should begin by marrying someone. She would like to see Europe first, for one thing. Ralph says that Isabel has a great deal of courage, though Isabel denies such a thought. Ralph helps Isabel find a cab, as she insists that he go back and rest. Ralph laments his handicapped state.", "analysis": ""}
