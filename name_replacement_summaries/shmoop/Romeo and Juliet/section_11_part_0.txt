When the Nurse comes back, she plays a little game by refusing to tell Juliet anything and complaining about her aching back. Finally, the Nurse gives in and tells Juliet to run to Friar Laurence's cell where Romeo is waiting so they can get hitched. Before the scene ends, the Nurse says she'll \"fetch a ladder\" for Romeo to climb up so the lovers can spend their wedding night together. She also manages to turn her description of Romeo \"climbing\" the ladder into Juliet's \"bird's nest\" into an image of the kind of sex the couple is going to have later that night.", "analysis": ""}
