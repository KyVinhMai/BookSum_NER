Luckily, it's a costume party, so they can wear masks. Romeo and Mercutio trade insults and there's some naughty talk about love, in particular, what to do to when \"love pricks like a thorn.\" Mercutio's solution? \"If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\" Translation: The solution to heartache is to go out and have sex. Romeo continues to boo-hoo about the unavailable Rosaline and then he announces that he had a dream the night before. Before he can go into the details, Mercutio interrupts and delivers a long, crazy speech about \"Queen Mab,\" a tiny fairy who visits people in their dreams. Romeo says Mercutio is talking nonsense and Mercutio, our resident skeptic, retorts that dreams are for idiots. Before entering the party, Romeo says he has a feeling that \"fate\" may have something bad in store for him.", "analysis": ""}
