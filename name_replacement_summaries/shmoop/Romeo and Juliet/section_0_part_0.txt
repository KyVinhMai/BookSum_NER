The setting is \"fair Verona,\" a town in Italy where two rival upper-crust families have been feuding for as long as anyone can remember. We're also told how the children of these two families will fall in love, but the story's not going to be a happy one. Before the play is over, our infamous \"star-crossed lovers take their life\" , which will put an end to their parents' feud. Finally, the Chorus invites us to sit back and relax while we enjoy the \"two-hours' traffic of stage,\" which is sixteenth-century theater speak for \"the next two hours it's going to take for the play to be performed.\" Brain Snack: In director Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film adaptation of the play , the Chorus is replaced by a TV anchorwoman who delivers the lines as an evening news story.", "analysis": ""}
