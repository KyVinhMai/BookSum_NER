But Juliet's nurse first delivers a long, semi-bawdy speech about Juliet's infancy and toddler years. Her rambling, tangent of a speech reveals the following information: the Nurse had a baby named Susan who was about Juliet's age but, sadly, she died. The Nurse is not only Juliet's nanny but she also her wet-nurse. When it was time to \"wean\" Juliet, the Nurse put \"wormwood\" on her breast. Also, Juliet once fell down and cut her forehead when she was little, which the Nurse's late husband thought was hilarious--so hilarious that he turned the accident into a dirty joke about how Juliet would eventually grow up and then fall down and have sex with a guy. This is ... a lot of information. Lady Capulet eventually cuts her off and tells her to \"hold her peace.\" Lady Capulet unloads the news that Paris has been sniffing around for Juliet's hand in marriage. Eyeroll. Just check Paris out at the party that night, Lady Capulet says. He'll be the oh-so-dreamy guy all the other girls are swooning over. Speaking of, Peter, the servant, enters to announce that guests are beginning to arrive for the big bash.", "analysis": ""}
