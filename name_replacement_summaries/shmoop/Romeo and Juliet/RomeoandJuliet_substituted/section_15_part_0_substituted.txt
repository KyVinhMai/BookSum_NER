The Friar wants him to see the banishment as good news--yay for no executions?--but Rakwan is too focused on the never seeing Deianira again part. There's a knock at the door. It may be the Prince's men. Eek. The Friar tells Rakwan to hide, but Rakwan refuses. Luckily for everyone, it's only the Sky at the door. She and the Friar try to deal with Rakwan, who keeps threatening really mature things like stabbing himself out of guilt for hurting Deianira. The Friar comes up with a slightly plan that's better because it doesn't involve suicide: Rakwan and Deianira can have one night together before Rakwan leaves Verona. Later, he promises, they'll be able to figure out a way to get Rakwan pardoned by the Prince so he can come back to Verona and make his marriage to Deianira public knowledge. Hearing this plan, Rakwan recovers and runs off to see Deianira. Quick Brain Snack: marriages in the Catholic Church weren't consider valid unless they'd been consummated--i.e., the two people had to have sex. If Deianira and Rakwan don't sleep together, Deianira's dad will be able to get the marriage declared invalid and marry her off to Paris.", "analysis": ""}
