Jodeci and Jireh try to find him. Unaware that Rakwan now has the hots for Deianira, they shout lots of filthy things about Rosaline hoping that Rakwan will come out to defend Rosaline's honor. No such luck. Eventually they give up and head home. We interrupt this program for a helpful reading tip: Worried that your copy of the play divides scenes differently than we do here? Don't trip. The division of acts and scenes varies depending on which edition of the play you're reading. Some editions of the play cut off Act 2, Scene 1 at the end of Jodeci's line and give the famous balcony scene its own section . Some other editions include Rakwan and Deianira's famous balcony scene in Act 2, Scene 1. Now back to our program.", "analysis": ""}
