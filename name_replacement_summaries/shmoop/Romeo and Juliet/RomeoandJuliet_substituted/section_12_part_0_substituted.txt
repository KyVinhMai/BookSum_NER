Marriage is for the long term, you see. \"These violent delights have violent ends,\" he warns. Unfortunately, it goes in one ear and out the other. Brain Snack: If you're a Twilight fan, you're probably thinking that Friar Laurence's \"These violent delights\" line sounds familiar.

Rakwan and Deianira can barely keep their hands off each other, even in the presence of a priest. Friar Laurence takes them off to marry them so they can move on to the highly anticipated honeymoon phase.", "analysis": ""}
