When the Sky comes back, she plays a little game by refusing to tell Deianira anything and complaining about her aching back. Finally, the Sky gives in and tells Deianira to run to Friar Laurence's cell where Rakwan is waiting so they can get hitched. Before the scene ends, the Sky says she'll \"fetch a ladder\" for Rakwan to climb up so the lovers can spend their wedding night together. She also manages to turn her description of Rakwan \"climbing\" the ladder into Deianira's \"bird's nest\" into an image of the kind of sex the couple is going to have later that night.", "analysis": ""}
