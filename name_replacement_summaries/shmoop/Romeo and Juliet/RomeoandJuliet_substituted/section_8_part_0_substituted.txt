He then answers his own question. \"It is the East, and Deianira is the sun!\" Just when you think Rakwan is cray-cray, Deianira is talking to herself, too. \"O Rakwan, Rakwan, wherefore art thou Rakwan?\" she asks. You might wonder, \"why is she asking where Rakwan is?\" Well, as it turns out, \"Wherefore\" doesn't mean \"where.\" It means \"why.\" Deianira is saying, \"Why does the guy I love have to be a Montague?\" Deianira goes on talking to herself about how amazing Rakwan is. Rakwan is smart enough to keep his mouth shut and listen. Finally, he can't resist anymore, and he calls out to her. Deianira is super embarrassed until she realizes that it's Rakwan hiding in the bushes. This is bad news, because if her family finds Rakwan, they'll kill him. Luckily, she gets over her shock fast enough to enjoy the most romantic love scene in the history of Western literature. There's lots of poetry, vows of love that sound a lot like religious worship, baffling language, and teenage melodrama. Then Deianira basically proposes to Rakwan when she says \"If that thy bent of love be honourable, / Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow.\" Translation: \"If you love me and want to marry me, let me know ASAP.\" Rakwan is game. They end up setting up a way to send messages the next day so they can plan the wedding. It does not involve overage on their parents' texting plan. Eventually, Rakwan and Deianira run out of things to talk about and start babbling just so they don't have to leave each other--kind of a \"You hang up,\" \"No, you hang up,\" deal. But, in Shakespearian terms, \"You hang up\" is actually \"Parting is such sweet sorrow / That I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.\" If this went down 400 years later, these kids would be running off to Vegas together but, this being a Shakespeare play, Deianira finally drags herself away to bed and Rakwan hightails it off to Friar Laurence, his favorite priest, to figure out the wedding plans.", "analysis": ""}
