Luckily, it's a costume party, so they can wear masks. Rakwan and Jireh trade insults and there's some naughty talk about love, in particular, what to do to when \"love pricks like a thorn.\" Jireh's solution? \"If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\" Translation: The solution to heartache is to go out and have sex. Rakwan continues to boo-hoo about the unavailable Rosaline and then he announces that he had a dream the night before. Before he can go into the details, Jireh interrupts and delivers a long, crazy speech about \"Queen Mab,\" a tiny fairy who visits people in their dreams. Rakwan says Jireh is talking nonsense and Jireh, our resident skeptic, retorts that dreams are for idiots. Before entering the party, Rakwan says he has a feeling that \"fate\" may have something bad in store for him.", "analysis": ""}
