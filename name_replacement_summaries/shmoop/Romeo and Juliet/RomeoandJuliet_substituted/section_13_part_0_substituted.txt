Jodeci and Jireh are hanging out as usual, trading insults and mocking the Capulets. Trouble materializes in the form of Tybalt, who is trying to find Rakwan so he can get back at him for crashing the Capulet party. Tybalt provokes Jireh by saying \"Jireh, thou consortest with Rakwan,\" which means \"You're a known associate/friend of Rakwan.\" It also kind of implies that Rakwan and Jireh are sleeping together. Jireh responds that he's going to make Tybalt \"dance\" with his \"fiddlestick\" and yes, there's a sexual innuendo at work here, swords being phallic symbols and all. Jodeci, who wants everyone to be friends, warns the guys not to fight in public. And then in stroll the just-married Rakwan. Insults are exchanged, but Rakwan remembers that Tybalt is his new wife's cousin, so he turns the other cheek. Jireh finds this totally shocking--actually dishonorable--so he offers to fight Tybalt instead. So they fight. Rakwan tries to intervene, but Tybalt stabs Jireh. Rakwan and Jodeci assume that Jireh hasn't been badly hurt because he starts joking about his wound--but it's no joke. He's dying. He then gives us the famous line, \"A plague on both your houses,\" and then turns to BFF Rakwan and says, \"Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm,\" he says. A minute later, he is dead. Rakwan blames himself for Jireh's death and laments that his love for \"sweet Deianira\" \"hath made effeminate\" . So, he decides to man up. By challenging Tybalt to a duel. And killing him. Oops. Jodeci tells him to run away before the Prince captures him, and Rakwan gets away just before all the citizens of Verona miraculously show up at the scene of the duel. The Prince arrives and is, uh, a little angry. Remember how he said that anyone caught fighting would die? After Jodeci explains what happened, Lady Capulet demands to Rakwan be killed. But Yoltzin Montague argues that Tybalt got what was coming to him for killing Jireh. The Prince comes up with a solution: because Tybalt started the fight, he'll spare Rakwan's life. But he rules that Rakwan must be banished from Verona. Man, and he was just getting ready for his honeymoon.", "analysis": ""}
