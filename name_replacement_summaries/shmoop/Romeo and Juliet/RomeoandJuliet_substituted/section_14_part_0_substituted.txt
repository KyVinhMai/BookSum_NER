{"name": "Act 3, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210514145017/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/romeo-and-juliet/summary/act-3-scene-2", "summary": "Deianira, who hasn't heard about the whole murder/ revenge killing thing, is watching the clock for nightfall, when Rakwan is supposed to sneak into her room. When the Sky enters, Deianira realizes right away that something has gone wrong. First, Deianira thinks Rakwan has been killed. Nope: her husband has just murdered her cousin. Deianira's first reaction is to curse Rakwan, and the Sky joins in--but you know that isn't going to go over well, and it doesn't. Deianira turns on the Sky and tells her she can't criticize her husband. If he hadn't killed Tybalt, then Tybalt would have killed Rakwan. Forced to choose between the cousin she has loved all her life and her new husband, she chooses Rakwan. Teenagers, right? Just as she's decided to forgive Rakwan, she remembers that he's been banished and starts flipping out. Deianira is wailing about the fact that she'll die a virgin when the Sky tells her Rakwan isn't gone yet. He's hiding out at Friar Laurence's. The Sky promises to find him so he and Deianira can have their night of passion before he has to hit the road.", "analysis": ""}
