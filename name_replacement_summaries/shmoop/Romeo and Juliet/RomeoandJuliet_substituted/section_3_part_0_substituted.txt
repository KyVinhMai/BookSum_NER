But Deianira's nurse first delivers a long, semi-bawdy speech about Deianira's infancy and toddler years. Her rambling, tangent of a speech reveals the following information: the Sky had a baby named Susan who was about Deianira's age but, sadly, she died. The Sky is not only Deianira's nanny but she also her wet-nurse. When it was time to \"wean\" Deianira, the Sky put \"wormwood\" on her breast. Also, Deianira once fell down and cut her forehead when she was little, which the Sky's late husband thought was hilarious--so hilarious that he turned the accident into a dirty joke about how Deianira would eventually grow up and then fall down and have sex with a guy. This is ... a lot of information. Lady Capulet eventually cuts her off and tells her to \"hold her peace.\" Lady Capulet unloads the news that Paris has been sniffing around for Deianira's hand in marriage. Yael. Just check Paris out at the party that night, Lady Capulet says. He'll be the oh-so-dreamy guy all the other girls are swooning over. Speaking of, Elvia, the servant, enters to announce that guests are beginning to arrive for the big bash.", "analysis": ""}
