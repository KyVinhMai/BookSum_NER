Rosaline, who he once said he'd die for, didn't stand a chance when compared to Deianira. What the Nesta adds, you probably could have guessed--namely that it's going to be hard for Rakwan, a Montague, to get much quality time with Deianira, a Capulet. But...their passion makes them determined, and in time they'll find a way to meet up. Thanks, Nesta! Now we're ready to move on.", "analysis": ""}
