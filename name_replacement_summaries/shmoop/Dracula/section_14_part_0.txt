{"name": "Chapter 15", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219141110/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/dracula/summary/chapter-15", "summary": "Dr. Seward is totally blown away that Van Helsing could say something like that about Lucy. Besides, she's dead. Van Helsing says he'll prove it: They'll go spend the night in the churchyard. After dinner, they go into the Westenra tomb. Van Helsing pulls out a screwdriver to open the coffin. Lucy's not in it! Dr. Seward still has a logical explanation: Someone has stolen the body. Van Helsing shrugs, and they go out to the churchyard to wait. Several hours later, Dr. Seward sees something white moving among the trees, and Van Helsing finds a child that had been dumped in the leaves. They leave the child with the police and go back to London. Van Helsing wants Dr. Seward to come out and check the coffin again. This seems pretty stupid to Dr. Seward, who has already seen that the coffin is empty. But when they get there, Lucy's body is inside! And her body is totally intact, even though she's been dead a week. Dr. Seward finally gets it: Lucy is a vampire. And he's okay with stabbing a stake through her heart and cutting off her head, if that's what it takes. But Van Helsing wants to let Arthur in on the secret, in case he finds out about it later. Van Helsing leaves a note for Dr. Seward saying that he's going to spend the night in the churchyard watching Lucy. He's leaving the note in case anything happens to him. He asks that Dr. Seward take over if he should die, and try to find and kill Dracula. After a good night's sleep, Dr. Seward doesn't believe it anymore--he thinks maybe Van Helsing is crazy. Van Helsing has summoned Arthur and Quincey. He wants them all to wait up that night in the churchyard, go into Lucy's tomb, and cut off her head. No problem, right? Of course, Arthur objects. But they agree at least to go with him to the churchyard.", "analysis": ""}
