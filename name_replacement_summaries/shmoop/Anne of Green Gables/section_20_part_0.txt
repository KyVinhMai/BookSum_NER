Mr. Phillips is leaving the Avonlea school and the church is getting a new minister, who has a wife. Said wife, Mrs. Allan, takes over Anne's Sunday school class and lets the students ask her questions, so of course Anne loves her. Marilla decides to invite the Allans over for supper and tells Anne she can make a cake. Anne gets a little obsessive over the cake. She's made good cakes before, but she's worried she'll screw it up somehow. The day of the visit arrives. Anne has a cold, but her cake rises the right way and she arranges a bunch of flowers for the table, so things are looking up. Dinner goes well, but when Mrs. Allan tries the cake, she gets a funny expression. Marilla figures out that instead of vanilla, Anne accidentally flavored the cake with anodyne liniment, a painkilling medicine that involves morphine and alcohol. Awkward. Anne runs to her room, but Mrs. Allan is very kind about the whole thing and the night ends well.", "analysis": ""}
