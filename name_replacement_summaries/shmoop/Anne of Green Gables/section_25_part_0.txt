Fast forward a few weeks to when Anne turns thirteen. She and Diana are walking through the woods talking about their composition assignments. They're supposed to write a story. Diana's daunted by the assignment, but Anne's already done hers. Anne tells Diana her entire amazingly melodramatic story. It's about two friends, Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour, who love the same man, Bertram DeVere. We won't spoil the ending for you, but it's a tragedy. Anne and Diana start a story club where they write stories for practice. Eventually they add two other friends, Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis. Jane's stories are too sensible, Ruby's have too much love in them, and Diana's have too many murders . But they all have a good time. They also send the stories to Josephine, who's very amused.", "analysis": ""}
