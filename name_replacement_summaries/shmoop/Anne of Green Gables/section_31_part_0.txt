Anne travels to Charlottetown to take them. In a letter to Diana, Anne describes everyone's initial fear right before the test starts, and how she thinks she's done on the tests so far. She secretly wants to beat Gilbert. All the kids in town are waiting to find out who scores higher. The pass list is supposed to come out in the paper. Anne waits in agony for three weeks. Diana manages to get her hands on a paper from a nearby town and runs it to Anne. Anne tied with Gilbert for first place, out of everyone on Prince Edward Island. Woo-hoo! Before they leave to tell their friends, Anne finds Matthew, Marilla, and Mrs. Lynde near the house and gives them the news first. Matthew says he knew it, Marilla tries to hide her extreme pride, and Mrs. Lynde says, very sincerely, \"We're all proud of you.\"", "analysis": ""}
