In addition to classes, students have field afternoons where they study nature and \"physical culture\" exercises. Anne loves it. Marilla thinks it's nonsense. Miss Stacy organizes a concert for the kids to perform in on Christmas night. Anne will speak in two scenes and has two solo recitations. Remember how anti-concert Marilla is? She rolls her eyes about the whole thing, especially since Anne's anticipation makes her excitable and not useful in the kitchen. But you can count on Matthew, who reassures Anne that she'll be great.", "analysis": ""}
