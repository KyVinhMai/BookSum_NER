The scene is set: the girls are in the Barry garden after tea. They soon start daring each other to do things. In Avonlea, it's completely taboo to refuse a dare. Anne scorns Josie Pye when Josie successfully walks a fence in response to a dare, saying it isn't that impressive, and she knew a girl who could walk the ridgepole of a roof. See where this is going? Josie dares Anne to walk the ridgepole of the Barry roof. Diana begs Anne to refuse, but Anne's too proud. She tells Diana she can have her pearl bead ring if she dies, and climbs up to the roof. Anne walks a few steps, and then falls off. Luckily, she falls off the side where the roof extends low over a porch, so she doesn't die. But she's in a lot of pain. Mr. Barry has to carry her home. When Marilla sees Mr. Barry carrying Anne limp in his arms, she realizes she loves her. Not that she says so. But she's scared. Anne explains what happened, then faints from the pain. The doctor pronounces her ankle broken. He sets it, but she has to stay in bed for several weeks. Anne has many visitors for the next three weeks, but she's excited to get back to school and meet their new lady teacher.", "analysis": ""}
