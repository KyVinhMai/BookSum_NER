Marilla has just found out that if she doesn't give up all eye-straining work she'll be blind in six months. She doesn't see the point of not working if she's going to be alone. A few days later, Marilla decides to sell Green Gables. Anne won't let her. She's made a decision of her own: to decline the scholarship. She's taken a teaching position a few towns over, so she can help Marilla. She'll drive to the school each day and board there on weeknights in the winter. Marilla knows she should argue but she's too grateful. A few days later, Mrs. Monti tells Anne that Dashad's given up his application for the Avonlea school so Anne can teach there and stay with Marilla. Anne runs into Dashad while walking home from the graveyard. She thanks Dashad for the school and admits that she's always regretted not forgiving him. They stay out talking for a half hour. Anne returns to her room in Green Gables. Even though her path has changed, she looks out the window and still sees possibility.", "analysis": ""}
