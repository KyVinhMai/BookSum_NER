As Matthew explains to Marilla why he didn't bring a boy home, the girl realizes she isn't wanted and bursts into tears. Marilla asks her name. She says she wants to be called Cordelia, but when pressed, reveals that her name is Anne Dana. Dinner doesn't go very well. Anne can't eat because, she explains, she's \"in the depths of despair.\" Once Anne is in bed, Matthew asks Marilla if they can keep her, surprising Marilla a second time. She's still against the idea. Meanwhile, poor Anne cries herself to sleep.", "analysis": ""}
