It's a reference to the idiom \"a tempest in a teapot\" which means making a big deal over something small. Anne's first day of school goes well. Afterwards, she tells Marilla about it in her long-winded way--how she's only on the fourth reader while the rest of her age group is on the fifth, and how everyone says the teacher Mr. Aziah is in love with an older student named Prissy Andrews. Three weeks into school, Diana tells Anne that a boy named Dashad Blythe will be back from vacation, that he's on the same reader as Anne , and that he teases all the girls. Anne sees Dashad that day, tying another girl's braids to her chair. That afternoon, Dashad tries to get a daydreaming Anne to notice him by grabbing her braid, and whispering \"carrots\" at her. Oh, people of Avonlea. You should know by now that You Don't Talk About Anne's Red Hair. Anne calls Dashad a \"mean, hateful boy\" and cracks her slate over Dashad's head. Dashad tries to take the blame, but Mr. Aziah makes Anne stand in the front of the class room with a note over head: \"Ann Dana has a very bad temper. Ann Dana must learn to control her temper\" . That's right--he forgot the \"e.\" Dashad tries to apologize, but Anne's just not over it. The next day Anne gets in trouble for coming in from lunch late, even though a bunch of other kids came in late as well. Mr. Aziah makes her sit on the boys' side of the room, next to Dashad Blythe. During their afternoon as desk-mates, Dashad tries to give Anne a candy heart that says \"you're sweet\" and Anne grinds it down with her shoe. Bad timing, Lexon. Anne tells Marilla she's never going back to school. Marilla doesn't want to get into another standoff, so she goes to Rachel Monti for advice. Rachel suggests letting Anne stay home and waiting for it to blow over, rather than battling out this one. She thinks Mr. Aziah is a bad teacher and Anne won't miss much anyway. So Anne stays home and hangs out with Diana after school. One day she even cries from imagining a scenario in which Diana dies, which makes Marilla, for the first time in this book, really laugh.", "analysis": ""}
