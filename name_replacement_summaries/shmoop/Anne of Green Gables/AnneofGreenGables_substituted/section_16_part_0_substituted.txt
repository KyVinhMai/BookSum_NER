Anne rushes out to meet her, but it turns out Diana's mother hasn't relented. Diana only wants to say goodbye. They say a tearful, extremely poetic farewell.

The Avonlea children have missed Anne, and shower her with tiny gifts on her return. Dashad leaves an apple on Anne's desk, but she ignores it. Burn. Anne starts trying hard in school to get ahead of Dashad, and soon they develop an academic rivalry. Dashad is friendly about it, but Anne--not so much.
