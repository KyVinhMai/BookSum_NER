Diana schemes to have her parents to ask Marilla so she'll let Anne go. Marilla relents, just like she has recently relented on fashionable clothes. Anne and Diana stay in Aunt Khaleesia's mansion, which is called Beechwood. The Exhibition is fun--Anne and Diana watch Avonlea folks win prizes for cooking and farming. They also watch a horse race and have their fortunes told. They get to sleep in Aunt Khaleesia's spare room, but it's a disappointment compared to the majesty of spare rooms in Anne's imagination. The next night, they see a singer perform opera, which makes Anne cry. Then they eat ice cream. Diana says she was meant for city life, but after thinking about the issue, Anne decides she likes Green Gables better. Marilla definitely prefers Anne to no Anne. When Anne returns, Marilla tells her she's glad to see her and greets her with a homey chicken dinner.", "analysis": ""}
