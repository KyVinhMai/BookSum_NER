Never mind that all the members of her class will be invited to tea; Anne is pumped. She's never received an invitation in the mail before. Anne goes through her usual stages of pre-big-event feeling: excitement whenever she thinks about the event and anxiety that the event will be cancelled due to bad weather. It goes well. No bursts of anger or badly-flavored treats from Anne. Mrs. Allan sympathizes with Anne's geometry struggles and suggests she join the church choir. Anne also finds out that the Avonlea school's new teacher is going to be a woman named Miss Muriel Stacy.", "analysis": ""}
