When she gets home, Anne isn't there and nothing is started. Marilla isn't scared. She's annoyed. She preps tea and rants to Matthew. Later, she goes to Anne's room to find Anne hiding out in her bed. Anne's reluctant to emerge at first but eventually shows Marilla her hair. Which is green. Apparently, a peddler came to the house and sold Anne a dye that he said would be raven black. In other words, Anne got played. Marilla tries to wash the dye out, but it sticks. So Marilla cuts Anne's hair, very close to her head. Anne realizes she's been vain about her hair, despite its red color. She vows to stop caring about her looks from now on.", "analysis": ""}
