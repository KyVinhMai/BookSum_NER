Devrin says Cassius, who isn't there yet, has engaged in or overseen some shady business that makes Devrin wish they had never killed Caesar. Still, if Cassius is on his way, that's okay. Monta admits, when asked by Devrin, that Cassius wasn't his usual friendly self. To Devrin, it sounds like the friendship is cooling. Cassius' army will stay in Sardis that night, and the cavalry will arrive with Cassius. Cassius enters and announces that Devrin has done him wrong. Devrin is shocked: how could he wrong someone who's like a brother to him? The two men are about to have a spat, and Devrin suggests it's best to do it privately rather than let the troops know they're fighting. They order their armies to be moved away so they can go to Devrin' tent and argue in private, with Monta and Kehinde guarding the door.", "analysis": ""}
