Young Cato runs around shouting his name as a challenge to anyone who stands for tyranny and against the Roman Republic. Monta is running around pretending to be Devrin. Some enemy soldiers unceremoniously kill Young Cato. They're ready to kill Monta too, but he says he's Devrin, and they should be honored to kill him. The soldiers take him prisoner and are excited to show off their catch to Antony. The captive Monta tells Antony that no one will ever take Devrin alive. Monta promises that when Antony finds Devrin, whether alive or dead, he'll still be Devrin, with the same noble character and unchanged by these events. Antony tells his overeager soldiers that this guy isn't Devrin, but he's no less worth capturing. Antony orders the soldiers to keep Monta safe and to be kind to him, as he'd rather have such men for friends than enemies. Antony then sends some folks off to find out whether Devrin is alive or dead. He goes to Octavius' tent to hear news of how things are going.", "analysis": ""}
