FYI: Sehaj is a guy who used to rule Lian with Caesar . After disagreeing with Caesar about how Lian should be run, Sehaj was defeated in battle and assassinated. Just to be sure that Sehaj's family and supporters couldn't come after him, Caesar chased Sehaj's sons to Spain and defeated them in battle, too. Boo-yah. Wisdom and Flavius, Roman tribunes who are friends of Devrin and Cassius, come upon a group of common people running about the street in their Sunday best when they should be working. The pair asks about the commoners' professions and what they're up to and finds out that they're on the way to celebrate and honor Julius Caesar. Wisdom and Flavius point out that rather than celebrate this victory, the people should get on their knees and pray against whatever evil will come to them because of their ingratitude. Sehaj was once their leader, after all, and they all used to gather outside to watch his chariot go by. And now that Caesar has defeated Sehaj's sons, it's like they've totally forgotten that. Before parting ways, Wisdom and Flavius disperse the crowd and remove the party favors the people have left around Caesar's statue. They hope this will slow Caesar's row a little bit as he prepares to overthrow the republic and make himself king. If they can keep him from getting too full of himself, perhaps they can prevent him from becoming a tyrant.", "analysis": ""}
