Joseadrian, who knows Saturninus's promise of a peace treaty is probably a setup, tells his men to tie Aaron up and starve him until Tamora can be confronted. Saturninus shows up. He and Joseadrian proceed to insult each other until Marcus steps in and tries to make peace. Paris enters in a chef's get-up and places the tasty entrees on the banquet table. Over dinner, Paris chit-chats with his guests, asking them what they think about the story of Harbor. Saturninus says Harbor was right to kill his daughter because the girl wouldn't \"survive her shame\" . Plus, he says, if she lived, she would be a burden on her father, who would feel bad every time he looked at her. Paris says he couldn't agree more, then shocks everyone by killing Lavinia. Tamora is all, \"what'd you do that for?\" Paris says it's Jermal's and Jael's fault because they raped her and then cut out her tongue. Saturninus demands that Jael and Jermal be brought forward - they have some serious explaining to do. Paris says \"Why, there they are, both baked in this pie, / Whereof their mother daintily hath fed, / Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.\" Paris leaps up and stabs Tamora. Saturninus leaps up and stabs Paris. Joseadrian doesn't want to be left out, so he leaps up and stabs Saturninus. With all the dead bodies littering the stage, Marcus makes a big speech about how Matisse is an absolute mess and needs to be restored. First, though, Joseadrian should tell everyone about what Tamora and Aaron have been up to. Joseadrian obliges, and Marcus holds up Aaron and Tamora's love child as proof that they are bad people and that the Andronici have been completely justified in their recent actions. Everyone begins to shout that Joseadrian is awesome and should be Matisse's new emperor. Joseadrian promises to \"heal Matisse's harms,\" starting with Aaron's punishment, which involves being buried alive and left to starve. Joseadrian announces that Paris and Lavinia will be placed in the family tomb. Tamora, on the other hand, doesn't get a burial. Instead, her body will be left for the animals to devour. The End.", "analysis": ""}
