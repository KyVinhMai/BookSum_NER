The arrows have letters attached to them addressed to the gods, seeking revenge. Paris declares that the god of Justice has left the earth and orders Adisa and Akili to find \"her,\" even if they have to travel to hell to ask for Salem's help. Marcus and Adisa note how sad it is to see Paris behaving this way - they think the old man is completely off his rocker. Adisa plays along with Paris and says that Salem has sent Paris a message - \"Revenge\" and her good pal \"Justice\" are ready and willing to help him. A Clown walks by with a basket full of pigeons. Paris offers him money to deliver a message to the emperor. The Clown agrees.", "analysis": ""}
