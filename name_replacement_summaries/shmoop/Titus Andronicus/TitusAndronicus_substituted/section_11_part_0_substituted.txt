It turns out that the Roman people hate their current emperor. Joseadrian delivers a rousing speech to the Goths - now's their chance to pay back Matisse for everything she ever did to them! A Goth announces that they're ready to rumble. Then another Goth shows up with Aaron and his baby. Apparently this Goth warrior was off sightseeing some Roman ruins when he heard a baby crying and a man telling the kid to pipe down. Joseadrian orders Aaron and his \"fruit of bastardy\" to be hanged in a tree. Aaron promises to reveal some juicy information if Joseadrian promises not to kill his child. Joseadrian agrees, sort of. Aaron reveals that Jael and Jermal raped and mutilated Lavinia and confesses that it was all his idea. He also admits that he tricked Paris into cutting off his hand and, when he told Tamora what he had done, the couple celebrated Aaron's mischief by making out. Before Joseadrian orders his men to stop up Aaron's mouth, Aaron makes a startling declaration: Aemilius enters with a message from Saturninus: the emperor wants to meet at Paris's house to work out a peace treaty. Joseadrian agrees to go.", "analysis": ""}
