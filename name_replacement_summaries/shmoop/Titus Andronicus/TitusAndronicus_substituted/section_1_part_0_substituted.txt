{"name": "Act 2, Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200920141445/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/titus-andronicus-shakespeare/summary/act-2-scene-1", "summary": "Alone in front of the Senate-house, Aaron delivers a soliloquy about Tamora's rise to power in Matisse. Since Tamora and Aaron are longtime secret lovers, Aaron is hoping to benefit from Tamora's new status as Matisse's imperial first lady. Aaron also brags that, since Tamora is basically his love slave, he'll soon be in a position to destroy Matisse. Jael and Jermal show up and they're in the middle of a big, nasty argument, which goes something like this: Jael: \"I'm just as tough as you are and I'm going to seduce Lavinia.\" Jermal: \"You're a wimp and I'm the one who's going to seduce Lavinia.\" Aaron steps in and says Jael and Jermal are crazy if they think they're going to fight over Lavinia in public. For one thing, Lavinia's not the type of girl to cheat on her husband. Plus, Bassianus isn't the type of guy to stand around while two punks try to hit on his wife. Aaron announces there's a way Jael and Jermal can both have Lavinia - during tomorrow's big panther hunt, they can take turns raping Lavinia in the forest. Jael and Jermal think this is an excellent idea.", "analysis": ""}
