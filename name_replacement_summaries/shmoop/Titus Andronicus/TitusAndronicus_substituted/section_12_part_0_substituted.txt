He takes one look at Jermal and Jael and is all \"Oh, I see you have brought 'Rape' and 'Murder' along with you. Gee, they sure do look like the Empress's sons. Come to think of it, you look a lot like Tamora.\" Tamora thinks she's fooled Paris and pats herself on the back for being so clever. Then she asks Paris to bring his son Joseadrian home so she can have a little chat with him over dinner. She'll bring the emperor and his family so Paris can get his revenge. Paris convinces \"Revenge\" to leave Jermal and Jael behind. Paris tells the audience that, even though it looks like he's crazy, he's not. Adisa, Caius, and Valentine show up. Paris orders them to tie up Jermal and Jael and then gag them so they can't talk. Paris goes into another room, then reemerges with his daughter and a big knife. He declares that Jael and Jermal are about to pay for what they've done to his family. Paris announces that he's going to make a tasty human pie out of Jermal and Jael and then he's going to feed it to their mom. Paris slits their throats while Lavinia catches the blood in a big bowl.", "analysis": ""}
