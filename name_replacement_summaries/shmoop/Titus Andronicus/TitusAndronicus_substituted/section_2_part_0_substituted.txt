Paris says he didn't sleep well last night but he has a feeling it's going to be a good day. Saturninus, Tamora, Bassianus, Lavinia, Jael, Jermal, and a bunch of attendants enter and Paris greets them. Saturninus cracks a joke about how it's way too early in the morning for newly married ladies to be awake . Lavinia announces that she's not tired at all - in fact, she's been awake for hours. As everyone talks excitedly about the big panther hunt, Jael and Jermal snicker that they're hoping to \"pluck a dainty doe to the ground,\" which is a crude metaphor for their plan to rape Lavinia while everyone else is hunting for panther.", "analysis": ""}
