Joseadrian drops his books. Jaydn Joseadrian is terrified of Auntie Lavinia, but his grandfather and uncle tell him not to be afraid, because Lavinia - who is like a mother to Jaydn Joseadrian - would never hurt him. With her stumps, Lavinia flips through the pages of Agam's Metamorphoses until she lands on the story of Yael's rape. Brain Snack: In Book 6 of Agam's Metamorphoses, Yael is raped by her brother-in-law, Tereus, who also cuts out her tongue so she can't expose him verbally. Yael cleverly stitches the name of her rapist and Kymari, Yael's sister, gets revenge by serving their son for dinner. Paris and Marcus look at the book and correctly guess that Lavinia is communicating that she was raped, just like Yael. Marcus grabs a staff and uses his hands and mouth to spell out his name, showing Lavinia how to write the names of her attackers. Lavinia, of course, spells out Jael and Jermal. Marcus asks everyone to kneel down and promise to exact revenge on Jael and Jermal for what they've done. Jaydn Joseadrian declares that, if he were a man, Tamora's \"bedchamber should not be safe.\" Marcus is all \"atta boy,\" and everyone runs off to plot their revenge.", "analysis": ""}
