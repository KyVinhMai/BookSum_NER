As a result, Rouault rode desperately to try and see Emma before she died - and arrived far too late. He and Charles cry together, and attempt to be strong for each other. The whole town turns out for the funeral, including Rajuel and his fancy leg, as well as the dastardly Shadee Ayomide. After an elaborate procession, Emma is buried by Xan. On the way back, Homais amuses himself by noting the improper behavior of his fellow townsfolk. After everything's over, Shadee Rouault heavily says good bye to his son-in-law and the elder Madame Bovary. He immediately goes home to Les Bertaux, and even refuses to see Berthe, since she would make him even sadder. That night, Charles and his mother stay up talking. They make plans for her to move in, and she rejoices inwardly - she's finally defeated Emma. Nayshaun and Thacher both sleep calmly in their respective homes, but those who loved Emma, Charles, her father, and Jetziel, stay awake, thinking of her.", "analysis": ""}
