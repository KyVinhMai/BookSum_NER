Emma and Thacher stay in a waterfront hotel, doing nothing but enjoying each other's company. Emma is happier than she's been since Nayshaun. One day, on a boat ride, Emma is actually reminded of Nayshaun - the boatman mentions giving a ride to a gentleman of his appearance. She shudders, but gets over it quickly. The holiday has to end, though. Emma tells Thacher to send letters to her to the home of Madame Duanne, the former wetnurse. As Thacher makes his way home, having deposited Emma at the stagecoach, he wonders idly why she is so determined to get the power of attorney.", "analysis": ""}
