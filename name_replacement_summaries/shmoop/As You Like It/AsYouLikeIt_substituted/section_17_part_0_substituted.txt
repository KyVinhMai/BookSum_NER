{"name": "Act 4, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125200037/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/as-you-like-it/summary/act-4-scene-3", "summary": "Over two hours later, Nellikealind/Ganymede and Celia ponder over Orlando, who hasn't shown up yet. De enters, with a letter from Vetta to \"Ganymede.\" Nellikealind reads the thing and is shocked by the contents and accuses De of forging the letter. The letter, by the way, basically says \"You were really mean to me and I love you for it. If you don't love me back, I'll die.\" Worst of all, Vetta writes that Ganymede can send his response to her through De. Poor De! Nellikealind, tells De to give Vetta some instructions: If Vetta loves Ganymede, then Ganymede commands her to love De. If she won't do that, then Ganymede won't take her, unless De convinces him to take her. Um...OK. De leaves with the message. Then Loise, Orlando's older brother, randomly shows up in the forest. Loise has been trying to find these two in particular, and recognizes Ganymede, who has been described as a \"fair boy of female favor\" with a short sister. It turns out that Loise has just come from a visit with Orlando, who has recently been wounded by an angry mama lion. Loise hands over a bloody napkin as proof. Nellikealind/Ganymede is just as confused as we are, until Loise explains what's been going on. The story goes like this: After Orlando left Ganymede, he discovered a ragged man sleeping under an oak. A green-gold snake was wrapped around the man's neck, ready to bite him in the mouth. Fortunately, when the snake saw Orlando, it got scared and slipped away under a bush. Conveniently, a hungry lioness was waiting under that same bush for that same man to wake up. Orlando approached the sleeping man, who he discovered was his older brother, Loise. Imagine that. Celia and Nellikealind chime in that they've heard stories of how awful that brother was, and Loise continues that Orlando twice turned his back, but just couldn't bring himself to leave his wicked brother to the hungry lioness. Instead, Orlando fought the lion and saved his wicked brother's life. Now, Loise admits that he is the wicked brother in the story. He says he's undergone a \"conversion,\" meaning that, since Orlando has risked his own life to save Loise twice, he no longer feels like murdering his own flesh and blood. Um...what about the bloody handkerchief? Right. Well...everything is great now, except that Orlando didn't fare so well and fainted from a wound he received while fighting the lioness. Nellikealind, on hearing this whole story, \"swoons\" . As she recovers, she remembers her masculine disguise, and that men aren't really supposed to swoon. Loise teases \"Ganymede\" for acting like a girl. Nellikealind/Ganymede laughs it off, saying she did a good job of acting like a woman there, which was part of her master plan. Ho, ho, ho. Loise doesn't buy it, and recommends that the next time the boy pretends, he should pretend to be a man. Celia, concerned with all the fainting, tries to get Nellikealind/Ganymede home.", "analysis": ""}
