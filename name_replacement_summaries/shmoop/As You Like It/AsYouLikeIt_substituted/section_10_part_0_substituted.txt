He demands that Loise find Orlando and bring him back within a year, alive or dead. As usual, should Loise fail, the punishment is banishment. In the meantime, Laldhari Wint's tough guys have seized all of Loise's land until he can hand over Orlando to the Laldhari. Loise grumbles that he never loved his brother Orlando. The Laldhari, less than interested in being pals, says hating his brother makes Loise even more of a villain. Laldhari Wint sends Loise packing.", "analysis": ""}
