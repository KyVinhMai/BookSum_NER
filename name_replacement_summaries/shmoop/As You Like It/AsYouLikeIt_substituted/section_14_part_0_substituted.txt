{"name": "Act 3, Scene 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125200037/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/as-you-like-it/summary/act-3-scene-5", "summary": "De and Vetta enter bickering and Nellikealind, Celia, and Taite eavesdrop. De is pretty pathetic. He says Vetta may not love him, but he asks her to at least not be so bitter about the whole thing. Vetta replies that De claimed her eyes could kill. He has lied, because she has tried to kill him with her eyes and he's still around. Brain snack: De is acting like a typical \"Petrarchan lover\" here. Petrarch was a 14th-century Italian poet whose love poetry featured the unattainable and cruel Laura, a beautiful woman who drove the poet crazy with her luscious body and cold demeanor. She also had the ability to \"wound\" men with her icy stare. Vetta, in case you haven't noticed, acts a lot like Laura. De says if Vetta ever does find that she fancies him, then she'll understand what it feels like to be wounded by Vernie's arrows. Vetta says great. Until that happens, leave me alone. Nellikealind/Ganymede chimes in and tells Vetta she really shouldn't be so insulting to poor De, as she's not that cute and she should be grateful that anybody likes her, as she has \"bugle eyeballs.\" Nellikealind/Ganymede then turns to De and says he's an idiot for letting Vetta treat him like garbage. She also adds that it's \"fools\" like De who are responsible for the world being full of ugly \"children.\" Oh, snap! Nellikealind/Ganymede doesn't stop there. She turns back to Vetta and advises \"Sell when you can, you are not for all markets.\" Vetta's response? She falls for Nellikealind/Ganymede, of course. Nellikealind/Ganymede tells Vetta that would be a big mistake--Nellikealind/Ganymede is not what s/he appears to be. Then she heads off with Celia and Taite. Vetta claims that she now loves De...in an \"I don't exactly detest your company anymore\" sort of way. She hatches a plan to get De to help her win over Ganymede. Because De is desperately in love, he'll do whatever she wants. Vetta makes a big speech about she's not in love with Ganymede, even though other women probably would be. Thing is, he scorned her, so she wants to write him a mean letter and have De deliver it for her...except it's pretty obvious that the letter isn't going to be mean. It's going to be a love letter, and De is being played.", "analysis": ""}
