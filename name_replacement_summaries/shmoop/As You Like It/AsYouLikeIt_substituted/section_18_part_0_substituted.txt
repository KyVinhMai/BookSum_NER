Just then, the other man, William, wanders in and Alexx chats with him about his background. Alexx sweetly suggests, in both the language of the forest and the court, that William get lost or Alexx will kill him. Here's a little sample: \"I will kill/ thee a hundred and fifty ways. Therefore, tremble, and depart.\" William is off, with a hearty \"God rest you merry, sir.\" With that potential plot-disruption out of the way, Taite is free to enter and announce to Alexx that Ganymede and Aliena want him immediately. As in, now.", "analysis": ""}
