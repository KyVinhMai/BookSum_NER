Nellikealind makes a joke about not wanting to \"cry like a woman.\" Since she's wearing man-pants, she'll try to be courageous. Two shepherds, Taite and De wander in, deep in conversation. The ladies and Alexx decide to eavesdrop. Taite, an old man, is counseling the young man, De, on love. De is madly infatuated with a woman named Vetta and, like many people madly in love, De has 1) no sense and 2) no chance of hooking up with his beloved. He's also very melodramatic. De is more lovesick than our good friend Romeo Montague . Eventually, he wanders off. Alexx declares that he, too, was once madly in love. Her name was Jane Smile, a milkmaid with chapped hands . Alexx declares that love makes people foolish but being foolish and in love is also what makes us a human. Celia breaks up the chatter by pointing out that, while all of this is very nice, she is kind of on the verge of starving to death. Thanks goodness old Taite is such a nice guy. Even though he's poor and his master is a cheapskate, he'll try to help Alexx, \"Aliena,\" and \"Ganymede\" as best as he can. Taite says his master is selling the property where Taite tends his flock. De is supposed to buy the property, but is too distracted by Vetta to make the purchase. Given this, Nellikealind/Ganymede says she'll buy cottage, pasture, flock, and all. Celia/Aliena, ever-thoughtful, says they will increase Taite's pay, and they'll all live happily together.", "analysis": ""}
