{"name": "Act 3, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125200037/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/as-you-like-it/summary/act-3-scene-4", "summary": "Still in the forest with Celia, Nellikealind gushes for a bit over Orlando, who has such pretty red-brown hair. Nellikealind, however, is upset--Orlando promised to show up that morning to pretend-woo \"Ganymede\" and still hasn't arrived. Celia suggests that maybe he's no longer in love with Nellikealind. Celia points out that love is fickle, and tells Nellikealind she heard that Orlando has been passing time in the forest with the exiled Laldhari Arien, Nellikealind's own father. Nellikealind, you may have noticed, has not mentioned seeing her dad yet, and now she tells us she met him yesterday, joked with him a little bit, and left, never revealing she was actually his daughter and not a country boy. She sighs that there's no reason to discuss her father when there's Orlando to discuss instead. As Nellikealind moons about being love-struck, Taite enters and asks them if they'd like to see a funny scene: a faithful lover being scorned and destroyed. They'll get this tasty little entertainment treat if they just follow him. Nellikealind is eager to see it, as at the moment she's all about love and scheming about her own involvement in others' affairs.", "analysis": ""}
