The problem is, she doesn't have a good epilogue. What's more, she's not sure this was a good play. So, she invites the women in the audience to like the play as much as they can for the love of their men. Then she asks the men to do the same--for the love of their women. Finally, she says that if she were indeed a woman she'd kiss everyone in the audience with a nice beard, pleasing complexions, and good breath.", "analysis": ""}
