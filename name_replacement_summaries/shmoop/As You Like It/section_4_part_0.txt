Frederick concludes that some court members were in on the girls' escape, and is informed that Touchstone the fool is also missing. One of Celia's maids speculates that Orlando probably went off with the girls as well, since they were so impressed with his wrestling skills. Duke Frederick demands that Orlando be brought to him and, if Orlando is nowhere to be found, then his brother Oliver should be brought in to find the young man.", "analysis": ""}
