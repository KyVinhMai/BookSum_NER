Audrey hopes that her desire to be a married woman isn't immodest. Two of Duke Senior's pages find them and agree to sing a little song for the occasion. They sing about what happens in the country every spring--the birds sing and couples have sex in rye fields. Brain Snack: The Barenaked Ladies did a version of this song for a 2005 production of the play. Touchstone, ever the romantic, finds the tune badly sung and senseless. He teases that, though the pages kept musical time, they've wasted his time. Zing! Then he's off with Audrey.", "analysis": ""}
