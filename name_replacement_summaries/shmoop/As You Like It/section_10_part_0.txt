He demands that Oliver find Orlando and bring him back within a year, alive or dead. As usual, should Oliver fail, the punishment is banishment. In the meantime, Duke Frederick's tough guys have seized all of Oliver's land until he can hand over Orlando to the Duke. Oliver grumbles that he never loved his brother Orlando. The Duke, less than interested in being pals, says hating his brother makes Oliver even more of a villain. Duke Frederick sends Oliver packing.", "analysis": ""}
