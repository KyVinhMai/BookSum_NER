Rosalind, however, is upset--Orlando promised to show up that morning to pretend-woo \"Ganymede\" and still hasn't arrived. Celia suggests that maybe he's no longer in love with Rosalind. Celia points out that love is fickle, and tells Rosalind she heard that Orlando has been passing time in the forest with the exiled Duke Senior, Rosalind's own father. Rosalind, you may have noticed, has not mentioned seeing her dad yet, and now she tells us she met him yesterday, joked with him a little bit, and left, never revealing she was actually his daughter and not a country boy. She sighs that there's no reason to discuss her father when there's Orlando to discuss instead. As Rosalind moons about being love-struck, Corin enters and asks them if they'd like to see a funny scene: a faithful lover being scorned and destroyed. They'll get this tasty little entertainment treat if they just follow him. Rosalind is eager to see it, as at the moment she's all about love and scheming about her own involvement in others' affairs.", "analysis": ""}
