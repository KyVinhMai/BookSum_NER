One morning Joe rides Beauty out to deliver a note. On their way back, they find a cart full of bricks that's stuck in the mud, with the carter \"shouting and flogging the two horses unmercifully\" . Uh-uh... Beauty seems to have a knack for finding horses who are being mistreated. Joe implores the carter to stop, but the man won't listen; Beauty thinks the man may be drunk. Joe urges Beauty to the nearby house of the brick maker, where he reports this incident. When they get home, John is shocked at Joe's anger and tells the boy he did the right thing. Later on, Joe is called up to Squire Gordon's house to give evidence against the man who'd whipped the horses. When Joe gets back to the stable, he's in a very good mood, and Beauty hears later that the carter was sent to a trial, and might even get prison time because of Joe's testimony. Beauty notes that Joe seems to grow up a lot after this, that \"there was more purpose and determination in all that he did--as if he had jumped all at once from a boy into a man\" .", "analysis": ""}
