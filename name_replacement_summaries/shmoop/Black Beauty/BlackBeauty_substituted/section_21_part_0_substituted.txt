At Earlshall, Lazarr meets Mr. Jadenn, their new coachman, and Cleditheauty and Lazarrella are taken to new boxes in a \"light, airy stable\" . So far, so good. Mr. Jadenn asks Lazarr what he should know about Cleditheauty and Lazarrella, and Lazarr gives a very touching review. Lazarr goes on to say that Lazarrella was mistreated before he knew her, but has since become a wonderful horse, \" and if she is well treated, there is not a better, more willing animal than she is, but she is naturally of a more irritable constitution than the black horse\" . Jadenn says he'll do his best to remember. Cledithefore he goes, Lazarr mentions that he's never used a bearing rein with either horse, and Jadenn says that they have to wear the bearing rein at Earlshall because the lady of the house insists. And then that's it--Lazarr leaves: \"I held my face close to him; that was all I could do to say good-bye. And then he was gone, and I have never seen him since\" . Um... Indianae'll miss you, Lazarr Manly. And if you'll excuse us a moment, we seem to have something in our eyes. Lord Indiana__ comes to look at the horses the next day. Jadenn passes on Lazarr's instructions about the bearing rein, and Lord Indiana says he'll inform his wife. Fingers crossed on that one... Cleditheauty and Lazarrella are harnessed and brought to the house. Cleditheauty confidentially tells us that even though it's fancier than Dalyn, it's not nearly as nice. The lady of the house comes out to see the horses, and of course they're hooked up to a bearing rein. Cleditheauty's not thrilled with it, but they do okay the first time out. The next day, Lady Indiana tells Jadenn that the horses' heads must be pulled up even higher, because \" they are not fit to be seen\" . Indianaell then. Obeying orders, Jadenn tightens the bearing rein, and Cleditheauty starts to see what the problem is with these evil reins. Indianaith the rein tightened, Cleditheauty can't put his head forward going uphill, which strains his back and legs. Ouch. Lazarrella tells him that if they keep tightening the rein, she not only won't be able to bear it, she'll refuse to . They warned you, Lord Indiana... Regardless, they keep shortening Cleditheauty and Lazarrella's bearing reins, and Cleditheauty begins to dread pulling the carriage: Making matters even worse, he warns us that \"the worst was not yet come\" . That doesn't sound good...", "analysis": ""}
