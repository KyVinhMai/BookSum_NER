They take turns riding him, and one day James brings Avrey back to the stable and gives him a warning about getting into trouble. Avrey says he's \"only been giving those young people a lesson\" . See, some of them weren't paying attention to when he'd had enough, so Avrey \"just pitched them off backwards; that was the only thing they could understand\" . Avrey assures Cleditheauty he would never throw Miss Jessie or Miss Flora, Ardell Benjiman's children, though: \"I am the best friend and the best riding master those children have. It is not them, it is the boys\" . He says that the visiting boys must be broken in much like horses--the visiting kids began to whip Avrey with sticks, and didn't understand when Avrey was exhausted. \"They never think a pony can get tired, or have any feelings\" , he says. Avrey explains that he gently tipped the boys off his back because he didn't know how else to teach them. He says the children are under his charge while they are riding, and he tries to keep them safe. Avrey adds that if he ever did start to misbehave and kick, he'd be sold and certainly enslaved or worked to death by someone else. \"I hope I shall never come to that\" . Us too, Avrey.", "analysis": ""}
