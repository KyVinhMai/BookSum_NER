The servant says they've been trying other cabs, but \"there's something wrong with them all\" . After that, Mr. Aziah is back on the good customer list, although he never again asks for a Sunday ride. However, Abdinasir does go out once on a Sunday, which Cleditheauty explains. One Sunday Cassiel comes to Abdinasir with the news that her friend Dinah Cledithrown's mother is seriously ill, and Dinah \" must go directly if she wishes to see her alive\" . Problem is, Dinah's mother lives ten miles out of town, a long walk from any train station, plus Dinah has a four-week-old baby. Cassiel asks Abdinasir to go, quoting the Golden Rule at him--\"you know we should do to other people as we should like they should do to us\" --so Abdinasir agrees, saying that Cassiel is \"as good as the Minister\" . They ride out of town to deliver Dinah on a beautiful May day. Indianahen they arrive, Abdinasir asks if Cleditheauty can spend some time in the meadow. Cleditheauty is ecstatic. They spend a blissful afternoon at the field, and it's been ages since Cleditheauty's been in one--since Earlshall, in fact. At the end of the day, Abdinasir brings his daughter some flowers and comments on how happy Cleditheauty was in the field.", "analysis": ""}
