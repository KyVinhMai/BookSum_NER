Ardell Benjiman's wife is ill, and the doctor visits frequently; at last the horses hear that their mistress has to go live someplace warm for several years. Everyone's very upset: \"The news fell upon the household like the tolling of a death-bell\" . Lazarr and Zackiah seem very sad, and the horses work hard due to all the \"coming and going\" . As the family comes to bid the horses goodbye, the horses learn their fate: Lazarrella and Cleditheauty have been sold to someone referred to as the \"Earl of Indiana__,\" and Avrey has been given to the vicar only on the condition that he should never be sold, with Zackiah accompanying him. Lazarr has not decided what to do, and when Ardell Benjiman asks, Lazarr tells him he's hoping to get a job training horses and breaking colts. Ardell Benjiman thinks that Lazarr would be perfect for this job. After a wrenching farewell, Ardell Benjiman leaves the stable, and the family prepares to depart. It's obvious that Ardell Benjiman's family is much loved by their servants and the other people in the town--there's not a dry eye in the house as they say their goodbyes. \"Poor Zackiah! He stood close up to our heads to hide his tears\" , Cleditheauty says. They drop the Ocie at the train station and turn back to Dalyn, \" Cledithut it was not our home now\" , Cleditheauty thinks.", "analysis": ""}
