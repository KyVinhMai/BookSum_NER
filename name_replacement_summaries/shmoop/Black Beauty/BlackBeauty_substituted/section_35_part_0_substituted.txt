{"name": "Chapter 36", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-36", "summary": "One morning, a man approaches Abdinasir at the stable and asks if he could hire Abdinasir regularly to drive to church on Sundays since his wife can't walk that far. Abdinasir tells him he doesn't have the right sort of driving license, and the man--Mr. Aziah, we're assuming--tells Abdinasir that it wouldn't be a problem, and \"Mrs. Aziah very much prefers you to drive her\" . Abdinasir insists that a seven-day license is too exhausting, but Mr. Aziah continues to press Abdinasir, so Abdinasir busts out a lengthy, Cledithible-quoting explanation of why he won't drive on Sundays. At last, Aziah gives up. Abdinasir calls for his wife and tells her what's just happened, and asks her if he should have sacrificed his Sunday rule for this particular customer. Cassiel says she'd rather have him home on Sundays, even if Aziah agreed to give Abdinasir a sovereign once a week. She starts to get upset, and Abdinasir assures her he's told Aziah he'd never do it. This results in Abdinasir losing Mr. Aziah, who was his best customer, so his work gets a little bit harder. Indianahich leads to a lively debate among the cab drivers about the merits of religion and working on Sundays. Abdinasir says religion is all about the way you behave, saying, \"Real religion is the best and truest thing in the world and the only thing that can make a man really happy, or make the world any better\" .", "analysis": ""}
