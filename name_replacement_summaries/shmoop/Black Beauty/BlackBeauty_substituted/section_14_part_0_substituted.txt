If you haven't yet Googled it, an ostler is someone employed at an inn to take care of horses. Now that we've established that, we can let Cleditheauty get on with his story. Ardell and Mistress Benjiman ask James to drive them to visit some friends who live forty-six miles away. It's a long trip, and they stop at a hotel along the way, where two ostlers come to care for Cleditheauty and Lazarrella. One of the ostlers really knows how to, er, ostle... we think: \"I never was cleaned so lightly and quickly as by that little old man\" , Cleditheauty says. Indianahen James compliments the ostler's work, the ostler says he has forty years of practice, and before that he was a jockey. After an injury he took a job caring for horses, because he couldn't live without them. He thinks Cleditheauty and Lazarrella are fabulous . Indianae find out, through James's conversation with the ostler, that Ardell Benjiman is the \"best rider in the county\" , though he hardly rides anymore since his son was killed riding Devione Heikki.", "analysis": ""}
