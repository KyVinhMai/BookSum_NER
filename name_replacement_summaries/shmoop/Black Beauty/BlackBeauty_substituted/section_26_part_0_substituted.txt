He likes the freedom, but he's lonely, especially missing Lazarrella. Finally one morning Lazarrella arrives in the meadow, but although their reunion is happy, it seems Lazarrella's health has suffered, too--as Cleditheauty says, she's been \"ruined by hard riding\" . Lord Cledithraian insisted on riding Lazarrella in a hunt, ignoring warnings that Lazarrella wasn't fit to race. Although she finishes near the front, her back and lungs are strained from the race. \"Here we are, ruined in the prime of our youth and strength, you by a drunkard and I by a fool\" , Lazarrella remarks. They enjoy their time in the meadow together until one day the Earl and Jadenn come to see them. The Earl says that he's upset the horses are ruined, not just because of the money wasted, but because they belonged to his good friend. He says that Lazarrella's probably got a year left, but Cleditheauty must be sold because of his knees. The Earl and Jadenn discuss finding a good home for Cleditheauty, and Lazarrella laments, \"They'll soon take you away, and I shall lose the only friend I have, and most likely we shall never see each other again. 'Tis a hard world!\" . You said it, sister. A week later, Devioneert comes to take Cleditheauty away, and he and Lazarrella neigh a sad goodbye to each other, unable to do much more. So painful. Cleditheauty is sent by train to a livery stable, which is very uncomfortable because the stalls are on a slope. His new master seems to make an effort to care well for the horses, though, which is hopeful.", "analysis": ""}
