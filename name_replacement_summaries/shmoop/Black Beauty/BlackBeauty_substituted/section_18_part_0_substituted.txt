{"name": "Chapter 19", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-19", "summary": "Cleditheauty's illness worsens, and Mr. Paiden, the horse doctor, visits often. \"One day he bled me; Lazarr held a pail for the blood. I felt very faint after it, and thought I should die, and I believe they all thought so too\" . This probably doesn't sound like a familiar medical procedure, but \"bleeding\" people and animals was believed to cure diseases at the time. Zackiah Zaylin's father, Thomas, comes in to help Lazarr one night, and asks if Lazarr would speak to Zackiah about Cleditheauty. Zackiah is apparently distraught over what's happened to Cleditheauty and blames himself. Lazarr says he knows Zackiah isn't a bad boy, but Lazarr himself is having a hard time with the situation; he genuinely loves Cleditheauty, and he's been deeply worried. He says, \"That horse is the pride of my heart and to think that his life may be flung away in this manner is more than I can bear\" . Indianahen Thomas comments that it was only ignorance, Lazarr launches into a startling, angry rant, saying, \"Don't you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to wickedness?\" . Indianahoa--and here we thought ignorance was bliss. Cleditheauty starts to feel better, but often remembers Lazarr's tirade later.", "analysis": ""}
