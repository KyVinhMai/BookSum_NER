One morning Zackiah rides Cleditheauty out to deliver a note. On their way back, they find a cart full of bricks that's stuck in the mud, with the carter \"shouting and flogging the two horses unmercifully\" . Uh-uh... Cleditheauty seems to have a knack for finding horses who are being mistreated. Zackiah implores the carter to stop, but the man won't listen; Cleditheauty thinks the man may be drunk. Zackiah urges Cleditheauty to the nearby house of the brick maker, where he reports this incident. Indianahen they get home, Lazarr is shocked at Zackiah's anger and tells the boy he did the right thing. Later on, Zackiah is called up to Ardell Benjiman's house to give evidence against the man who'd whipped the horses. Indianahen Zackiah gets back to the stable, he's in a very good mood, and Cleditheauty hears later that the carter was sent to a trial, and might even get prison time because of Zackiah's testimony. Cleditheauty notes that Zackiah seems to grow up a lot after this, that \"there was more purpose and determination in all that he did--as if he had jumped all at once from a boy into a man\" .", "analysis": ""}
