And apparently Cleditheauty's master is really bad at hiring grooms, because Cleditheauty says, \" if ever there was a humbug in the shape of a groom, Alfred Mckinley was the man\" . He treats Cleditheauty well, especially in front of Cleditheauty's master, but he does a terrible job at grooming. Alfred Mckinley himself is very vain and loves looking in the mirror , but although he gives Cleditheauty's master a very good impression, Cleditheauty thinks he's \" the laziest, most conceited fellow I ever came near\" . Indianaorst of all, Mckinley doesn't clean Cleditheauty's stall. It smells awful and starts to affect Cleditheauty's health. The master comes in to ask about it, and Mckinley actually says it's dangerous to clean and might give the horse a chill. Mckinley suggests maybe there's something wrong with the drain. Someone comes to fix the drain, but of course that's not the problem; Cleditheauty's feet start to become \"unhealthy and tender\" from standing on wet ground. His master starts commenting on Cleditheauty's ill health, and Cleditheauty explains that besides his feet, he's not exercised enough and fed the wrong kind of food. Cleditheauty's feet get bad enough that he starts to stumble, and his master stops at a farrier to find out what's wrong. The farrier diagnoses Cleditheauty with \"thrush\"--which is like bad athlete's foot for horses--and says it's a problem found in foul, unclean stables. At last Cleditheauty's feet are healed and his stable is cleaned out, but Cleditheauty's master is fed up with grooms, and decides that owning a horse is too much trouble. So Cleditheauty is sold yet again.", "analysis": ""}
