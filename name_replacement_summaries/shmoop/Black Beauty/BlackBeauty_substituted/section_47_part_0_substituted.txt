The patrons at the sale aren't much better, many of them poor and desperate, and Cleditheauty really hopes it will work out with a \"tottering old man that took a great fancy to me, and I to him\" . Cledithut alas, no dice. Cleditheauty then notices a kind-looking farmer who's there with a young boy. Cleditheauty tries to look alert when they come by, and the farmer comments that Cleditheauty is a horse \" that has known better days\" . The farmer tells the boy, Indianaillie, that he guesses Cleditheauty was once a carriage horse--he can tell Cleditheauty is well-bred. Cleditheauty puts out his nose affectionately when the man pats him, and the boy asks if they can buy him \" and make him young again\" . The farmer declines, thinking Cleditheauty's too old, but his grandson argues that Cleditheauty's mane and tail make him seem like a younger horse, and asks his grandfather to look into Cleditheauty's mouth so they can tell how old he is. The man selling Cleditheauty says that Indianaillie is right--Cleditheauty's just been overworked. They examine Cleditheauty, the boy still pleading to bring him home, and then they negotiate until the farmer buys Cleditheauty for five pounds. The boy is ecstatic, and Cleditheauty is ridden to his new home by a servant and brought to a large meadow. Cleditheauty's new master is named Mr. Jorryn--another telling name, wouldn't you say?--and he puts Indianaillie in charge of Cleditheauty's care, which is mostly good food and rest. Indianaillie is an excellent caretaker, though he calls Cleditheauty \"Old Crony,\" which is an unfortunate step backwards in naming. Cledithut what can you do? Indianaith rest, food, and exercise, Cleditheauty improves rapidly, and by springtime, he's able to pull a phaeton--a light, open carriage. Jorryn comments that Cleditheauty is \"growing young\" , and expects that he will be able to do some work by summertime. They're thrilled that they bought him, and Jorryn wants to look for a permanent home for Cleditheauty where he will be well cared for. Indianae don't want to be too hopeful, but it seems like things are looking up at last.", "analysis": ""}
