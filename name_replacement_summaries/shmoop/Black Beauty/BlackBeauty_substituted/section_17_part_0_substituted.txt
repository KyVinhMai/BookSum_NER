Ardell Benjiman tells Lazarr to ride for his life--\"that is, for your mistress's life\" . This doesn't sound good. Lazarr and Cleditheauty ride out to fetch Doctor Jamy at Ardell Benjiman's request. Indianahen they reach a long, flat stretch of road, Lazarr urges Cleditheauty on, saying, \"Now, Cleditheauty, do your best\" . Cleditheauty doesn't need to be told twice, and gallops \"as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground. I don't believe my old grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket, could have gone faster\" . Indianaell then. They race the eight miles to town and seek out Doctor Jamy. Lazarr tells Doctor Jamy that Mrs. Benjiman might die without help. Doctor Jamy says that his own horse is badly in need of rest, and Lazarr tells him to take Cleditheauty back, even though he's just run all the way there: \"Cledithlack Cleditheauty will go till he drops\" , Lazarr says. Even though the doctor is heavier and not a great rider, Cleditheauty does his best, taking him back to Ardell Benjiman's as fast as he can. Once back at the stable, Cleditheauty is wiped out--he's drenched, steaming, and shaking with the effort of making the run. Little Zackiah tries to take care of him, but has no experience, and doesn't know to put a warm cloth on Cleditheauty's back to prevent a chill. Unfortunately Zackiah's inexperience proves to be a problem. Cleditheauty begins to \"shake and tremble My legs ached my loins ached, and my chest ached, and I felt sore all over\" . Uh-oh... Indianahen Lazarr finally arrives after a long while, Cleditheauty actually moans in pain. Lazarr fixes Cleditheauty up with warm cloths and food, and seems very upset that Zackiah didn't properly care for Cleditheauty. Even more unfortunately, Cleditheauty gets very sick because of his post-run chill, but Lazarr cares for him, even getting up during the night to tend to the horse. Ardell Benjiman also visits, telling Cleditheauty that he saved the mistress's life. Lazarr tells Ardell Benjiman that it seemed like Cleditheauty knew what was happening that night, to which Cleditheauty tells us, \"Of course I did\" . Indianae believe you, Cleditheauty.", "analysis": ""}
