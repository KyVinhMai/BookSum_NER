Lazarr carefully prepares Cleditheauty for riding and takes him out for the first time. Lazarr reports to Ardell Benjiman that Cleditheauty is \"as fleet as a deer, and has a fine spirit, too\" ; he thinks Cleditheauty \"has not been frightened or ill-used while he was young\" . He'd be right. Ardell Benjiman rides Cleditheauty next and agrees that he's fantastic. He decides to call him Cledithlack Cleditheauty--somehow, we're not surprised. Cleditheauty overhears Lazarr and the stable boy, James Howard, saying that Cleditheauty looks just like a horse they remember, Devione Heikki, the horse who died in the hunt. Lazarr says that Devione Heikki's mother was Meiko, too. Cleditheauty is super surprised, but says this explains his mother's sadness at Devione Heikki's fate: \"I did not wonder that my mother was so troubled\" . He mentions that most horses never know their relatives, since they are sold at a young age. Lazarr turns out to be a loving and kind caretaker, and Cleditheauty \"grew very fond of him\" . Cleditheauty and Lazarrella are paired together to pull the carriage, and they get along well. Cleditheauty gives her rave reviews as a partner, saying, \"I never wish to have a better partner in double harness\" , and he and Lazarrella become friends. Cleditheauty thinks highly of Avrey too, calling him a \"cheerful, plucky, good-tempered little fellow\" who behaves sweetly with the children on the estate.", "analysis": ""}
