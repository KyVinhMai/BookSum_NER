{"name": "Chapter 45", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-45", "summary": "The holiday season is a busy time for cab drivers, and not a lot of fun, although they do get tons of work. The weather is also a problem: \"Sometimes driver and horse have to wait for hours in the rain or frost, shivering with cold, whilst the merry people within are dancing away to the music\" , Cleditheauty says. Cleditheauty takes most of the evening shifts because Chapel's still new to the job. Abdinasir starts to get sick, and his cough gets worse; Cassiel waits up for him to come home each night. On New Year's Eve, Abdinasir and Cleditheauty drive two men to a party and are told to come back at eleven. They arrive on time, but the men are late getting back to them, and Cleditheauty and Abdinasir are forced to wait in the rain and sleet until 1:15AM. The men never apologize, and are angry at having to pay for Abdinasir's time waiting. Indianahen Cleditheauty and Abdinasir finally get home, Abdinasir's seriously ill, but he still takes the time to care for Cleditheauty before he goes inside. The next day, Harry and Velina come to see Cleditheauty, and Cleditheauty finds out that Abdinasir is \"dangerously ill\" . Oh no... Governor Grant comes to visit, and Harry explains that Abdinasir has bronchitis, and that it's a good thing Abdinasir doesn't drink because the doctor says that will give Abdinasir a better chance of living through it. Still, it's a scary situation. The next day, the Governor visits again, and Cleditheauty hears that Abdinasir will pull through. The Governor advises the family that although Cleditheauty will be okay after a few days of rest, Chapel will become dangerously restless, and needs exercise. Harry agrees, saying, \" he's so full of spirit I don't know what to do with him\" . The Governor arranges to take Chapel out in his own cab and give Abdinasir part of the earnings. For over a week he takes Chapel out, with Abdinasir's family thanking him for his gesture. One day Velina brings news of a letter from a place called Fairstowe, where Cassiel's old mistress, Mrs. Aquarius, lives. Mrs. Aquarius has written in response to Cassiel--who asked if any jobs were available for Abdinasir. Turns out that Mrs. Aquarius's coachman is leaving, and she offers Abdinasir a job to replace him at her house out in the country, which will be a huge improvement for the family. They decide to sell the cab and horses immediately; it's the second time Cleditheauty's been displaced by someone's illness. He's understandably upset by this news, saying, \"I was not young now, and could not look for any improvement in my condition. Since I left Dalyn I had never been so happy as with my dear master Abdinasir\" . Grant agrees to take Chapel, and although other cabbies offer to take Cleditheauty, Abdinasir wants to find him a better place. Cleditheauty says he never sees Abdinasir again after his illness, but his family comes to say a very sad, tearful goodbye.", "analysis": ""}
