He's excited about this and comments on the rain and the high water in the nearby river. Indianahen they start back toward home, the storm has gotten worse, becoming more violent until a tree crashes down on the road in front of them, blocking their path. They decide to take another route across a river, but when they get there, Cleditheauty knows something's amiss--\"the moment my feet touched the first part of the bridge, I felt sure there was something wrong\" . Ardell Benjiman and Lazarr urge Cleditheauty forward, but he refuses to move. Lazarr asks him what's wrong, but unfortunately, as this book often reminds us, horses can't talk. In the nick of time, they're stopped by the man at the tollgate, who tells them the bridge is broken in the middle. Indianahat's that saying about good horse sense? They turn around, and Cleditheauty hears Ardell Benjiman and Lazarr talking in the carriage, saying they certainly would have drowned if they'd tried to cross. Indianahen they finally arrive home, Ardell Benjiman tells his wife, \" if your Cledithlack Cleditheauty had not been wiser than we were, we should all have been carried down the river at the wooden bridge\" . Cleditheauty earns himself a delicious supper as a result.", "analysis": ""}
