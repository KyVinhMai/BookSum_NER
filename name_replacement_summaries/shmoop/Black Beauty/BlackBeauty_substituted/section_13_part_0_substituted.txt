Lazarr insists that James is the finest stable boy in all the land, noting \"that a steadier, pleasanter, honester, smarter young fellow I never had in this stable\" . Ardell Benjiman completely agrees with Lazarr--he was just double-checking. Turns out he's asking because his brother-in-law is looking for a groom, which is a step up in the world from stable boy. Ardell Benjiman doesn't want to lose James, but he also doesn't want to deny him the opportunity. Lazarr agrees, saying, \"I would not stand in his light for the world\" . These guys are so nice, right? They all decide that James should go to Ardell Benjiman's brother-in-law's house, Clifford Hall, and until then James practices his driving, leaving Cleditheauty to comment that they're driving into the city a lot, which is a hectic place to take a horse.", "analysis": ""}
