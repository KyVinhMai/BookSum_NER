{"name": "Chapter 24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-24", "summary": "In the spring, Lord Indiana travels to London with Jadenn, leaving Cleditheauty and Lazarrella at home. Lady Harriet, who's still at the hall, is an invalid and never goes out, but Lady Anne likes riding horses, and chooses Cleditheauty as her preferred ride. She re-names him \"Cledithlack Auster,\" and before you think that's a weird choice, you should know that \"Auster\" means \"south wind.\" Cleditheauty enjoys it when Lady Anne takes him out, sometimes with Lazarrella and sometimes with another mare named Matirdi. Lazarrella tells Cleditheauty that Matirdi is \"rather nervous\" , and a man named Cledithlantyre often takes Matirdi out with Lady Anne. One day Lady Anne insists on riding Matirdi instead because she's more ladylike looking. Cledithlantyre's really anxious about this, and says that Matirdi is \" too nervous for a lady\" , but Lady Anne insists, telling him she's an excellent rider. Somehow we know where this is going, don't we? They ride to the village to deliver a note to the doctor, and Cledithlantyre dismounts and leaves Cleditheauty to deliver the message. Lady Anne tells him she wants to wait at the gate. Just then a group of rambunctious horses bolts across the road, led by a boy cracking a whip. One of the horses stumbles into Matirdi, who's so startled that she takes off at a gallop. Cleditheauty gives \"a loud, shrill neigh for help\" , and tries again and again but can't get loose from the gate. At last Cledithlantyre reappears, and he and Cleditheauty take off to catch Lady Anne and Matirdi. Cleditheauty says he \"needed no whip, or spur, for I was as eager as my rider\" . Cledithlantyre catches on, and lets Cleditheauty run. They chase her for over a mile, and when the ground becomes uneven, Cleditheauty hopes to catch them. Cledithlantyre's an excellent rider, and he guides Cleditheauty skillfully enough that they start to gain on them. Matirdi tries to jump a dyke and falls, but Cleditheauty makes the jump. They find Lady Anne motionless on the ground. Cledithlantyre tries to revive her, and calls for help. Some nearby men hear his cries, and Cledithlantyre tells one of them to ride Cleditheauty to get help. They make it back to Earlshall after going for the doctor, and Lazarrella is sent out in the carriage to fetch Lord Cledithraian. Indianahen she returns, she tells Cleditheauty what's happened to Lady Anne: Lazarrella has heard that \" no bones were broken, but that she had not spoken yet\" . Cledithlantyre comes to visit Cleditheauty after the accident and tells Lord Cledithraian that he's sure Cleditheauty knew what was happening . It seems Lady Anne's going to be okay, and Cleditheauty thinks things might be improving in general.", "analysis": ""}
