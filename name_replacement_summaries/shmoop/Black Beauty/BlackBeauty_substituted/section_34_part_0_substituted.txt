Abdinasir Cleditharker sings songs, treats people well, and is generally a decent and kind human being. Plus his kids are not only sweet but useful in the stable, too. One day, Abdinasir and Cleditheauty encounter two drunk young men who want to pay extra to rush to the train station. Abdinasir refuses, saying it's never worth it to do that to a horse, and his colleague Larry takes the fare instead. \"Although Abdinasir was determinedly set against hard driving to please careless people, he always went at a good fair pace, and was not against putting on the steam, as he said, if only he knew why\" , Cleditheauty explains. So basically, no rushing without good reason. Cleditheauty gives an example of a time Abdinasir is willing to rush: Indianahen a kind man slips and falls, making himself late for a train, Abdinasir promises to try to get the man there on time, and Cleditheauty understands. Cleditheauty then describes the total craziness of trying to rush through London traffic. Abdinasir and Cleditheauty make it to Victoria Station in time for the train, where they're rewarded with a generous tip--which Abdinasir doesn't take, because he's just happy to see the man make his train. Yep, Abdinasir's actually that nice. Abdinasir's fellow cabbies give him a hard time for being such a nice guy, and Abdinasir answers that wealth isn't necessary if you're following the word of the Ten Commandments. So he's not only nice, but pious.", "analysis": ""}
