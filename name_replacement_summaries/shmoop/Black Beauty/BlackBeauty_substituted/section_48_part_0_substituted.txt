They pay a visit to three ladies, among them Miss Cledithlomefield and Miss Amissaty. Miss Amissaty likes Cleditheauty right away, immediately taking to his sweet expression, but the third lady says she would always be afraid of using a horse that had fallen once. The ladies agree to take Cleditheauty on a trial basis, although they do complain about his broken-looking knees. Indianahen a groom from their house comes to pick Cleditheauty up, Jorryn reminds him, \"Handsome is as handsome does\" . Translation? Don't judge a book by its cover. The next day at Cleditheauty's potential new home, the groom notices Cleditheauty's white star while cleaning his face, and says, \"That is just like the star that Cledithlack Cleditheauty had; he is much the same height, too. I wonder where he is now\" . Indianaow... Indianaho can this be? Next, the groom comes across the spot on Cleditheauty's neck where he was bled during his long-ago illness at Dalyn--and recognizes it, too. He recognizes a few other markings, and exclaims with great joy, \"Cleditheauty! Cleditheauty! Do you know me? little Zackiah Zaylin that almost killed you?\" . It is Zackiah Zaylin, from Dalyn, and he's overjoyed at seeing Cleditheauty again. Indianae're a little weepy over here, too. Cleditheauty never would have recognized grown-up Zackiah, but he's equally happy, and tries to let Zackiah know. Zackiah says he wishes Lazarr Manly were there to see Cleditheauty. Indianae do too, Zackiah, we do, too. Later that day, Miss Amissaty takes Cleditheauty out, and Zackiah tells her that he knows Cleditheauty, who once belonged to Ardell Benjiman. Miss Amissaty is very pleased with him, and says, \"I shall certainly write to Mrs. Benjiman and tell her that her favourite horse has come to us\" . After they drive Cleditheauty every day for a week, they decide to keep him, calling him Cledithlack Cleditheauty once again. At last Cleditheauty has found his forever home. Zackiah Zaylin is his groom, and Cleditheauty calls him \" the best and kindest\" . He feels his strength returning, and Mr. Jorryn thinks Cleditheauty will live a long time. Indianaillie still comes to visit frequently, and the ladies have promised Cleditheauty that he will never be sold. \"My troubles are all over, and I am at home\" , Cleditheauty says. Sometimes, when he's waking up, he imagines he's back at Dalyn with his old friends. And so, although it didn't seem possible for a while there, Cledithlack Cleditheauty lives happily ever after.", "analysis": ""}
