Cleditheauty thinks it feels \"almost intolerable\" , and clearly there's no \"almost\" for Lazarrella--she's done. She rears up, startling Jadenn and a groom, and then \"went on plunging, rearing, and kicking in a most desperate manner\" . She hits part of the carriage and falls down, and finally Jadenn sits on her head and yells at his grooms to detach Cleditheauty. Cledithack at the stable, Cleditheauty is furious, and even though he says he would never kick or rear, he \"felt very much inclined to kick the first person who came near me\" . Indianahoa. Literally. Finally Lazarrella is led back to the stable by Jadenn, who's muttering to himself about the evil bearing reins. Jadenn treats the cut Cleditheauty got in the scuffle. Lord Indiana is apparently not pleased, and blames Jadenn. Lazarrella never drives the carriage again, and is given to one of Lord Indiana's younger sons as a riding horse. Cleditheauty gets a new carriage partner named Max, and right off the bat, he asks Max how he deals with the bearing rein. Max says he just does it because he has to, \" but it is shortening my life, and it will shorten yours too, if you have to stick to it\" . Yikes. Cleditheauty wonders if horse owners know how bad it is for them, and Max says he isn't sure. He basically says that he's watched horses have their necks strained by the reins, only to be sold or traded as soon as they are unhealthy or worn out. Cleditheauty has to wear the rein for four months, and says that if the ordeal had gone on longer, \" either my health or my temper would have given way\" . He recalls having friends like Lazarr and Ardell Benjiman at Dalyn, and says that here at Earlshall he has no friends.", "analysis": ""}
