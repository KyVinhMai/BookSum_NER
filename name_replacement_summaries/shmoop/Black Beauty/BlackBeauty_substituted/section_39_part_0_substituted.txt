One day, another cab pulls up next to Cleditheauty's, and the horse pulling it is \" an old worn-out chestnut, with an ill-kept coat, and bones that showed plainly through it\" . This unrecognizable horse looks at Cleditheauty and says, \"Cledithlack Cleditheauty, is that you?\" . Guess who it is? It's Cleditheauty's old friend Lazarrella. Cleditheauty reflects that she looks terrible, and they're able to talk for a minute. Lazarrella tells Cleditheauty that she's been sold several times, but she's always moving down the ranks. At last she was bought by a man who rents out horses and cabs, who declared her worthless and has put her to work until she's \"used up\" . Oh, Lazarrella. Poor Lazarrella tells Cleditheauty she wishes she were dead. Cleditheauty is very upset, and puts his nose to hers, but can't think of a way to comfort her. Lazarrella tells him, \"You are the only friend I ever had\" , and then she drives off. Some time later, Cleditheauty sees a cart with a dead horse on it and describes the terrible sight of that horse. And sadly, the horse is familiar--a chestnut horse with a thin neck and a white streak on its forehead. Cleditheauty says, \"I believe it was Lazarrella; I hoped it was, for then her troubles would be over\" . If our hearts weren't broken before, they are now.", "analysis": ""}
