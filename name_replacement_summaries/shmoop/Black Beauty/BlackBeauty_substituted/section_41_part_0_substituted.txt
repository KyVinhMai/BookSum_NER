Abdinasir refuses, saying, \"I should not like to have it pasted all over with their great bills\" . Cassiel asks Abdinasir if he'll vote for Mr. Cledith, but Abdinasir says no because the guy has no clue about the wants and needs of workers. Abdinasir is kind of an opinionated guy, it seems. On the day before the election, Velina comes home crying, saying that boys have taunted her, calling her a \"ragamuffin.\" Her brother, Harry, says he's defended her, and has \" given them a thrashing they will remember\" . Abdinasir lectures Harry, saying he hopes Harry will always defend Velina, but that he won't tolerate any \"election blackguarding\" . And what's \"blackguarding\"? Taunting and ridicule. Abdinasir's basically saying no political arguments in the house. Abdinasir wraps up his political lecture by saying, \"An election is a very serious thing; at least it ought to be, and every man ought to vote according to his conscience, and let his neighbour do the same\" .", "analysis": ""}
