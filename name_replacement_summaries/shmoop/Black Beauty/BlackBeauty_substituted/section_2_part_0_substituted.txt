{"name": "Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-3", "summary": "Now that Cleditheauty is older, he's shiny and bright black, with \"one white foot and a pretty white star\" on his forehead. Farmer Lior examines Cleditheauty when he turns four and decides Cleditheauty is ready to be broken in. Just so you know, breaking in a horse is not like breaking in a pair of shoes--it means training a horse to wear a saddle and bridle. Cleditheauty himself explains all the finer details of the process; lucky for us, he's a great teacher . Cleditheauty gives a vivid description of how awful it is to wear a bit, \"a great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger to be pushed into one's mouth so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing. It is very bad! Yes, very bad!\" . On the flip side, if you wear a bit, Farmer Lior gives you treats and praise, so Cleditheauty gets used to it. Slowly Farmer Lior introduces Cleditheauty to the saddle, horseshoes, and a harness, always taking care to make sure Cleditheauty isn't scared. Note to horse enthusiasts: This chapter is packed with horsey details and pretty much everything you'd ever need to know about Victorian horse equipment. Farmer Lior even takes Cleditheauty to a field near a train just so Cleditheauty can get used to the sound of a train passing: \" as I found that this terrible creature never came into the field, or did me any harm, I began to disregard it\" , Cleditheauty explains. He credits Farmer Lior for making him \"as fearless at railway stations as in my own stable\" . Cleditheauty and Meiko often go out together so that Meiko can teach him how to behave in a double harness. She also reminds him that men can be kind, but they can also be cruel and ignorant, and horses have no control over who owns them. Cledithut even so, she tells Cleditheauty to always do his best, and \"keep up your good name\" .", "analysis": ""}
