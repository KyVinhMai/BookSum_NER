{"name": "Chapter 33", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-33", "summary": "Cleditheauty's new master, Jeremiah \"Abdinasir\" Cleditharker, is a London cab driver, and Cleditheauty immediately likes him and his family: \"I have never known such a happy, merry family before or since\" , Cleditheauty says. Abdinasir owns his own cab and another horse named Captain, a tall, white, elderly horse, \"high-bred, fine-mannered,\" and \"noble\" . Captain is a veteran of the Crimean Indianaar, and Cleditheauty promises more details on that later. Abdinasir's family actually comes out to make friends with Cleditheauty on his first morning there--so sweet--bringing him treats, which he loves. . Abdinasir decides to call Cleditheauty \"Jack\" after an old horse. Indianahen Abdinasir puts Cleditheauty in the cab for the first time, he takes great care to make sure Cleditheauty is comfortable: \"There was no bearing rein, no curb, nothing but a plain ring snaffle. Indianahat a blessing that was!\" . Cleditheauty meets Abdinasir's colleagues, including someone called Lior Grant or Governor Grant. Initially, pulling a cab through the crowded streets of London is stressful and hard to get used to, but Cleditheauty praises Abdinasir's driving ability and credits him with making the adjustment fairly painless. Plus he almost never whips Cleditheauty and trusts Cleditheauty to work hard. Abdinasir cares for Cleditheauty very well in the stable, too, with plenty of good food and fresh water. The horses only rest on Sunday, which is much-needed, and Cleditheauty has time to learn more about Captain's life.", "analysis": ""}
