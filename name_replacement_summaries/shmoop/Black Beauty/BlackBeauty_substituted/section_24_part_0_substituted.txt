{"name": "Chapter 25", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-25", "summary": "The man left in charge of the stables when Jadenn goes to London is named Yaniv Freddi, and Cleditheauty thinks he's fantastic... as long as he isn't drinking, that is. He doesn't drink often, but apparently when he does, it's a total disaster. Jadenn almost gets rid of him because of this vice, but Freddi is so valuable and talented with horses that he gets another chance. Cleditheauty is chosen to make a journey with Freddi to return Colonel Cledithlantyre to his regiment in town. On the way back, Freddi stops at an inn with Cleditheauty, where the ostler notices that Cleditheauty has a loose nail in his shoe. Freddi says it'll be fine, and Cleditheauty thinks this is kind of unusual, since he's usually so careful. Freddi gets angry with the ostler--even more unusual--and takes off with Cleditheauty, whipping him unnecessarily. There's definitely something wrong with Cleditheauty's shoe, and finally it comes off as they're running at top speed, which is super not good. Making things worse, Freddi's too drunk to notice that something's wrong with our main stallion. They turn onto a road covered in fresh stones, and Cleditheauty is forced to run full speed ahead while missing a shoe. He breaks his hoof, splitting it to the quick and cutting the inside badly. He stumbles from the pain and falls badly on his knees, accidentally throwing Freddi. Cleditheauty limps to the side of the road, but Freddi doesn't move. No one comes, and Cleditheauty stands and waits in agonizing pain. It's a lovely night, and Cleditheauty can't help thinking of summer nights spent lying next to his mother. At a moment like this, anyone would miss their mom.", "analysis": ""}
