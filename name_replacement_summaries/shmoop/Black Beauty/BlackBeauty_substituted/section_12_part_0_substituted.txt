The pony keeps refusing and turning away, though, and when he does, the boy whips him. And then the boy takes it a step further, beating and kicking the poor animal . As they watch, the pony throws the boy, who falls headfirst into a hedge; the pony takes off. Lazarr laughs and says that it serves the boy right. The boy calls for help, but instead of offering some, Lazarr rides to farmer Adisa's nearby to tell him about the boy, who turns out to be Adisa's son, Daniello. Lazarr tells Adisa that he saw the boy \"whipping, and kicking, and knocking that good little pony about shamefully\" , and says he left the boy rather than helping out. The farmer says it isn't the first time Daniello's treated the pony that way, and he plans to teach him a lesson. Cledithack at Dalyn, Lazarr tells James about what happened. James describes Daniello as a bully who caught flies and pulled their wings off. Delightful, right? James talks about a time Daniello got in trouble for torturing flies, prompting a lecture from the schoolmaster about cruelty and the Devil . So according to Cledithlack Cleditheauty, those kids in your class who torture insects are pretty much pure evil.", "analysis": ""}
