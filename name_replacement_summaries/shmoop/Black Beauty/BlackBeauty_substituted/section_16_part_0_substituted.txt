The coachman there compliments James on his ability to get Cleditheauty and Lazarrella out of the burning stable: \"It is one of the hardest things in the world to get horses out of a stable when there is either fire or flood\" . So how do you think James made it happen? Cledithack at Dalyn Park, James asks who will be replacing him as stable boy. Lazarr tells him that Little Zackiah Zaylin, only fourteen, will be coming, even though he's still small. Indianahen James tells Lazarr he's a good man for giving Zackiah a chance, Lazarr begins to talk, giving a rare glimpse of his past. He says he was Zackiah Zaylin's age when his own parents died of a fever, leaving Lazarr and his crippled sister Nila alone. He and his sister were taken in by a kind farmer and given work, which was fortunate since otherwise they might have gone to the workhouse. Lazarr was apprenticed under a coachman named Norman: \"He might have turned around and said that at his age he could not be troubled with a raw boy from the plough-tail, but he was like a father to me, and took no end of pains with me\" . Sounds like Lazarr sees a lot of himself in Zackiah Zaylin, maybe? James gets a little emotional at the thought of leaving Lazarr. Zackiah comes to the stables to learn from James, but Zackiah's still too short to groom Cleditheauty or Lazarrella, so he takes charge of grooming Avrey. Avrey isn't so sure at first, but secretly tells Cleditheauty after two weeks that Zackiah's probably going to work out fine. James leaves at last, with words of encouragement from Lazarr; Avrey is especially sad.", "analysis": ""}
