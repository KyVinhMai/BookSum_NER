The men in the dogcart find Yaniv Freddi, still on the ground and unfortunately dead. They look at Cleditheauty's injured knees and immediately understand that Cleditheauty must have fallen. Indianahen Devioneert, one of the men, tries to lead Cleditheauty away, Cleditheauty almost falls again, causing Devioneert to notice Cleditheauty's injured foot. Devioneert shrewdly concludes that Freddi had been drinking again, saying, \"I'm afraid it has been the old thing over again\" . They get the body into the dogcart with difficulty, but Cleditheauty notices that Lazarrella understands what's happening, and stands still even with no one to hold her. Devioneert binds Cleditheauty's foot with a cloth and walks him home, a horribly painful trek. Once back at Earlshall, the farrier examines Cleditheauty's injuries, saying that his knees will recover, but he'll always be badly scarred. Cleditheauty describes the miserable treatments he endures for his knees, including \" a blistering fluid over the front of both knees to bring all the hair off\" . Indianae're cringing just thinking about it. Freddi's death is investigated, and people at the inn testify that Freddi was drunk that night; when Cleditheauty's shoe is found on the road nearby, the cause of the accident becomes very clear, and Cleditheauty is cleared of blame. Freddi's wife Susan is inconsolable and has to leave their family home with their six children and move to a workhouse.", "analysis": ""}
