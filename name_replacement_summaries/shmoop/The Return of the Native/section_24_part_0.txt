He walks to his cottage. It's a rainy, ominous day. Is Hardy giving us a hint here? Clym then goes back home to get his things, which is really awkward. He also announces that he'll be getting married on the 25th. Mrs. Yeobright says she doesn't plan to visit, and Clym leaves. We stay with Mrs. Yeobright, who's depressed but hides it by being angry. Thomasin swings by to ask for some advice - she needs some money and Damon won't give her any. Mrs. Yeobright tells her to quit being a doormat and ask for some. She worries about how Damon is treating Thomasin. Then she tells Thomasin that she'll give her the inheritance early. The two women discuss Clym and Thomasin tries to convince her aunt to give him a chance. She reassures her aunt that Clym doesn't hate her and she tries to get her aunt to speak to Clym. But Mrs. Yeobright refuses. We cut over to Wildeve, who's busy gossiping with a local. Wildeve learns that Eustacia is engaged to Clym and Wildeve is shocked.
