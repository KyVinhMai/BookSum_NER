Basically Wildeve is kind of a playboy and Mrs. Yeobright therefore does not approve of him. Suddenly the reddleman comes up the road. He tells Mrs. Yeobright that he has Thomasin in his van. She came up to him crying earlier that day and said she needed a ride home. The reddleman's name is Diggory Venn, and he used to be pals with Thomasin. Mrs. Yeobright is very concerned and she goes to wake Thomasin. Thomasin is very upset but she manages to pull herself together enough to get out of Venn's van and send him on his way. Her aunt demands to know what the heck is going on. Thomasin is so grounded.", "analysis": ""}
