He confronts his wife over dinner one night and asks if she idealized him and saw him as some sort of hero and not a real person. They argue some more and Clym tells Eustacia that she can go her own way if she needs to and that he loves her anyway. Eustacia cries but then shakes herself out of her funk and decides to go to a party. So she heads out to the village where there's an outdoor festival with dancing. Damon is there too. This spells trouble. The two talk and dance all evening and sparks start flying once again. After the dance, Damon walks Eustacia home and the two talk about their marriages.

Thomasin informs him that Damon isn't home and Diggory grills her for more info. After Damon arrives home he learns that Diggory was there asking for him. Damon is a bit concerned.", "analysis": ""}
