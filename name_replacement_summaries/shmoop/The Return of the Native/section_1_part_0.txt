An old man is walking along a road. Another fellow appears on the scene - it's a guy walking alongside a van and surrounded by a cloud a red dust, like Pig-Pen. This guy is a \"reddleman,\" which is a person who sold red dye to people. Since he works with red dye all the time, the reddleman is stained red and is often socially ostracized because of that. The men walk along the road. Yes, nature is described some more. Finally, the two guys strike up a conversation. There's a girl in the reddleman's van. The reddleman is not her husband, and he's just helping her out of a jam. He refuses to elaborate more than that. The old man, a retired naval officer, is nosey, but doesn't learn any juicy gossip. The old man leaves for his house and we follow the reddleman. The heath used to be a hangout for ancient Celts and there's some cool ruins and a creepy, prehistoric vibe floating around the place. The reddleman sees a mysterious figure on a hill, but it promptly disappears.", "analysis": ""}
