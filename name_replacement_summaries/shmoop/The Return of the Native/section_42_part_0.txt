But Thomasin arrives with her baby instead and has bad news - her husband has gone out and she's afraid that he's going to run off with Eustacia. Clym says he'll go after Eustacia and tells Thomasin to just stay put with the baby since the rain is getting worse. Before Clym can leave, Captain Vye arrives. He's looking for Eustacia too and is very worried. Captain Vye's paternal instincts finally kick in and he lets Clym have it for his bad behavior. He also tells Clym that Eustacia was feeling suicidal recently and Clym flips out. Captain Vye goes home to wait for Eustacia while Clym goes out to search for her. But Thomasin starts feeling too anxious after they leave and she bundles her baby up again and goes out in the storm to find her husband. Thomasin comes upon Diggory Venn and fills him in on the manhunt action. Diggory asks if she was wandering around earlier, crying, and Thomasin says no. Diggory can't figure out who it was and agrees to help Thomasin and her baby get home safely. Suddenly, Diggory and Thomasin see something awful up ahead. Cliffhanger!", "analysis": ""}
