Eustacia and Clym are in the honeymoon phase of their marriage and spend their days frolicking about the heath and gazing at one another. But not everything is all sunshine and roses - Eustacia is getting increasingly antsy and wants to move to Paris, while Clym is getting anxious about starting his school. Meanwhile, Thomasin was surprised by how much money her aunt had given her and wrote her a thank you note. Christian is terrified and can't even speak to Mrs. Yeobright anymore. So Mrs. Yeobright gets increasingly suspicious about things, especially when she never gets a thank you note from Clym. Mrs. Yeobright then decides to go see Eustacia and find out whether or not they got the money or not. Christian finds out about her plan and confesses that he lost the money to Wildeve. Mrs. Yeobright is furious and fires him. Mrs. Yeobright convinces herself that Damon gave the money to Eustacia. So she confronts her daughter-in-law and Eustacia is insulted by the insinuation that she's a prostitute or something. The two have a huge argument and part on very bad terms. Mrs. Yeobright warns Eustacia that she'll lose Clym's love if she shows him her temper.", "analysis": ""}
