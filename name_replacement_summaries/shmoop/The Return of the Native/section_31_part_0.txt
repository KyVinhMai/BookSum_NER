Mrs. Yeobright sets out in the heat to visit her son and her daughter-in-law. She's hot and exhausted and the walk is very long. She comes across a fellow furze-cutter who directs her to Clym's house. Mrs. Yeobright follows a familiar-looking figure and is stunned to discover that it's her son and that he is a furze-cutter. She sits down for a bit to think things over. We get lots of descriptions of the hot day and the heath, which makes us want some lemonade. Mrs. Yeobright continues to watch the house and think deep thoughts.", "analysis": ""}
