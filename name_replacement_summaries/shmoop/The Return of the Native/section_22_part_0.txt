And to meet Eustacia, of course. The two of them make out for a bit and talk about their true love. Eustacia is worried about Mrs. Yeobright not liking her, and Clym tries to reassure her. Then Eustacia starts asking Clym about Paris. Clym sounds bored by this line of conversation; it seems that Eustacia never shuts up about Paris. The two discuss their marriage plans at length and Eustacia agrees to marry Clym right away if he'll promise to bring her back to Paris. Clym isn't enthused by this idea, and Eustacia says she doesn't care if he goes to Paris, she'll marry him anyway. It's like these two are having two separate conversations, but they somehow manage to finalize their engagement. After Eustacia leaves, Clym starts to worry that they're rushing into marriage and that she only loves him because of his ties to Paris. He also worries about his strained relationship with his mother.", "analysis": ""}
