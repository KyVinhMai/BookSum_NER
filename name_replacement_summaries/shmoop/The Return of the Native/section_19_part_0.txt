In a nutshell, Clym is handsome and looks like he belongs to the future. Clym was the local golden boy of whom great things were expected. He went to Paris and was successful, but now he's returned home and doesn't plan to leave. The Egdon residents are confused and concerned about their golden boy. Clym comes upon a group of them getting their weekly haircut from the local amateur barber. Maybe Clym plans to open up a salon? Nope, he plans to open up a school. The townsfolk are less-than-impressed with his crazy ideas and think he should go back to Paris.", "analysis": ""}
