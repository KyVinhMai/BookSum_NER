Clym takes to wandering around the heath, visiting the graves of his wife and mother, and being depressed. Time passes and Diggory Venn shows back up - but he's no longer red. He gave up being a reddleman and is back to running his dairy farm. Thomasin is kind of impressed. A local festival happens and Thomasin attends, hoping to see Diggory. Clym starts to get worried that Thomasin is falling for the guy again and thinks he may need to marry her instead. Diggory spent the May Day party dancing with others. Crafty, Diggory, crafty. Thomasin sees him later that evening and invites him to visit Clym, but Diggory refuses. Diggory explains he was hanging around trying to find a girl's lost glove, which Thomasin thinks is just silly. She leaves and Diggory moons over the glove some more.", "analysis": ""}
