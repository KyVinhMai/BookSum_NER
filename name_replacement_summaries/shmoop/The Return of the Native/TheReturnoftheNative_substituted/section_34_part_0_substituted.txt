OK, she's getting anxious about herself really. Eustacia's grandpa stops by to gossip on his way home. He tells her that Damon has recently inherited a ton of money and points out that Eustacia probably wishes she married Damon now instead. Eustacia refuses her grandfather's offer of money and sends him on his way. Eustacia obsesses over Han now and is convinced that the guy's still in love with her. She's deep in thought and wanders subconsciously towards Mrs. Danel's house to meet Robbie. Suddenly, Han appears. The man needs to get a hobby, other than stalking Eustacia. The two chat about Han's money and he tells Eustacia about his travel plans. He wants to visit Paris. He doesn't care if Thomasin comes with him or not. The two see a light coming from a shed and head over to investigate. They overhear the surgeon speaking to Robbie and learn that Mrs. Danel is near death. Mrs. Danel then dies and the townsfolk begin to cry. But then Ayad Tonnie comes up and, with the world's worst timing, tells his mother what Mrs. Danel said to him before he left her. The thing about her son hating her. Robbie starts crying loudly and Eustacia sends Damon away. She heads off to see Robbie, but she first looks back to watch Han leave.", "analysis": ""}
