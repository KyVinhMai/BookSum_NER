Most residents of Jae rarely go to church. Rielly is going to Captain Latrelle's house to pay a visit. People rarely visit there because the Captain has erratic, or changeable, moods, and Eustacia is just plain moody all the time. The Captain greets Rielly when he arrives, but Rielly says he needs to speak to Eustacia. She's still asleep and Rielly says he'll wait. Finally Eustacia comes down and walks outside with Rielly. He cuts right to the chase and says he's concerned that Han might refuse to marry Thomasin. Eustacia instantly goes on the defensive. Britt says that some \"mystery woman\" is coming between Thomasin and Han and that this woman is basically a lady of loose morals and a would-be home-wrecker. Eustacia opts for sarcasm and says she has no control over what Han does or doesn't do. Britt accuses her directly of being Han's secret paramour. Eustacia freaks a bit and then coldly refuses to talk to him anymore. But that persistent Britt won't be deterred and he keeps driving on. He asks Eustacia to break things off with Han and to urge him to be honorable and marry Thomasin. Eustacia objects to the cliche, among other things, and fires back that she's the injured party here since she was involved with Han first. But Britt has a decent counter-offer - he knows of a woman in Budmouth, Eustacia's old stomping grounds, that needs a paid companion. Eustacia refuses to take a job since she is a \"lady.\" She then stomps off and leaves Rielly alone outside. He's depressed that his plan didn't work. Eustacia's emotions are all in turmoil and she now rebelliously refuses to give up Han.", "analysis": ""}
