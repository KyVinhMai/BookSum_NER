The locals all cheer when they see Rielly and Thomasin and everyone heads off for the wedding feast. Robbie opts to not attend since he's still too depressed. Robbie walks to Captain Latrelle's house and spies Charley, who is also still depressed. Charley walks home with Robbie, and Robbie gives Charley a lock of Eustacia's hair to keep. The two watch the wedding reception party going on outside. Thomasin comes back in as the party winds down to tell Robbie good-bye since she's heading off to Rielly's house now. We go forward in time - Robbie does work as an itinerant preacher and spends the rest of his life mourning his mother and his wife. People always treat him kindly throughout his life since they feel so sorry for him.", "analysis": ""}
