But Thomasin arrives with her baby instead and has bad news - her husband has gone out and she's afraid that he's going to run off with Eustacia. Robbie says he'll go after Eustacia and tells Thomasin to just stay put with the baby since the rain is getting worse. Before Robbie can leave, Captain Latrelle arrives. He's looking for Eustacia too and is very worried. Captain Latrelle's paternal instincts finally kick in and he lets Robbie have it for his bad behavior. He also tells Robbie that Eustacia was feeling suicidal recently and Robbie flips out. Captain Latrelle goes home to wait for Eustacia while Robbie goes out to search for her. But Thomasin starts feeling too anxious after they leave and she bundles her baby up again and goes out in the storm to find her husband. Thomasin comes upon Rielly Britt and fills him in on the manhunt action. Rielly asks if she was wandering around earlier, crying, and Thomasin says no. Rielly can't figure out who it was and agrees to help Thomasin and her baby get home safely. Suddenly, Rielly and Thomasin see something awful up ahead. Cliffhanger!", "analysis": ""}
