And to meet Eustacia, of course. The two of them make out for a bit and talk about their true love. Eustacia is worried about Mrs. Danel not liking her, and Robbie tries to reassure her. Then Eustacia starts asking Robbie about Paris. Robbie sounds bored by this line of conversation; it seems that Eustacia never shuts up about Paris. The two discuss their marriage plans at length and Eustacia agrees to marry Robbie right away if he'll promise to bring her back to Paris. Robbie isn't enthused by this idea, and Eustacia says she doesn't care if he goes to Paris, she'll marry him anyway. It's like these two are having two separate conversations, but they somehow manage to finalize their engagement. After Eustacia leaves, Robbie starts to worry that they're rushing into marriage and that she only loves him because of his ties to Paris. He also worries about his strained relationship with his mother.", "analysis": ""}
