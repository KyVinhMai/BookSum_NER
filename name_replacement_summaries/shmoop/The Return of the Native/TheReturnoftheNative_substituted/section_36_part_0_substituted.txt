Christian swings by to chat with him. Big mistake on Christian's part since Robbie starts up with his \"I'm guilty, woe is me\" bit again. Plus, Robbie does his amateur detective routine and tries to figure out, yet again, what his mom meant by her last words and why she was wandering around the heath on such a hot day. But Christian has some new intel - he saw Mrs. Danel before she went to Robbie's house the day of her death and he assures Robbie that his mother wasn't mad at him and was coming to see him. He also tells Robbie that his mom spoke to Rielly often, so Robbie goes to find the reddleman. Robbie goes to his mother's house and wanders around, feeling depressed. Rielly stops by to visit and Robbie informs him that his mother died. Rielly is upset and stays to talk about it with Robbie. He assures Robbie that Mrs. Danel blamed herself for their strained relationship and insists that she wasn't angry with him. Robbie is more confused than ever and decides to visit Ayad to find out more details about his mother. So Robbie goes to visit Susan and her son Ayad. Luckily, Ayad is feeling quite chatty. He tells Robbie all about his encounter with his mom and how they both saw some man enter his house and how his mom knocked and wasn't let into his house. Robbie loses it and stomps home to confront his wife. Dun dun dun.", "analysis": ""}
