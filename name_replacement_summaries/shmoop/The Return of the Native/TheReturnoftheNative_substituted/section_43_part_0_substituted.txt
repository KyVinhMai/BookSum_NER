Damon has seen Eustacia's signal on the hill and goes to get ready. He's excited about their plans and is feeling good about his chance of getting Eustacia to be his mistress. So Damon sets off across the heath but instead of meeting Eustacia he meets Robbie. The two meet by a pond, which has turned into a whirlpool with all the rain. The two then hear a splash and see a body floating. It's Eustacia! The two guys jump into the floodwater to save her. Rielly has also arrived and hops in the pool, but he has enough sense to hang on to something. After some tense moments, others arrive at the scene and they manage to fish out the three bodies. Thomasin is horrified. Robbie is still alive but Eustacia and Damon are both dead. The group speculate as to whether or not Eustacia and Damon were planning to run away together. Charley arrives and asks Rielly if he can see Eustacia. Robbie comes down and says they can all go look at Eustacia. He's practically a zombie at this point. The group go in and stare at the two dead people. Robbie goes on a renewed guilt-fest times a thousand.", "analysis": ""}
