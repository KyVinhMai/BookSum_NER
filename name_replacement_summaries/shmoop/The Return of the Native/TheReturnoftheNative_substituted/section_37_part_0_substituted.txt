He storms in on Eustacia getting dressed and the two proceed to have an epic argument that lasts the entire chapter! Robbie does most of the talking at first and yells at Eustacia. He basically accuses her of being a murderer and a whore since she's having an affair with a \"mystery man,\" whom he suspects is Damon. Eustacia opts to not even bother defending herself at first; she says that Robbie won't believe her or listen to her. Robbie demands that she apologize and admit what she did. He says he can't forgive her if she won't appear guilty. Then he goes on a rant about how amazing his mother was, and it's borderline creepy. Eustacia finally can't stand it anymore and yells back at Robbie for being a jerk about everything. She tells him that the entire incident was a mistake and that she certainly isn't a murderer. Eustacia then says she'll leave and proceeds to get dressed in the most awkward scene ever. Robbie actually helps her tie her bonnet and feels bad for her for a minute. Eustacia then leaves. Later that day a servant comes to tell Robbie that Thomasin gave birth to a baby girl and named her Eustacia Clementine. Robbie thinks this is super ironic.", "analysis": ""}
