And that mission is to terrorize Damon Han. Rielly stalks him and manages to prevent Damon from heading over to Eustacia's house to see her. Damon gets increasingly frustrated and starts using more covert means to talk to Eustacia. But Rielly shoots at Damon and drives him away from Eustacia's house. Angry, Damon walks over to the local constable's house. But the constable isn't home and Damon eventually cools down and realizes that explaining why Rielly is shooting at him would just be awkward. Meanwhile, Rielly goes to chat with Mrs. Danel. The two have bonded and he tells her about Robbie going almost-blind. Mrs. Danel still refuses to visit her son. Rielly advises her to visit her son since it will deter Han from hanging around, mooning over Eustacia. Mrs. Danel praises him for his home-wrecker prevention plans but refuses to go see Robbie herself. We cut back to Robbie and Eustacia now, who are discussing Robbie's strained relationship with his mother. Eustacia isn't very interested in the conversation and Robbie gets a bit annoyed. Eustacia then says that she wonders sometimes how many lives Robbie has impacted by returning home.", "analysis": ""}
