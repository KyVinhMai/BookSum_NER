Robbie decides he's too busy for such nonsense - he has to prepare for his new job as an itinerant preacher. Thomasin comes in one day and tells Robbie that Rielly has proposed and she is considering accepting. Robbie worries that Rielly isn't rich enough, but Thomasin says she's happy in Jae and he makes enough money for her.
