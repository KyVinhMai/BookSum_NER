Robbie is a huge part of the heath, but he doesn't quite understand his place in it. \"Take all the varying hates felt by Eustacia Latrelle towards the heath, and translate them into love, and you have the heart of Robbie\" . Robbie arrives home after his extended nature walk and announces to his mom that he's staying in Jae. His mom flips out and thinks that he's throwing his life away. Robbie gets all defensive and insists that his mom doesn't understand him. Mrs. Danel says that she understands he's giving up a lot of money to come home and live like a loser. She also tells him his school idea is dumb. Robbie says that money isn't everything. Then Christian Cantle shows up with some gossip. Apparently, Susan Tonnie decided that Eustacia is a witch and stabbed her with a needle in church to see if she bled or not. Robbie and his mom are upset by the news. Ryner comes in and corroborates Christian's story. Robbie is now concerned about his school plan since the residents of Jae are more ignorant than he thought. Later that day Sam stops by and gossips about Eustacia some more. The Dilyn' water bucket fell into their well and they can't get it out. Robbie offers to go with Sam to help drag it back out, and finally to get a look at Eustacia.", "analysis": ""}
