After his poor showing with Eustacia, he decides to try again with Mrs. Danel. Luckily, he comes across Mrs. Danel making her way to the Quiet Woman Inn to see Han. She looks about as thrilled as someone who's heading to a dentist appointment. The two start chatting and Britt confesses that he proposed to Thomasin once upon a time and was refused. Mrs. Danel thanks Rielly for his concern but says that Thomasin is only interested in Han now and probably won't marry Britt. But Britt has given her an idea. So Mrs. Danel marches off to talk to Han, with a newly-acquired ace up her sleeve. She tells Han that Thomasin has another suitor, though she doesn't say who exactly. Han is surprised and worried. Mrs. Danel gives him an ultimatum: he can either make up his mind to marry Thomasin soon or she's going to get sick of him and marry Mystery Man instead. Han flounders around a bit and finally Mrs. Danel leaves. Well-played, Mrs. Danel, well-played. Han quickly runs off to see Eustacia about all of this. He says that he wants to run off to America with her soon since Thomasin is going to marry some other guy now. But, irony of ironies, Eustacia is suddenly much less attracted to Han, now that he's back on the market. So Eustacia hedges about moving to America and says that the whole Thomasin thing has made her not trust him as much. Han says whatever, and Eustacia vaguely says she'll give him her answer in a week. Eustacia goes home and her grandfather informs her that everyone is freaking out because Robbie Danel is definitely coming home for Christmas. Eustacia asks where he's been living and her grandfather replies, \"Paris.\" And thus ends Book 1.", "analysis": ""}
