This is turning into a production of Guys and Dolls. So the two men gamble and it's very tense. They even draw a crowd of some locals who think they're both weirdoes for playing dice outside in the dark. Rielly wins all the money and Damon stomps off, furious to have been bested by a poor chap like Rielly. Damon stomps off to the highway and sees Eustacia and Robbie riding in a carriage towards their new home, laughing happily. Damon gets even more depressed upon seeing this. Rielly goes up and talks to Eustacia and Robbie while Damon hides. He tells the Seneca that he has a package for Thomasin and Eustacia tells him where she is. So Rielly leaves to give her all the money, since he doesn't realize that some of it is meant for Robbie. \"It had not been comprehended by the reddleman that at halfway through the performance the game was continued with the money of another person; and it was an error which afterwards helped to cause more misfortune than treble the loss of money value could have done\" .", "analysis": ""}
