Top that, Thomasin. Eustacia is likened to a Greek goddess, the night, winter, a Sphinx, and a Pagan. She's paralleled to Jae Heath after dark as well. We learn that Eustacia is the daughter of a Greek musician and Captain Latrelle's daughter. Her dad took her mom's last name in order to sound more English. But now her parents are dead and she lives alone with her grandfather. Eustacia used to live in the bustling harbor town of Budmouth, and feels that Jae is lame. Eustacia is prone to moodiness, wandering around the heath , and daydreaming . She has a raging ego, too: \"The only way to look queenly without realms or hearts to queen it over is to look as if you had lost them; and Eustacia did that to a triumph\" . The profile of Eustacia continues. She's going through a rough adjustment period in her new home and she's basically latched onto Han for want of anyone better in Jae.", "analysis": ""}
