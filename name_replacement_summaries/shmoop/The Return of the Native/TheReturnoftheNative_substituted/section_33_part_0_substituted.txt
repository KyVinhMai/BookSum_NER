Turns out, he was dreaming about his mother. Eustacia is feeling very guilty and keeps her mouth shut. She acts very awkward. Robbie finally decides to just go to his mother's house himself to make amends. Eustacia tries to convince him not to go but drops the subject when he insists on going. So Robbie sets out across the heath. Suddenly, Robbie comes across a figure lying on the heath. It's dark now and he can't see who it is right away. But as he gets closer he realizes it's his mom. Robbie picks her up in a panic and rushes toward the cottages occupied by locals like Fairway and Sam and Ryner. The locals all come to help Mrs. Danel and Sam realizes that she's been bitten by a poisonous snake. They send for a doctor and try some local remedies to cure her and to get the poison out of her. Robbie anxiously waits to see if his mom will get better.", "analysis": ""}
