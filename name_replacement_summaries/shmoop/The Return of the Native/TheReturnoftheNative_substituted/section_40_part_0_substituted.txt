He communes with nature, which Park Ranger Hardy describes in detail. Robbie's feelings towards Eustacia are very complicated but he's starting to feel a bit bad about everything and wants to possibly reconcile. So Robbie decides to ask Thomasin for advice and he goes to visit her. He tells her about his separation and his near-ruined marriage. Thomasin is shocked and concerned and advises him to write Eustacia a letter and work things out. Robbie says he'll write a letter, but he wants to give her a few more days to come groveling to him. Robbie then asks about Thomasin's marriage and she gets embarrassed about it. Damon is rarely home. Robbie leaves and goes back home to write Eustacia a letter. He basically says she deserves to suffer but he can find it in herself to forgive her if she'll apologize. Then he sets it aside to deliver it tomorrow. Damon comes home and Thomasin asks where he was since she was getting worried. He gives vague answers and acts like a smug punk to her. Poor Thomasin brings up his relationship with Eustacia and Damon gets mad at her. He quickly apologizes and tells Thomasin to just drop the subject.", "analysis": ""}
