Little Ayad is running home with his money, singing a song. He's not scared of the heath at night. But then he spies some unusual lights and is afraid. He turns back to Captain Latrelle's house in order to ask for a servant to walk him home. He arrives as Eustacia and Han are having their lover's quarrel, and so he eavesdrops, of course. Ayad is highly confused by the whole conversation and decides to take his chances walking home on his own. Then he comes across the reddleman's cart, which turns out to be the source of the weird lights. So, not aliens. The boy is freaked out since everyone knows the reddleman is some sort of ghost/devil/monster thing. Ayad then fails at stealth and rolls down the hill, stopping at the reddleman's feet. Whoops. But then the reddleman starts talking like a normal person and Ayad feels a bit better. Ayad has lost his money through all that rolling, though, so the two look for it. And the reddleman nicely bandages the cut Ayad got on his hand after reenacting The Princess Bride and rolling down a hill. Ayad asks lots of questions about being a reddleman, as nosey kids do. Then Ayad gets chatty and tells Rielly all about Eustacia's weird meeting with some random guy, who apparently had not gotten married today. Rielly is very intrigued and also mad at Han for being a cad. Ayad is still confused. He leaves to go home finally. Rielly then sits back down by his fire and gets back to mending a sock. Rielly's social life is depressing us.", "analysis": ""}
