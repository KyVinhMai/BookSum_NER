Eustacia is hanging around outside in her garden, as usual, and Ryner stops by to ask after Robbie. Robbie is still inconsolable. Eustacia goes inside to speak to Robbie. He's super depressed. Eustacia still hasn't said a word to him about not letting his mom in for a visit that day. The two talk in circles since all Robbie can, or wants, to talk about is how guilty he feels and how wonderful his mom was. Robbie wallows and Eustacia stews. Then Thomasin stops by for a visit. Robbie goes on a shame-spiral rant, which really worries Thomasin. Eustacia remains pretty quiet through the whole thing. We learn that Thomasin is going to have her baby in another two months. Robbie just won't stop talking and is obsessed about why his mother said what she did to Ayad before she died. Finally Damon pulls up in his carriage to pick up Thomasin. Eustacia rushes out to speak to him about her own guilt, since Robbie is hogging the guilt spotlight at home. Damon offers up stupid advice, like not telling Robbie he was in the house when Mrs. Danel came to visit. He then wishes that Robbie would just die already and Eustacia gets mad at him. Thomasin comes out and the Hans drive off, with Eustacia watching them from the window.", "analysis": ""}
