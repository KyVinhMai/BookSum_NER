He confronts his wife over dinner one night and asks if she idealized him and saw him as some sort of hero and not a real person. They argue some more and Robbie tells Eustacia that she can go her own way if she needs to and that he loves her anyway. Eustacia cries but then shakes herself out of her funk and decides to go to a party. So she heads out to the village where there's an outdoor festival with dancing. Damon is there too. This spells trouble. The two talk and dance all evening and sparks start flying once again. After the dance, Damon walks Eustacia home and the two talk about their marriages. Thomasin is pregnant and Damon learns about Robbie being nearly blind now. They spy Rielly Britt coming towards them, so Damon sneaks off and Eustacia greets Rielly by herself. Rielly decides it's time to do his super-spy routine again and goes over to Thomasin's house to \"visit\" her husband. Thomasin informs him that Damon isn't home and Rielly grills her for more info. After Damon arrives home he learns that Rielly was there asking for him. Damon is a bit concerned.", "analysis": ""}
