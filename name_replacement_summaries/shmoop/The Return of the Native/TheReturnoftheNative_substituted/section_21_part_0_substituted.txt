Robbie says, whatever, and leaves anyway. The local men try to get some rope around the bucket and drag it back out, but they keep having trouble since the bucket is water-logged and heavy now. Robbie offers to take Timothy Fairway's place and to be lowered down some into the well to get the bucket. Eustacia pipes up from the house and says to tie a rope around Robbie since he might fall in the well. But it's getting late and the men say they'll have to come back tomorrow. Eustacia is bummed that she doesn't have water. Robbie offers to send her some water, but Eustacia says it's cool since she technically has pond water, even though it's gross. The two walk over to the pond and Robbie notices the ashes from the November bonfire. Robbie gallantly volunteers to try again for the bucket and Eustacia helps him. But Eustacia just ends up with rope burn. Robbie looks her over and also checks out her stab wound, courtesy of crazy Susan - what a day for Eustacia. The two talk about Robbie's school plans and Eustacia shows some interest. Robbie learns that Eustacia isn't happy in Jae and longs for city life. The two part and are smitten with each other. The next day Robbie studies hard and then goes for a walk, where he meets Eustacia. Upon returning home, his mom grills him. Things get steadily more awkward between mother and son. A few days later, Christian swings by with some gossip. He tells Mrs. Danel that some people dug up some ancient urns on the heath. Robbie was going to bring one home but gave it to Eustacia instead. Mrs. Danel is peeved. Spring arrives and, with it, nature descriptions. Robbie keeps wandering around and keeping weird hours. The Seneca finally have a throw-down argument, which has been building for weeks. They fight over Eustacia. Mrs. Danel calls her a hussy, while Robbie defends his girlfriend. Finally Robbie storms out and stays out very late.", "analysis": ""}
