The locals all cheer when they see Diggory and Thomasin and everyone heads off for the wedding feast. Clym opts to not attend since he's still too depressed. Clym walks to Captain Vye's house and spies Charley, who is also still depressed. Charley walks home with Clym, and Clym gives Charley a lock of Eustacia's hair to keep. The two watch the wedding reception party going on outside. Thomasin comes back in as the party winds down to tell Clym good-bye since she's heading off to Diggory's house now. We go forward in time - Clym does work as an itinerant preacher and spends the rest of his life mourning his mother and his wife. People always treat him kindly throughout his life since they feel so sorry for him.", "analysis": ""}
