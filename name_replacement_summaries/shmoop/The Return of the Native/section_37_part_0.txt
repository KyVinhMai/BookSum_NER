He storms in on Eustacia getting dressed and the two proceed to have an epic argument that lasts the entire chapter! Clym does most of the talking at first and yells at Eustacia. He basically accuses her of being a murderer and a whore since she's having an affair with a \"mystery man,\" whom he suspects is Damon. Eustacia opts to not even bother defending herself at first; she says that Clym won't believe her or listen to her. Clym demands that she apologize and admit what she did. He says he can't forgive her if she won't appear guilty. Then he goes on a rant about how amazing his mother was, and it's borderline creepy. Eustacia finally can't stand it anymore and yells back at Clym for being a jerk about everything. She tells him that the entire incident was a mistake and that she certainly isn't a murderer. Eustacia then says she'll leave and proceeds to get dressed in the most awkward scene ever. Clym actually helps her tie her bonnet and feels bad for her for a minute. Eustacia then leaves. Later that day a servant comes to tell Clym that Thomasin gave birth to a baby girl and named her Eustacia Clementine. Clym thinks this is super ironic.", "analysis": ""}
