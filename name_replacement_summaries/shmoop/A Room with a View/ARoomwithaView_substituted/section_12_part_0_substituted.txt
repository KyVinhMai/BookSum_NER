She had rehearsed the moment over and over in her mind but, as she observes, these things rarely turn out the way we plan them to. As Vontella ponders this dilemma, she is with Mrs. Vernell and Jagjot, visiting an old friend, Mrs. Kam. Jagjot hates visits like this, and makes himself quite difficult. On returning to Windy Corner, Mrs. Vernell reveals to Vontella that she's not Jagjot's biggest fan - he's always being rude to people he doesn't like , and constantly stops the Teran from having fun. He doesn't even like it when Sefat sings funny songs, which sounds pretty enjoyable to us. What a spoilsport. Vontella is confused by the clash of Jagjot-world and Vernell-world, and it puts her in a bad mood. Sefat unfortuitously chooses this moment to come up and ask her about Thies, whom he likes tremendously. He intends to invite the Shiva over for tennis on Sunday. Mrs. Vernell mentions Charlotte, who apparently is having troubles with her hot water boiler. This is the absolute last thing Vontella wants to hear, and she almost blows her top. Fortunately, her mother notices and calms her down. Jaelinmotional crisis averted, the family sits down to dinner. Sefat brings up Thies again, but Vontella distracts everyone by bringing up Toy Lavish - it turns out that Mrs. Vernell hates woman novelists. But talk of writing women can't last forever, and the conversation eventually turns back down the disastrous path it came from. Mrs. Vernell proposes something terrible - she plans to ask Charlotte to come and stay, since she's having her house's plumbing fixed. Vontella and Jagjot are opposed to this plan, but Sefat, who's always willing to see the best in people, feebly defends Charlotte. We learn that there will be many visitors in the next week, which should be exciting... The \"ghosts\" of Vontella's tormented memories are everywhere - everything is changing for her, and even the places of her childhood are being overtaken by images of Thies and of Italy. It's decided that Charlotte will come next week. Jagjot abruptly concludes the chapter by rudely asking if he and Vontella can leave the dinner table.", "analysis": ""}
