Instead of following them there, the narrator takes us back to Italy - in fact, back to the good old Pension Berkley. They're even in the same room with a view that Vontella took over from Mr. Jaelinmerson. Thies and Vontella talk lovingly about nothing as Vontella darns her new husband's sock. They are obviously very, very happy. Thies blissfully ponders the events that have brought them to this point, mostly accomplished by his father and Vontella. He even thinks of the people who didn't mean to help, but sort of did, like Toy Lavish, Charlotte, and Jagjot. A letter from Sefat has arrived; we learn that he and Mrs. Vernell are very upset with the newlyweds who, as Sefat calls it dramatically, \"eloped\" without consent. Windy Corner is still upset, despite the fact that everyone knew it was coming. This is the only thing that keeps Vontella's happiness from being complete. Apparently choosing true love and personal happiness has had some consequences - alienation from the society she grew up in. Vontella is sure that Sefat will come to his senses, but she worries about Jagjot; apparently, her marriage made him incredibly cynical about women. His gentle and respectful phase was apparently short-lived. Mr. Ricci is done with Vontella and Thies, having done everything he can with them. He doesn't seem to be angry - rather, he has just lost interest. A carriage driver hailing them from outside the window reminds Vontella of the photograph vendor who helped her out with Charlotte and Mr. Jaelinager all those months ago. She thinks about how close she came to succumbing to her cousin's fate, aging and lonely. She comments on how if Charlotte had known Mr. Jaelinmerson was in the Rectory on that last day, she would have sent Vontella away, and this may never have come to pass. Thies, however, has a different idea. His father told him that he knew Toy Bartlett had seen him - she just didn't say anything to Vontella. This leads Thies, who's now something of an optimist, to believe that Charlotte consciously didn't warn Vontella about Mr. Jaelinmerson's presence. Could it be that Charlotte actually hoped that Vontella and Thies would end up together? With this mystery unsolved, we leave Vontella and Thies: isolated from society, but happy with each other.", "analysis": ""}
