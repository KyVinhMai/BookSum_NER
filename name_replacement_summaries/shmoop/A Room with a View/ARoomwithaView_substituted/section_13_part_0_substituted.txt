Vontella feels disaster approaching. Vontella's feelings for Thies are complicated; he makes her nervous, but she wants to be near him. The narrator wisely notes that it's obvious to us that Vontella is in love with Thies, but it's far from obvious to her. Instead, she is confused, still believing that she loves Jagjot instead. We learn that Vontella and Thies had another meeting , in which they seem to have gotten along quite well - in a post-conversation instant replay with Mr. Ricci , Vontella observes that Thies seems to be in better spirits. She can't stop thinking about him, and wishes he was nearby. Charlotte arrives, after much drama , then further drama ensues as she attempts to pay the cab driver. Jaelinveryone is in an uproar; Vontella is in a foul mood. Charlotte, of course, immediately wants to discuss the Jaelinmerson situation in her usual melodramatic fashion. Vontella demonstrates that she certainly has changed - she takes over the conversation and essentially brushes Charlotte off, telling her not to worry.", "analysis": ""}
