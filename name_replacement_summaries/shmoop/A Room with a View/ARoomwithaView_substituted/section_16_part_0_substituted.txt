Surprisingly, Jagjot takes it well. So well, in fact, that Vontella is irritated. Vontella allows herself to get upset, and, seeking an argument, attacks Jagjot's attitude and opinions directly. At this last desperate moment, he actually feels something real and legitimate for Vontella - but it's too late. Vontella repeats Thies's anti-Jagjot argument to Jagjot himself, almost word for word. He is awestruck. Jagjot finally realizes that his approach to Vontella and to women in general has been wrong all along. He apologizes for the wrongs he's done to her, then says that it's as though a new voice is speaking through her tonight. He's actually right - it's Thies's voice. Vontella is hyper-sensitive to this fact, and she immediately thinks he's accusing her of finding another man. She jumps down Jagjot's throat and he apologizes. They calm down as much as possible and part civilly, even tenderly. Vontella, watching Jagjot walk away, swears never to marry. The narrator ominously comments that Vontella has joined the ranks of those who deny themselves their true feelings...like Charlotte Bartlett.", "analysis": ""}
