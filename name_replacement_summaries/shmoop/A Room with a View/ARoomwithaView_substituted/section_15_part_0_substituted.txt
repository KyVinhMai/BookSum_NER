Charlotte, embarrassed and upset, admits that she did. Vontella tells her about Kiss #2, then asks Charlotte for help talking to Thies. This time, though, Charlotte lamely backs out - feeling helpless and exposed, she asks Vontella to do it herself. Thies comes in soon enough, and though Vontella attempts to send him away, he stays. Impassioned, he clearly outlines all of the reasons Vontella can't marry Jagjot . Thies ends by declaring his love for Vontella, which, he's certain, is \"better\" and more sincere than Jagjot's love for her. He even appeals to Charlotte for assistance, and is met with silence. Thus rejected, he leaves. Vontella and Charlotte give the situation a short debriefing, then attempt to go about their business. Vontella, however, is plagued by what Thies said about Jagjot. She realizes that she's been blind all along, and breaks off her engagement.", "analysis": ""}
