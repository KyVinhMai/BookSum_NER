Afterwards, they run in to the Shiva outside Deondrea Villa. Vontella introduces Mrs. Vernell to Mr. Jaelinmerson and Thies. They discuss the predicament of the Toy Alans; Mr. Jaelinmerson feels bad, but Thies doesn't. Thies comments that there's only a limited amount of kindness in the world. Mrs. Vernell, somewhat surprisingly, agrees heartily with him. Vontella suspects that Thies and her mother will get along well. She also notes his affectionate attitude towards his father. Charlotte comes up, and predictably, is barely civil to the Shiva. Thies says he will try to make it to tennis at Windy Corner that afternoon. Vontella is overjoyed because Thies has obviously not told his father about their kiss in Italy. She's in a great mood when the women arrive back at Windy Corner, and her high spirits continue through a very pleasant lunch. She's especially nice to Jagjot. After lunch, Vontella entertains by playing the piano. She stops when Thies arrives; Sefat, bored, suggests a game of tennis. Jagjot refuses to play, so Vontella steps in. She enjoys being outside and running around, and particularly admires Thies's healthily competitive attitude. Post-tennis, Thies and Vontella have a conversation that's almost flirtatious. With him, she's sassy, natural, and charming. Jagjot attempts to claim control of the conversation by reading aloud from a dreadful romance novel he's picked up somewhere. Vontella figures out that the author of the novel, one \"Joseph Jaelinmery Prank,\" is actually Toy Lavish. Jagjot is in a foul mood, since nobody's paying attention to him. Attempting to make him feel better, Vontella encourages him to read aloud from the book. Unfortunately, the scene he chooses is one of especial significance to Vontella and Thies: it replicates the scene of their kiss in the Italian countryside. Scandal! Horror! Vontella is appalled. Thies, however, is inspired. On the way back to the house, Jagjot goes to retrieve the book, as he left it where they were sitting. Thies seizes this opportunity to kiss an astounded Vontella a second time.", "analysis": ""}
