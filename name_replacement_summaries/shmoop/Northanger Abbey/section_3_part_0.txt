She's stuck talking to Mrs. Allen again. But then a random lady comes up and says she remembers Mrs. Allen from school. It turns out this is Mrs. Allen's old friend Mrs. Thorpe, who totally tracked her down on Facebook. Oh, wait. Mrs. Thorpe brags about her sons and Mrs. Allen can only fake interest since she has no kids. Luckily for Catherine, Mrs. Thorpe has three daughters around Catherine's age. The eldest, Isabella, is twenty-one, and is introduced as the best looking by Mrs. Thorpe. Isabella is thus the Marcia Brady of her family. In a remarkable coincidence, Isabella's brother John is best friends with Catherine's brother James at Oxford. So Catherine and Isabella promptly become best friends too. Catherine and Isabella gossip about fashion, boys, dances, and London, which Isabella knows all about since she's visited like two times or something. Isabella is four years older and dazzles Catherine with all her worldly experience and Catherine is a bit awed by her at first. The two new friends are thrilled to find out that they are both attending the theater tonight and will be attending the same church the next day. The narrator closes the chapter by telling us that Mrs. Thorpe is a widow and the family does not have much money.", "analysis": ""}
