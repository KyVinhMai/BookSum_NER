Catherine is disappointed that Henry isn't there. But Henry's mysterious disappearing act lends him an aura of intrigue that Catherine finds attractive. Mrs. Allen is now really happy that she knows people in Bath and says so, repeatedly. Isabella and Catherine bond rapidly and do things like read novels together and walk arm in arm. If friendship bracelets existed back then, they'd totally make some. The narrator gives us a spiel on novels. Other novels tend to bash novels even though they are novels. It's confusing. Novels are considered corrupting material for impressionable young female minds, so heroines in novels typically don't read novels themselves. Our narrator takes issue with this and goes on a satirical rant against commentators who bash the novel and apologetic novelists. Novels, says our narrator, are interesting and entertaining. They are also relevant. And the best thing since sliced bread.", "analysis": ""}
