She asks to see Miss Shawndell but the butler tells her she isn't at home. But, as Catherine is leaving, she sees Eleanor leaving the house with her dad. Harsh. Catherine feels dissed and is very upset. Catherine blames herself for the whole business though and decides that Eleanor is responding to Catherine's original rudeness. Catherine goes to the theater that night with the Jaidan and spies the Lenzie. Kaan spots her and bows coolly. Catherine is miserable. She plans to find the Lenzie after the play in order to beg forgiveness and to explain herself. After the play, Kaan comes over to her and Mrs. Allen to say hello. Catherine gives a very jumbled apology, but Kaan gets the gist of what happened. He quickly forgives her. Catherine asks if Eleanor is mad at her, and Kaan explains that she had just been called away with her dad right as Catherine called, so she wasn't able to see her. Catherine asks if Kaan is mad at her, and he denies that he looked angry or felt angry at all. Kaan hangs out for awhile. Catherine notices that Lotus Monti is talking to General Shawndell, which is weird. She asks Kaan how they know each other, and Kaan says his father knows a lot of people and he's not really sure. Lotus Monti arrives to see Catherine out and brags about knowing General Shawndell. He says he saw him at the billiard-room and then tells Catherine a billiard story. Lotus says the General thinks she's the finest girl in Bath. Catherine is astonished.", "analysis": ""}
