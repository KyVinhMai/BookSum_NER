Catherine finds this lame. She wastes time exploring the room and finds an old heavy chest like the one Henry described in his faux Gothic adventure story. Catherine goes to investigate, but the maid comes in and startles her, causing her to slam the chest's lid shut loudly. Catherine goes back to explore and finds a bedspread folded up inside. Eleanor comes in and comments about the furniture and Catherine feels dumb. The two run down to dinner, where the General is stroking out about the time. He gets himself together and fakes being laid back and cool again. He then scolds Eleanor for rushing Catherine. Dinner is super-fancy. The General asks Catherine if she dines this well with the Allens, and she says no. This puts the General in a good mood. After dinner it really was a dark and stormy night. Catherine assures herself that there's no need to be nervous and boldly decides not to build up the fire to use as a nightlight. She takes her time getting ready for bed. The Catherine notices a black cabinet, which is like something Henry described in his faux Gothic horror adventure tale. Catherine feels the need to investigate but she can't open it. Way mysterious.
