Mrs. Morland isn't very savvy and gives Catherine some less than useful advice about her first trip to a big town, telling her to dress warm and stuff like that. Catherine's sister Sally does not care that Catherine is leaving - probably because she gets a room to herself for once. Mr. Morland gives Catherine a small amount of money and tells her to ask for more later if she wants it. So much for Catherine's unlimited shopping spree. The Allens and Catherine travel to Bath. It's pretty boring. They arrive in Bath and go to their lodgings. Mrs. Allen is obsessed with fashion, and is also a bit dimwitted, just FYI. She takes Catherine shopping for days. Catherine gets her hair cut and styled too. Finally, the Allens and Catherine attend their first ball in Bath and it's very crowded. Mr. Allen goes off to play cards. Catherine and Mrs. Allen struggle through the crowd till they find a bench where they can watch all the fashionable people dance. Mrs. Allen isn't much of a conversationalist and Catherine starts getting bored. They all go for tea, which is like party refreshments, but it's still really crowded and Catherine starts getting annoyed by all the people. She finds it uncomfortable since she doesn't know anyone there. Mrs. Allen and Catherine have to sit at a table with strangers during tea and it's really awkward. Mrs. Allen keeps wishing they knew someone there and commenting on the fashion. Finally Mr. Allen comes back from his card game and they all make their way to an exit. Catherine gets noticed by some guys on the way out and overhears two of them say she is pretty. Catherine is way excited.", "analysis": ""}
