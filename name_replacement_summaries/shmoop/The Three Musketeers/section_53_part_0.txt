In the morning, she stays in bed when Felton walks into the corridor outside her room. A serving woman walks in to attend to Milady, who looks pale and complains of a fever. The woman asks if Milady wants a physician. Milady replies that it would be pointless. Milady continues to complain, and Felton threatens to fetch Lord de Winter. Felton brings a book containing a Catholic mass for Milady. She detects that Felton is not a Catholic, and that this can be used to her advantage. She rapidly pretends to be a Puritan without actually telling Felton this fact straight out. Lord de Winter later visits her and makes fun of her religious conversion. Felton overhears the entire conversation. Later that evening, Milady prays aloud. An old servant of hers was a Puritan; Milady co-opts the prayers for her own ends. She pretends to be in a religious ecstasy as Felton orders the dinner table brought in. She finishes her prayers and eats only a little. The table is cleared out and Milady notes with joy that Felton does not accompany them--clearly he is afraid of seeing her too often. She begins to sing pure Puritan verses. Her voice is incredible and is heard throughout the castle. It is clear Felton has been moved. He goes to visit her room and believes he sees an angel. Incoherently, he stammers out that she should not sing so loud next time.", "analysis": ""}
