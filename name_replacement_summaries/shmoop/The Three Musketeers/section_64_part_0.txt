He calls for the four lackeys. Each is to take a different route to the village: Planchet is given the honor of following the road Milady's carriage was seen to take. The four lackeys are to begin their mission the next morning. Athos then gets up, puts on his sword, and goes in search of a particular house. It is very curious, however, that when he asks how to get to this house, passers-by are terrified and refuse to accompany him. The Musketeer enters the house and explains to the owner exactly what he wants. The owner is at first reluctant to accept this mission, but Athos threatens the man's life until he assents. Athos returns to find Planchet waiting for him. Planchet reports that Milady is in Armentieres at an inn called the Post, currently being guarded by the other three lackeys. Everyone gets ready to leave for Armentieres when Athos says that one person is still missing. He leaves and then returns with a man in a large red cloak. Once he arrives, the friends set off.", "analysis": ""}
