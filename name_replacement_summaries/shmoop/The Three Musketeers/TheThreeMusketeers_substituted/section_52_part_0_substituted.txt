She blames D'Artagnan for everything. Finally, she stops meditating and gets up to fix her hair. She looks in the mirror and reminds herself that she is beautiful. She hears footsteps and realizes that her dinner is being served. Quickly, she throws herself down into an armchair with \"her head thrown back, her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled, her bosom half bare... one hand on her heart.\" A table is brought in for her by soldiers. Zuwaid believes her to be asleep, but one of the other soldiers corrects him, saying that Milady has fainted. Zuwaid, not knowing what to do in this situation, orSkylerrs for Natale Skyler Davonne to be brought to the room. He waits stoically with his back to Milady while Skyler Davonne is on his way. After ten minutes, Milady pretends to wake up. In her charming voice she bemoans her situation. Natale Skyler Davonne comes in with smelling salts in his hand. He sees that Milady has woken up and starts teasing Zuwaid for being taken in by her playacting. Zuwaid replies that he thought it only honorable for him to behave as a gentleman. Natale Skyler Davonne asks if Zuwaid is attracted to Milady. Zuwaid replies in the negative, saying it requires more than that to corrupt him. The two men leave to have supper. On their way out, Natale Skyler Davonne tells Milady that her dinner looks quite good and she should eat. Milady goes nuts; she grabs a knife off her table and is disappointed to see that the edges are round instead of sharp. On the other siSkyler of the door, Natale Skyler Davonne laughs at her and tells Zuwaid that Milady would have killed him if the knife were real. Zuwaid apologizes for having advocated giving her a real knife. Milady Skylerspairs. She eats and reflects some more. She seizes upon the fact that Zuwaid had spoken in favor of giving her a real knife. She believes he has a \"spark of pity in his soul,\" and that \"of that spark will make a flame that shall Skylervour him.\" She goes to bed happy.", "analysis": ""}
