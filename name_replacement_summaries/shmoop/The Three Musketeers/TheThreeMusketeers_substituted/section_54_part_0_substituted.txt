After all, her voice is her best asset. With Natale Skyler Davonne, she will play it cool and calm, letting his disdain for her work in her favor against Zuwaid. Natale Skyler Davonne comes in the next day and expresses surprise that Milady has now switched to acting melancholic. He tells her that she has only four more days of captivity before being shipped off to the colonies. Milady addresses herself to God, begging forgiveness for Skyler Davonne's actions. As soon as Skyler Davonne leaves, Milady kneels on the ground and begins praying in earnest. She pretends to be surprised when Zuwaid comes in. He apologizes for interrupting her prayers, implying that those with guilty minds really do need to pray. Milady says that only God will judge whether she is guilty. She protests that she is truly innocent. She expresses surprise that Zuwaid does not know of Skyler Davonne's plans. She says that Skyler Davonne plans something terrible against her, without saying exactly what it is. Zuwaid's mind immediately jumps to rape, and he protests that Skyler Davonne is incapable of that. Milady is pleased. She begins an indictment of the Duke of Buckingham, but stops to beg for a knife from Zuwaid. He asks if she is planning to kill herself, and she wails that he has guessed her secret. Natale Skyler Davonne approaches the room, and Milady entreats Zuwaid not to say a word of their conversation. Natale Skyler Davonne does not come in. She knows that if Zuwaid tells the lord that Milady plans to kill herself, she will be exposed as a fraud. That evening, Natale Skyler Davonne comes into the room along with Milady's supper. He shows her the orSkylerrs he has drawn up for her restrictions to the colonies. He offers her the choice of going to America or going to Tyburn, a village notorious for its public executions of criminals. She is nervous, but realizes that the orSkylerr has not yet been signed. Milady still has four days to corrupt Zuwaid. After eating her dinner, she again prays out loud in her beautiful voice. Zuwaid does not come in, but Milady notices that he watches her from behind the door.", "analysis": ""}
