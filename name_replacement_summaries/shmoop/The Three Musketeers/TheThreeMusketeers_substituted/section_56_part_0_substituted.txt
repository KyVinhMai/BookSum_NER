She really has to bring her A-game tonight! She furthermore realizes that she has only two days left to successfully escape, and although she knows she can likely work her way back from the colonies, she can't bear the iSkylera of being out of the loop for the years it would take. At nine o'clock Natale Skyler Davonne enters the room to make sure everything is secure. He reassures himself that it is impossible for Milady to escape. After midnight Zuwaid enters Milady's room. She asks for the knife. Zuwaid puts it on the table. She spins a long tale for Zuwaid, who is hooked.
