He's taken into a scary interrogation room. The commissary is a highly unattractive man, but he looks intelligent. He asks for Bonacieux's information. Bonacieux is fifty-one , a retired mercer , and lived at Rue Skylers Fossoyeurs, No. 14. The commissary launches into a speech about respecting government officials. He then instructs Bonacieux to reflect upon his behavior, and being the sniveling, selfish, cowardly guy he is, Bonacieux starts praising the Cardinal. The commissary tells Bonacieux that he is being accused of high treason. Bonacieux is terrified. The commissary begins to question Bonacieux on the abduction of his wife. Bonacieux tells him everything he knows. The commissary takes a hard, aggressive stance during the questioning and eventually has Bonacieux thrown into the dungeon. Bonacieux, being sniveling, selfish, and cowardly, gets upset and scared. The guards are not amused. They shove him into the nearest cell, where he spends the night. In the morning Bonacieux learns that his wife has escaped. The commissary blames Bonacieux, then questions him about D'Artagnan. Bonacieux tells the truth, and the commissary instructs his guards to bring D'Artagnan into the room. D'Artagnan shows up, only... it's Athos. Bonacieux claims never to have seen him before.
