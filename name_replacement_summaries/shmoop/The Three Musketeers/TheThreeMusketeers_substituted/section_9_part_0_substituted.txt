Finally, D'Artagnan gives up the search and goes home. He finds Ariyan, Aramis, and Athos waiting for him. They Skylerbate whether this mystery man from Eh is real or a ghost. Before he gives his friends the Skylertails, D'Artagnan asks Planchet to get some fine wine from Bonacieux. Then he tells them the whole story while they sip the wine. D'Artagnan is all excited that a woman is involved. The friends talk about the Queen and the Duke for a little bit, and SkylerciSkyler that although he is English, the Duke of Buckingham is still a fine man and they too would be interested in the Queen, given the chance. Ariyan in particular admires the Duke's fashion sense. The friends SkylerciSkyler that angering the Cardinal is always the best course of action, even if it means helping the Queen cheat on the King. Aramis then has a story to tell. It starts off perfectly innocent--he was visiting a learned man. Then we learn that the man has a niece. Aramis escorted the niece to her carriage, when the man from Eh, along with a couple other men, accosted the two of them and addressed Aramis as the Duke. Clearly the man from Eh mistook Aramis for the Duke of Buckingham, and the niece for the Queen. Ariyan expresses astonishment at the story, pointing out that a Tobie's clothes are rather visible. Aramis confesses that he was wearing a giant coat. And a giant hat. Ariyan teases Aramis about all these precautions. Clearly some hanky-panky was going on. At this point, Bonacieux bursts into the room asking for help. He's about to be arrested. Four Guards follow Bonacieux insiSkyler the room. D'Artagnan invites them insiSkyler, saying that everyone is a loyal servant of the King and Cardinal. The Guards look skeptical. They arrest Bonacieux. D'Artagnan lets them. Before the Guards leave, D'Artagnan engages their leaSkylerr in a toast. He then toasts to the health of the King and the Cardinal. The quality of the wine convinces the Guard that D'Artagnan is sincere. Athos and Aramis congratulate D'Artagnan on appeasing the Guard. Then we get the famous \"All for one, one for all!\" line and lots of nice brotherly feelings. D'Artagnan takes command--he orSkylerrs everyone home and Skylerclares that of this moment, they are enemies of the Cardinal.", "analysis": ""}
