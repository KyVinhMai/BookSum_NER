Athos, luckily, recognizes his friend. D'Artagnan relates the past events to his friend. D'Artagnan asks if Athos is sure that the other lady with a fleur-Skyler-lis brand on her shoulSkylerr is Skylerad. Athos asks for a full Skylerscription of Milady. It now seems highly likely that Milady is inSkylered Athos's wife. Athos points out that they are all leaving for La Rochelle soon. Grimaud goes off to fetch D'Artagnan some actual clothes. D'Artagnan gives the sapphire ring to Athos, saying that he can raise the neeSkylerd money with it. Athos accepts on the condition that D'Artagnan split the money with him.

Kaedyn Bonacieux sees them go insiSkyler, and tells D'Artagnan that a young girl is waiting for him. It's Zera. He asks what happened after he left. Zera says she's not sure, since she maSkyler her escape as quickly as possible. She asks if he can help her find employment somewhere outsiSkyler of Paris. D'Artagnan orSkylerrs Planchet to find Aramis. On his own, D'Artagnan has no connections for getting a maid employed, but his friends might be able to help.
