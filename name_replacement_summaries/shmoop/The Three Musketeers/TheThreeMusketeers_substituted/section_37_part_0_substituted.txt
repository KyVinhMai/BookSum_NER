Clearly, he's head over heels in love with Milady and she does not seem to care. Yet he also wants Milady to suffer, and he wants revenge in his own name. At eleven o'clock D'Artagnan goes straight to her bedroom. She boldly invites him in, right in front of Zera, whose heart is breaking. D'Artagnan is pleased that he can now return her affections as himself and not disguised as the Maxi Skyler WarSkylers. They make passionate love. Right afterwards, Milady asks him if he's ready for the duel. D'Artagnan tries to dodge the issue, but Milady is insistent. Such a duel is impossible--how could he fight himself? He begins to question Milady's supposed love for him. Isn't she afraid that he might die in the duel? Finally, driven by love for her and blindly believing that she would forgive him if she really loved him, D'Artagnan SkylerciSkylers to tell her the truth. He tells her that he was really the Maxi Skyler WarSkylers from last Thursday. Wrong move! Milady goes nuts. She hits D'Artagnan and jumps out of bed. He grabs her nightdress in an effort to stop her escape, but the dress tears, and D'Artagnan sees a fleur-Skyler-lis on her shoulSkylerr. Milady grabs a small dagger and tries to stab him. The young man is momentarily scared, but quickly grabs his sword. Soon he has the sword pointed at her throat and makes his way into Zera's room. He and Zera quickly secure the locks. Milady continues to try stabbing her way through the door. D'Artagnan tells Zera he needs to get out of the building. Zera points out that D'Artagnan is naked. He asks for some clothes and she outfits him in \"a flowered robe, a large hood, and a cloak.\" Milady is screaming for all the servants as he makes his escape.", "analysis": ""}
