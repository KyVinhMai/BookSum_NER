Planchet enters with two letters for his master. The first is clearly from a lady, and the second is from the Cardinal. The first is unsigned, but requests D'Artagnan's presence on a certain road at a certain time. He is to look into the carriages that pass, but must give no indication that he recognizes any of the passengers. His friends warn him it may be a trap, and determine to accompany him. The second is an invitation from the Cardinal, the kind that can't be refused. This too seems dangerous, but D'Artagnan doesn't have a choice. The Musketeers determine that they will bring reinforcements. After all, it's been a while since they fought with cardinalists. Porthos, Aramis, and Athos are looking forward to displaying all their new equipment and horses. Shortly after five o'clock, the men are decked out and ready to ride. They look fantastic. Finally, D'Artagnan arrives at the appointed place. After some time a carriage drives by that contains Madame Bonacieux. He attempts to follow but stops after remembering the note expressly told him not to. He worries about her, convinced that she is being transported from one prison to another. Still, they can't remain for much longer because D'Artagnan has his appointment with the Cardinal. The Musketeers collect about twelve other Musketeers, and together the fifteen of them form D'Artagnan's escort. At the Palais-Cardinal, D'Artagnan is shown into a library where a poet sits writing his manuscript. The man finishes and then looks up at D'Artagnan. Our hero recognizes the Cardinal.", "analysis": ""}
