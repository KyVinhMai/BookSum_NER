She says that her captor entered the room with an executioner who branded her with the fleur-de-lis. She ignores Felton's demands to know the identity of her captor as she bares the brand on her shoulder. Felton is completely enthralled. He falls to her feet, begging her pardon for having been her jailer. He kisses her feet. Felton asks again for the identity of her persecutor. Without saying the name aloud, Milady implicates the Duke of Buckingham. Felton swears to kill him. Milady explains Lord de Winter's was furious that his brother had married a penniless girl. She says that her husband knew her story and had sworn to kill Buckingham, but had died before he could do so. Milady again pretends to despair and demands the knife. Felton refuses; he swears she will live with honor. He swears the two of them will live and die together, and kisses her. The guard knocks on the door. Felton opens it, only to hear that his desperate cries on behalf of Milady had summoned both guard and sergeant. Milady runs over with the knife, demanding to know why Felton has a right to prevent her suicide. Lord de Winter overhears and begins laughing. He tells Felton there's no way Milady will go through with it. Milady, understanding that she has to give Felton proof of her intention, stabs herself. Except she stabs herself in such a way that it hits the underwire on her bra. Felton is upset and grabs the knife. Lord de Winter orders him to go, and then send for a physician. Felton leaves with Milady's knife in hand.", "analysis": ""}
