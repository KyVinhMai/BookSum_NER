Luckily, he knows his murderer: surprise! It's Claudius! But how? The ghost reveals the details: While he was sleeping in his orchard, Claudius snuck over and poured poison in his ear. Hamlet promises to avenge his father's death. Let's all take a moment to underline this or highlight it or whatever you do. Hamlet promises to avenge his father. He does, no fingers crossed behind his back or anything. Got it? Good. The ghost is as happy as a ghost can be, but he warns Hamlet not to do anything to Gertrude, his mother. Hamlet comes back and swears his friends to secrecy. He also warns them that he might start behaving strangely, but it's cool: he's just acting on instructions given to him by the ghost of his dead father. Specifically, he says he's going to put on an \"antic disposition,\" which means he's going to pretend to be crazy, like an \"antic\" . Also, everyone pinky swears to not tell anyone anything. The ghost's disembodied voice adds that they had really better be swearing. Yep, he's as creepy in person as he is on paper.", "analysis": ""}
