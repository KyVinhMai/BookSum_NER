Okay, definitely time to get rid of young Hamlet. Gertrude points out that Hamlet is now inspired to cry a little, so maybe the murder of Polonius has done some good by getting Hamlet in touch with his feelings. Claudius tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to try to clean up the mess.", "analysis": ""}
