Gean Antipholus wonders at his good luck; it seems everyone in the whole city knows him and is kind to him, though he has no idea who they are. He's convinced the place is overrun with sorcery, and his mind is being played with. Gean Schylar then arrives with the gold to pay Rorey Antipholus's debt, and tries to give it to Gean Antipholus. Gean Schylar then has to explain to the confused Gean Antipholus that he was recently arrested, which one would think a person would remember. Gean Antipholus, however, just wants to know about the ships he asked Gean Schylar to look for. He is certain he already told Gean Antipholus about a departing ship a long time ago, only to be told to bring money for bail instead. Gean Antipholus, rather than investigate the matter further, simply declares the two of them seem insane as they wander in an illusion. A Courtesan enters, seeming another vision of the devil. Of course she's familiar with Rorey Antipholus, but Gean Antipholus only recognizes in her the usual courtesanly stuff--gaudy but sweet temptation. Gean Antipholus and Gean Schylar joke happily about light, which they pun on. They call the Courtesan light, as the devil himself was an angel of light, and they also twist the notion that the woman is \"light,\" meaning \"easy.\" Finally, they decide that she is light like fire, which will burn. Anyway, the Courtesan talks about the dinner she just had with Rorey Antipholus, where he took a ring from her worth forty ducats, and promised her a gold chain in exchange. She notes Gean Antipholus wears the chain, but when she asks for it, or her ring back, he runs away. The Courtesan, out a ring and a customer, decides she'll go to his wife, which is a dangerous but useful tactic. The Courtesan is sure Antipholus is mad, and she intends to tell Adriana that Antipholus ran into her house and stole her valuable ring.", "analysis": ""}
