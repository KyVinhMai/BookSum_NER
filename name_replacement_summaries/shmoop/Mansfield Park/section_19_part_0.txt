{"name": "Chapter 20", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061744/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mansfield-park/summary/chapter-20", "summary": "Edmund goes to apologize to his dad for his involvement in the Theater Club. He does try to vindicate, or defend, his own actions as still super moral, though. Edmund also insists that Fanny is totally blameless in the whole thing. Sir Thomas forgives Edmund and tries to forget all about the theater hullabaloo. He'd rather believe that his kids learned a lesson and won't do it again than find out the truth about it all. Sir Thomas is not happy with Mrs. Norris, though, since she was supposed to be the adult chaperone. Mrs. Norris goes into a super long spiel defending herself that gets increasingly ridiculous as she goes on. Sir Thomas finally gives up since she shows no signs of shutting up any time soon. Sir Thomas has all the theater sets torn down and burns all the copies of the play. Mr. Yates thinks that Sir Thomas is the most evil person ever since he clearly hates the theater. Maria is starting to get worried about Henry since he hasn't said anything to her dad. Then Maria overhears Henry talking with Tom. Henry's leaving town and has no plans to return any time soon. Henry then tells Maria that he has to leave but would stay if he could. Maria doesn't buy it. Maria is horrified. But she tries to recover herself and act like there's nothing wrong. Julia is glad he's leaving since she's angry with him by now and just wants him gone. Fanny's also glad he's leaving, but Mrs. Norris is confused that things didn't work out with Henry and Julia. Mr. Yates soon leaves as well in order to escape the theater-hating Philistine otherwise known as Sir Thomas. Sir Thomas says good riddance to all these people.", "analysis": ""}
