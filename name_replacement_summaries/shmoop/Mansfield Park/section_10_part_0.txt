Maria isn't so happy to hear this since she's supposed to marry Mr. Rushworth after her dad returns. She decides to ignore it since a lot can change in three months. Mary is intrigued by the return of Sir Thomas since it will shake things up. Edmund, Fanny, and Mary are in a group together once again and discuss Sir Thomas's return. Once he arrives, Maria will get married and Edmund will take orders in the church. A lot of change seems to be on the horizon. Mary once again hints that Edmund needs a new career plan pronto but Edmund insists that he wants to be a clergyman. The group then discusses other careers too. Mary suggests that Edmund is only joining the church because his dad has a living set aside for him, which Edmund denies. Fanny defends Edmund's career decision and the group then compares the navy and the army with the church. Mary says that the army and the navy are appropriately manly jobs. The church is lame. Mary and Edmund once again debate the politics of the church, Mary taking a more negative view and Edmund defending it. Mary offers up Dr. Grant as an example of how the clergy isn't the best job. Dr. Grant is fairly lazy and selfish. Fanny pipes up and defends the church and says that Dr. Grant is probably better for being a clergyman than if he had a different job that may have made him even more selfish. Mary compliments Fanny and then walks off. Edmund rambles on about how super Mary is. Fanny agrees and then quickly starts talking about what a pretty night it is and how great nature is. Edmund agrees and says it's a good thing she's been well educated into having good taste and appreciating nature. Since he did most of the educating, he's basically patting himself on the back here. Edmund than wanders off and leaves Fanny alone at the window.", "analysis": ""}
