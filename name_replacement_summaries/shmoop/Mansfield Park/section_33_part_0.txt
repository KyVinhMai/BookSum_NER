He quickly gets caught up on the stuff with Henry and he fully approves of the match. However, Edmund thinks that Henry went about this the wrong way and shouldn't have sprung his proposal on Fanny. Fanny has to be slowly eased into things, like a reluctant swimmer dipping her toes in the water before jumping in. Henry just tried to toss Fanny into the deep end of the pool, so to speak. Henry comes back to woo Fanny some more. He tries to impress her by reading some Shakespeare aloud. He and Edmund discuss plays and the art of reading aloud and oration, or public speaking. Lady Bertram is impressed, however, and says that Henry is a rather good actor. Even Fanny is interested when Henry is reading aloud but tries to ignore him for the sake of keeping up her stance. Lady Bertram asks if Henry will ever do any theater at his house and Henry says no quite loudly since Fanny definitely wouldn't like him to come over. Edmund and Henry discuss public speaking and sermons, but this just makes Fanny disapprove of Henry more as he makes light of sermons and the like. Henry notices his love is frowning and pesters her until she finally tells him that he's not serious or steady enough for her taste. Henry finally understands what her problem is and tells her that he'll prove to her that he really can be constant and responsible. He insists that he loves her and that he'll prove himself worthy of marrying her. Fanny is still miserable since Henry just won't quit.", "analysis": ""}
