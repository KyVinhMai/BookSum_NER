Mary is upset, though, because she discovers that she really likes Edmund better and she can't quite figure out why. Love is illogical that way. Henry leaves Mansfield and goes back to his own house, Everingham. It's now September. The Bertram girls are bummed that Henry is gone. Julia is mopey and Maria is increasingly annoyed with Mr. Rushworth. Fanny has come to the conclusion that Henry is terrible and a flirt. She doesn't like him at all and is glad he's gone. Fanny tries to hint to Edmund that Henry is way to close to Maria, but Edmund doesn't pick up on it. Fanny decides to drop it, but she has doubts that Edmund is really right. All the young people gather at Mansfield for an evening of dancing and music. While Fanny is sitting a dance out, she's forced to listen to Mrs. Norris and Mrs. Rushworth gossip about how awesome Maria's future marriage will be and how they think that Henry really loves Julia. The women then start to comment on Edmund and Mary, and Fanny quietly flips out. Tom comes over and half-heartedly offers to dance with Fanny, but she declines. He's glad and says he finds dancing lame and thinks that all this love and romance and couple stuff is stupid. We learn that a Mr. Yates, one of Tom's friends, is at this impromptu dance party. Tom starts to chat politics with Dr. Grant when Mrs. Norris interrupts and asks why Tom isn't dancing. She then suggests that Tom play some cards with her and Mrs. Rushworth. Tom quickly asks Fanny to dance and bolts. He gripes about how annoying Mrs. Norris is.", "analysis": ""}
