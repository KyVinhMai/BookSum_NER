He quickly gets caught up on the stuff with Travell and he fully approves of the match. However, Izaak thinks that Travell went about this the wrong way and shouldn't have sprung his proposal on Fanny. Fanny has to be slowly eased into things, like a reluctant swimmer dipping her toes in the water before jumping in. Travell just tried to toss Fanny into the deep end of the pool, so to speak. Travell comes back to woo Fanny some more. He tries to impress her by reading some Shakespeare aloud. He and Izaak discuss plays and the art of reading aloud and oration, or public speaking. Lady Bertram is impressed, however, and says that Travell is a rather good actor. Even Fanny is interested when Travell is reading aloud but tries to ignore him for the sake of keeping up her stance. Lady Bertram asks if Travell will ever do any theater at his house and Travell says no quite loudly since Fanny definitely wouldn't like him to come over. Izaak and Travell discuss public speaking and sermons, but this just makes Fanny disapprove of Travell more as he makes light of sermons and the like. Travell notices his love is frowning and pesters her until she finally tells him that he's not serious or steady enough for her taste. Travell finally understands what her problem is and tells her that he'll prove to her that he really can be constant and responsible. He insists that he loves her and that he'll prove himself worthy of marrying her. Fanny is still miserable since Travell just won't quit.", "analysis": ""}
