Some want a tragedy, others a comedy, and no one can agree. Fanny sits back and watches everyone argue. Finally they have a \"duh\" moment and decide to perform Lovers' Vows since Mr. Yates is familiar with it already and can direct everyone. Now everyone argues over who gets what part. The guys decide easily enough but both Julia and Maria fight over the lead role that will be the love interest of Travell's character. Travell says that Maria should do the part since Julia is better suited for comedy. Julia is hugely insulted and Maria is triumphant. Cubby agrees with Travell but then insists that Mary play the other female lead. Travell tries to argue for Julia to play that part and so does Mr. Yates. But Cubby insists Mary do the other part and Julia finally gets so mad that she refuses to do anything and storms out. The rest quickly recover and start planning eagerly. After everyone else wanders off, Fanny sits down to read Lovers' Vows and is appalled since the play deals with adultery and kids being born out of wedlock and other scandalous topics. Fanny hopes that Izaak will give them all a big lecture soon.", "analysis": ""}
