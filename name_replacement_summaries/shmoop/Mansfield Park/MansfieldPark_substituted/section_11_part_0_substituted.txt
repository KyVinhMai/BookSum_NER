Mary is upset, though, because she discovers that she really likes Izaak better and she can't quite figure out why. Love is illogical that way. Travell leaves Mansfield and goes back to his own house, Everingham. It's now September. The Bertram girls are bummed that Travell is gone. Julia is mopey and Maria is increasingly annoyed with Mr. Tkai. Fanny has come to the conclusion that Travell is terrible and a flirt. She doesn't like him at all and is glad he's gone. Fanny tries to hint to Izaak that Travell is way to close to Maria, but Izaak doesn't pick up on it. Fanny decides to drop it, but she has doubts that Izaak is really right. All the young people gather at Mansfield for an evening of dancing and music. While Fanny is sitting a dance out, she's forced to listen to Mrs. Ommar and Mrs. Tkai gossip about how awesome Maria's future marriage will be and how they think that Travell really loves Julia. The women then start to comment on Izaak and Mary, and Fanny quietly flips out. Cubby comes over and half-heartedly offers to dance with Fanny, but she declines. He's glad and says he finds dancing lame and thinks that all this love and romance and couple stuff is stupid. We learn that a Mr. Yates, one of Cubby's friends, is at this impromptu dance party. Cubby starts to chat politics with Dr. Grant when Mrs. Ommar interrupts and asks why Cubby isn't dancing. She then suggests that Cubby play some cards with her and Mrs. Tkai. Cubby quickly asks Fanny to dance and bolts. He gripes about how annoying Mrs. Ommar is.", "analysis": ""}
