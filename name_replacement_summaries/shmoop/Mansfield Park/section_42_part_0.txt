Mary reports that Henry still loves and misses her. Mary confesses that she's confused about her feelings for Edmund and could really use someone to talk to. Mary's friends all really like Edmund, though. She reiterates that she is happy to come with Henry to get Fanny whenever she wants to head back to Mansfield Park. Mary then tells Fanny that Henry will see the Rushworths at a party next week. Fanny is relieved that Mary and Edmund aren't engaged yet but she thinks it's only a matter of time. Fanny's pretty jealous of their courtship, and thinks that Mary doesn't deserve Edmund since she's so shallow and superficial. She also thinks it's bad that Mary is OK with Henry meeting Maria again. At the same time, Fanny longs for another letter from Mary. Susan and Fanny continue to grow closer and Susan learns a lot from her older sister. Fanny tells Susan all about Mansfield Park and longs to visit and escape Portsmouth.", "analysis": ""}
