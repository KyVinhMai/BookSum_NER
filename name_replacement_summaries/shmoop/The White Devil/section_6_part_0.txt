{"name": "Act 3, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210613134721/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-white-devil/summary/act-3-scene-3", "summary": "Flamineo, Marcello, and Lodovico enter. Distracted and pretending to be mad, Flamineo talks to himself. He talks about human suffering, and pretends to regret serving Brachiano. The Savoy Ambassador enters and tries to comfort him, but Flamineo says it means nothing. He argues with the French Ambassador, who thinks that Vittoria's guilt was proved. Flamineo accuses him of being bribed and corrupted. He laments that religion gets mixed up in politics, and says he wishes he was Jewish. Marcello, being an Anti-Semite, says there are too many Jews. Flamineo says there are not enough--proved by the fact that so many Christians needed to become usurers . He exits, and Lodovico says, in an aside, that he knows Flamineo was Brachiano's henchman and wants to wind him up. Flamineo re-enters. Flamineo criticizes Lodovico for returning to Rome without being pardoned--he's still officially banished. He and Lodovico exchange colorful curses. Lodovico tells Flamineo of Isabella's death, and Flamineo pretends to grieve. He and Lodovico talk about joining together in mourning and melancholia, and pledge to live unkempt, lice-infected lives of grief. Sounds...fun? Antonelli and Gasparo enter and tell Lodovico that the Pope, on his deathbed, has officially pardoned Lodovico. Lodovico ditches the silly mourning plan, explaining he was joking around. Flamineo says he's going back on his word and Lodovico calls Vittoria a \"damnable whore.\" Lodovico laughs at Flamineo, who hits him. Marcello gets mad at Lodovico. He and Flamineo leave. Lodovico regrets that he didn't murder Flamineo, and says he's going to go drink some wine.", "analysis": ""}
