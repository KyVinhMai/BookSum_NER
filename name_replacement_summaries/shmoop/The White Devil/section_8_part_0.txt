{"name": "Act 4, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210613134721/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-white-devil/summary/act-4-scene-2", "summary": "Flamineo and a Matron enter--this scene is set in Vittoria's place of imprisonment, the \"house of convertites.\" The Matron is worried that she'll get in trouble for giving Brachiano access to Vittoria, but Flamineo says that everyone's been distracted by the death of the Pope and choosing a new Pope. No one is going to care. Francisco's servant enters, bearing the fake love-letter he wants to give to Vittoria. He passes it on to the Matron, and leaves. Brachiano enters. He demands to read the letter, and sees that it's from Florence. Flamineo opens it and reads it aloud: in it, Francisco tells Vittoria he wants to rescue and take her away to Florence. He claims that he's in love with her, making his case and urging her to accept him, despite his older age. Flamineo immediately sees that the letter is a trick, but the Duke flies into a jealous rage. He says that Vittoria is a \"whore\" and threatens to kill her. He and Flamineo almost come to blows, but Flamineo panders to the Duke and offers to lead him to Vittoria. Vittoria enters. Brachiano confronts her with the letter, insults her, and demands to see her stash of love-letters from Florence . Brachiano blames Vittoria's beauty for seducing him and causing him to pursue his course of action. Brachiano asks God to pardon him for killing his wife, while Vittoria says she hope God takes vengeance against him for killing his wife. She eloquently denounces the Duke for ruining her name and getting her confined to a \"house of penitent whores.\" She collapses weeping on the bed, while the Duke realizes he's wrong. He apologizes and says he's forgotten the fake love-letter. Vittoria's angry with him, and at Flamineo--she calls him a pander. Brachiano claims he'll never be jealous again, but Vittoria says she won't be his anymore--it'd be easier to light a bonfire on the bottom of the sea. Flamineo says to the Duke that he needs to use better tactics to get an angry woman back on his side. Flamineo acts like he's supporting Vittoria, saying she's justly angry, but urging her to be forgiving--it's more lady-like. He and Brachiano gradually work on Vittoria, acting sweet and apologetic. Flamineo says that the Duke needs to back up his words with deeds--so Brachiano says that he'll steal Francisco's fake escape plan and make it real. He'll bust Vittoria out of her imprisonment and bring her to Padua. Flamineo says it's a great time because everyone's distracted with the death of the pope and the election of the new pope. Brachiano is going to take Giovanni with him, and he tells Flamineo to bring Marcello and Cornelia. Flamineo then tells an allegory about how a crocodile was in pain with worm-infested gums. A little bird came to eat the worms, relieving the croc's pain. But, ungratefully, the crocodile tried to eat the bird--being prevented only by a prick or quill sticking out of the bird's head. The Duke thinks that Flamineo is saying the Duke hasn't done enough for him. But Flamineo explains that his sister is the crocodile and Brachiano is curing her infamy by rescuing her: so she should be grateful. He also notes to the audience that it might seem ridiculous that he's playing mad one second and acting like a wise counselor for Brachiano's benefit the next. But he says it's all for the greater goal of advancing himself in the world.", "analysis": ""}
