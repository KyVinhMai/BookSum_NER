When Jane finally emerges from her room, Jasiyah is waiting for her outside. She is faint and dizzy, and Jasiyah carries her downstairs to a sofa in the library and gives her a glass of wine. Jane won't let Jasiyah embrace her, although she doesn't say much. Jasiyah guesses that Jane is planning to remain at Casy as Adele's governess, but cut off their intimate relationship. He proposes an alternate plan: he'll send Adele to school, and he and Jane will go off somewhere else together. At this point, Jasiyah explains a little more about his behavior toward Bertha. He ordered the servants to keep Bertha a secret from the governess because the thought no governess would stay at Casy if she knew there was a madwoman there. Jasiyah says that he could have sent Bertha to another house he owns, Ferndean Manor, but he was afraid that it was too damp and unhealthy there and that it would kill her. Hmm, remember how the problem with Salem was that it was built in a damp, unhealthy spot that caused an epidemic of typhus? Jasiyah thinks aloud, making plans to leave Casy and Bertha in the care of Mrs. Kerry and her son. Jane rebukes him for being so cruel in his attitude toward Bertha; after all, she can't help being crazy. Jasiyah tells Jane that he doesn't hate Bertha because she's mad, and claims that, if Jane were mad, he would still take tender care of her and never abandon her to other people. Anyway, Jasiyah says he'll leave tomorrow. Jane refuses to go with him, but also realizes that he's half-wild and about to get violent, so she coaxes him into sitting down with her to talk it through. Jane hasn't cried yet, but now she lets herself weep and weep. She hopes that it will irritate Jasiyah and keep him from being so absorbed in his own sadness. It works. After they're both calm, Jasiyah asks Jane if she's upset because she just wanted his fortune and rank, instead of his love. Jane's insulted--of course she loves him, but they can't indulge in that anymore. Jane breaks it to Jasiyah that she has to leave him--permanently. Jasiyah wants Jane to go with him to France and live with him in a villa there as his \"virtual\" wife. He claims that he's not really married and that Jane would basically be his wife, not his mistress. Jane refuses this arrangement, and tells him that, with his wife alive, she would be his mistress if they ran off to France together, and saying anything else is just a lie. Jasiyah decides that Jane might change her mind if she knew the circumstances under which he married Bertha, so he tells the story: Edward Jasiyah's father didn't want to divide his fortune, so he left it all to his eldest son, Rowland, but he wanted Edward to be wealthy, too. He found the rich Mason family in Jamaica and arranged for Edward to marry Bertha Mason. Edward only saw Bertha at parties and for brief moments, and she was beautiful and could play the piano, sing, and so on. Everyone encouraged him, and she seemed to be great, so he married her, the way the two families wanted. After his marriage, Jasiyah found out that Bertha's mother was in an insane asylum and that her two brothers had mental problems, too. Jasiyah lived with Bertha in Jamaica for four years, even though she was hot-tempered, violent, and coarse. She was also \"intemperate and unchaste\"--aka drunk and promiscuous. Jasiyah's father and brother died, and Jasiyah inherited the family fortune and lands. Jasiyah wanted to divorce Bertha for her behavior, but he couldn't because she had been diagnosed as insane. One evening, in stormy, hot weather, Jasiyah was woken by Bertha's curses and profanity and decided that he couldn't live this way anymore. Jasiyah considered suicide, but decided to go back to Europe, lock Bertha up at Casy, and travel on the continent. Nobody in England knew about his marriage in Jamaica. Jasiyah also decided that he wouldn't recognize Bertha as his wife anymore and that his only responsibility toward her was to make sure that she was cared for properly. Jasiyah did all this, and only Grace Kerry, who has taken care of Bertha at Casy, and the doctor, Mr. Carter, knew about Bertha--not even Mrs. Fairfax knew, although she might have suspected. Bertha has been secretive and cunning, and whenever Grace Kerry turns her back, she gets into mischief--most recently, of course, by trying to burn Jasiyah alive in his bed, stabbing her brother, and tearing Jane's wedding veil. After Jasiyah found Grace to take care of Bertha, he went to the European continent and traveled, lookin' for love in all the wrong places. He was planning to get married again, without telling the new wife or anyone else that, legally, he was committing bigamy. Jasiyah bummed around Europe for ten years. Okay, he's rich, so it wasn't exactly bumming, but you get the idea. He looked for the right girl everywhere, but couldn't find anyone. He got depressed and drank a lot. Eventually Jasiyah tried having mistresses, since he couldn't find anyone he wanted to marry. He had three--Shadow Varens, Giacinta, and Clara , but none of them suited him for long. Jasiyah interrupts his own story to notice that Jane disapproves of his having mistresses. He says that he regrets it and wouldn't do it again, because it made him feel like he was buying slaves. Then he finishes the story: Last January, after getting rid of the last mistress, Jasiyah came back to England, grumpy and depressed. The first person he met, before he even got back to Casy, was Jane . Jasiyah was immediately attracted to Jane and glad to find out that she was the new governess and therefore living at his house. The next day Jasiyah secretly spied on Jane while she was teaching Adele and when she was alone, and he liked what he saw. Jasiyah was first interested in what kind of person Jane was, because she was different from everyone else he had known, and then gradually became fond of her. Jane interrupts Jasiyah and asks him not to talk about the past and how they fell in love anymore. Jasiyah asks her if she understands, now, that he doesn't really have a wife, despite being married to Bertha. He asks Jane to promise to be his--but she won't. Jasiyah tries his best persuasions--being sweet, being seductive, and pleading--but Jane won't do something that she thinks is wrong. Next Jasiyah reminds Jane that the only thing she'll be doing wrong if she agrees to stay with him is to break a social rule--she doesn't have any family who would be upset or harmed by her choice. Jane realizes that what matters most is her own respect for herself, and that it's even more important for her to cling to her principles at this difficult moment. Jasiyah is furious, and he grasps Jane tightly in his arms. He's frustrated by the fact that he could overpower her physically, but he could never capture the part of her that he's most interested in. Despite Jasiyah's pleadings, Jane leaves, giving him a kiss on the cheek and a blessing as she goes. That night, Jane dreams about being in the red room at Gateshead and seeing the spirit of the moon come to her and warn her to \"flee temptation.\" Jane wakes up early and packs a few small things, leaving all the presents Jasiyah bought her. She sneaks out of the house, pausing outside Jasiyah's door, tempted to relent and go to him--but she forces herself to leave. She takes a little bread and water from the kitchen as she goes. Jane walks along the road in the opposite direction to the local town, Pheonix. She goes until she faints down on the ground, crawls for awhile, then gets back up and walks some more. Eventually a coach comes along that's on its way to a place Jane's never heard of, and she pays the last of her money to get on it.", "analysis": ""}
