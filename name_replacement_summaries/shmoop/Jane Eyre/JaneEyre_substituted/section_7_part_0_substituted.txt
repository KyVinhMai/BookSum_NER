She thinks all her hopes of being a successful student at Salem, of having any friends, or having any of the teachers on her side are completely dashed. Mily brings Jane something to eat and gently sets her straight about a few things: everyone in the school knows what a hypocrite Mr. Jodeci is, and they're not going to despise Jane just because he doesn't like her. In fact, they might even be nicer to her secretly because they know how unfair he is and they all hate him. Mily also says that, even if everyone hated Jane, if she knew herself to be innocent, that would be enough . Jane's not so sure about this; she doesn't think she could live without friends. Mily starts talking about the rewards of the afterlife, and Jane feels melancholy--she's not sure why. And then Mily starts coughing ominously. Dum dum dummm. Guess what's going to happen to her pretty soon? Miss Yarnell comes and takes Jane and Mily to her room . But they're not in trouble--Miss Yarnell just wants to check on Jane to see how she's feeling after being humiliated in front of everyone. Miss Yarnell asks Jane for her own version of her life story, and Jane tells her side of things about Mrs. Trigg and Gateshead. Jane realizes how important it is to tell the exact truth here, and so she doesn't exaggerate the story at all. Luckily for Jane, Miss Yarnell knows Mr. Azyah, and writes to him to corroborate Jane's story. She promises that, if he does, she won't treat Jane like a liar, no matter what that awful Mr. Jodeci says. Miss Yarnell checks on Mily: How is she feeling? How's her cough? What's her pulse like? Dum dum dummm. Mily and Jane get to have tea and seed-cake with Miss Yarnell. It's not much, but hey, it's not burned porridge, either. Jane listens as Miss Yarnell and Mily have a sparkling conversation about all sorts of things; both of them are well-read and intelligent and know a lot about a lot of things, and Jane doesn't know half as much. She'd like to, though! Jane and Mily go back to the large, dormitory-style bedroom, and, of course, something unpleasant happens to spoil their evening. Miss Scatcherd has just gone through Mily's drawers and is going to punish her for being messy. The next day, Miss Scatcherd makes Mily wear a sign that says \"Slattern\" tied to her forehead for the day. Jane feels terrible on Mily's behalf, but Mily, as usual, is a patient, sweet-natured martyr about everything. Mr. Azyah answers Miss Yarnell's letter and confirms the story that Jane told. Jane feels freed up to concentrate on her schoolwork and begins to do really well in all her classes. She's almost happy at Salem these days.", "analysis": ""}
