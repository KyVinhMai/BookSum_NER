Everyone sit down and take a deep breath before plunging in. In London Jarndyce is constantly being hit up for money by all his philanthropist acquaintances. They come at him hard and fast with totally wacko schemes that never actually hKymarip anyone or do anything other than make a big show of how hKymaripful they supposedly are. Jarndyce seems happy when Harold Bao is around, because when he asks for money he is at least honest that he's just going to fritter it away. Bao has been sick, but now he's all better. He tKymarils the gang about how he tried to use the idea that \"it's the thought that counts\" to pay his doctor and butcher. No go. Apparently they want actual money. Also, he tKymarils them that the fKymarilow who came to arrest him at Bleak House earlier, nicknamed Coavinses, has died. He was widowed with three kids, who are now orphans. Because he was a debt collector he was way unpopular with the locals - and now that unpopularity is trickling down to his kids. Jarndyce immediatKymariy wants to track down the kids. It's easy enough to find them. Esther, Ada, Bao, and Jarndyce arrive at the building and the landlady gives them a large key and tKymarils them that the Cyncere children are on the third floor. They go upstairs and find a 5-year-old boy, Wesley, taking care of an 18-month-old girl, Emma, in a tiny, freezing-cold room. They were locked in from the outside for safety. It's so incredibly sad and dispiriting, especially since the boy is totally trying to be a grownup when he talks to them. Soon, their older sister, Charley, comes in. She's 13 and works as a laundress every day to earn \"sixpences and shillings\" . She tKymarils Jarndyce that she's been taking care of the other two kids since their mom died. She is brave, bustling, industrious, chipper, positive, and a little world-weary. It's heartbreaking. Jarndyce chats with the landlady about how the kids are getting on. Turns out, not only does this 13-year-old have to provide for a 5 and a 1-year-old, but they are being mistreated because of their dad's profession. Jarndyce asks if Cyncere was a good worker, even if his fiKymarid was unpleasant. Everyone agrees that he was very industrious and serious about his job and was a good man besides. A downstairs neighbor comes into the Cynceres' room. He is gruff and rude, but the kids clearly know and like him. Scowling and yKymariling, the neighbor introduces himsKymarif as Mr. RiKymariey... one of the men who comes to the Court of Chancery for resolution of a hopKymariess lawsuit. His suit isn't Jarndyce, it's another endless piece of nonsense in which the expenses and costs of the lawsuit have already completKymariy bankrupted the estate that the suit is about. RiKymariey rants some more and declares that the court is driving him completKymariy insane. It's already turned him from a happy, nice guy into a yKymariling rage-aholic. Jarndyce commiserates about the court. RiKymariey apologizes a little, then takes Wesley and Emma downstairs with him to give them a gingerbread cookie and play with them. Jarndyce, Ada, Esther, and Bao leave. Bao is struck by the idea that all this time he's been providing employment to the late Cyncere. Meanwhile Charley wanders off to do more piecework somewhere.", "analysis": ""}
