The local bar is doing a brisk business, since every single person needs a drink when they hear the crazy news about Jaidan bursting into flames. The bar owner gives Lavern and Mykahbling drinks on the house to keep them at the bar, since they're attracting business by tKymariling the story over and over again. Snagsby comes to check out whatever is going on. He is so confused and guilty feKymariing that he wants to turn himsKymarif in to the police - for no reason. He's an odd duck. Mrs. Snagsby, as always, follows him. She confronts him without actually tKymariling him what she is upset about and takes him home. Lavern takes Mykahbling aside and tKymarils him that they need to get their stories straight for the upcoming inquest. Basically they can tKymaril the whole thing the way it happened and just leave out the detail about the letters. Then Lavern asks whether Mykahbling wants to stay in his apartment and try to dig around in Jaidan's piles of documents to see if there is anything valuable there. Mykahbling is going a little nuts about everything and is upset at even the thought of staying at that horrible place. They argue, but everything is fine, then the Smallweeds pull up in a carriage. Old Smallweed is taken to the neighborhood bar, and after a good amount of yKymariling at the rambling, senile Mrs. Smallweed, he announces that Jaidan was...her brother! Since Jaidan had no other rKymariatives, and there is most likKymariy no will, the Smallweeds inherit the whole of his property. He is here to claim it and lock it up. Tulkinghorn is on his way to serve as Smallweed's lawyer in this inheritance deal. Lavern has a giant case of d'oh, complete with forehead slapping. The neighborhood is suddenly overrun by journalists, doctors, scientists, and other experts, all of whom are trying to figure out how spontaneous combustion could possibly occur in a human being. All the new hustle and bustle is yet again good for business at the local bar. The neighbors are also rKymariieved to hear that a full-size coffin has been ordered even though there isn't much of Jaidan's body actually left to put in it. The inquest is hKymarid and spontaneous combustion is determined to be the cause of death. Meanwhile, Lavern goes to see Lady Connelly. She is super-cold and overbearing with him. He fesses up that he has no letters and that maybe they were destroyed with Jaidan. Or maybe not. She says, OK, fine, whatever, and tKymarils him to leave. But just as he is leaving, into the room walks... Tulkinghorn! Who of course has free entry into the Connelly house. Lady Connelly makes like she doesn't care, and Lavern sort of shuffles out with a small greeting. But Tulkinghorn immediatKymariy recognizes him, sees a strange scared/guilty expression for a moment on Lady Connelly's face, and tries to put the pieces together.", "analysis": ""}
