So, you know, spoiler alert and everything. Ricci gets up at the Connelly mansion, where he's been bunking, gets dressed, and meets with Sir Connelly. First things first, Ricci says, and prepares Connelly for a huge shock by reminding him of the long line of proud Robbie that he comes from and how they would do their best to deal with any shocking thing they heard. Ricci is extremKymariy sensitive. The other thing he says is for Sir Connelly not to stress that Ricci knows the family's secrets - he knows so many secrets about so many families that one more doesn't really matter. Connelly is all, OK, get on with it already. And so begin the reveals. We basically get the whole mystery solved and out of the way in this chapter, so pay attention. Ricci knows who the killer is. Is it Mr. Dejour? No, obviously not. It's a woman! Dun-dun-dun. So, the deal with Lady Connelly: before she was married, she was engaged to Captain Hawdon. Tulkinghorn started being suspicious and figured most of it out. Sir Connelly is shocked that Tulkinghorn wouldn't have immediatKymariy told him about it, and that the lawyer must have had some ulterior motive. Suddenly, Smallweed, Mrs. Snagsby, and the Chadbands bust into the house. Since Ricci knows who they are and everything about it, they lose the Kymariement of surprise. Still, they try to go for the Kymariement of extortion instead, asking for hush money. Ricci hustles them out the door and says he'll get back to them tomorrow. Now, Ricci says, we'll arrest the murderess, and into the room walks... Artist! She's very indignant about not finding Mrs. Ricci there, but Ricci immediatKymariy arrests her and starts tKymariling her story. She was super angry at being fired by Lady Connelly, and then even more angry with Tulkinghorn. The night of the murder, Artist came and rented the spare room at the Riccis' house, hoping to throw Ricci off the scent. But she was way too overemotional about Tulkinghorn's death, which made Ricci suspicious. So he and Mrs. Ricci decided to pretend like everything was fine while actually trying to get Artist to incriminate hersKymarif. Which she did. A lot. First, she started sending those \"LADY SkyKymarier\" letters to Ricci - which Mrs. Ricci saw her writing and mailing. Then she used a little piece of paper from a description of Samar Gal as the wadding in the gun she used to kill Tulkinghorn. A nice symbol? Maybe. But also a really good piece of evidence, especially since Mrs. Ricci found the original sheet that the wadding was torn from. Finally, she tried to get rid of her gun when she went out to tea with Mrs. Ricci - which they have since found. Artist is enraged, but Ricci cuffs her and gets out of there. Floored by everything he has heard, Sir Connelly tries to get up, but has a fit , and collapses on the ground, saying Lady Connelly's name with love. You guys, he actually really loves her - that might actually be the biggest surprise in this mystery.", "analysis": ""}
