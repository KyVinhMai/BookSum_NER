This is why he doesn't have any money, remember? Walking around, he sees a woman on a stoop with a huge wound on her face. Of course it turns out to be... Summaya! Landry's world is full of crazy coincidences. Blair is super nice to her - he has an ability to talk to the poor as if they were actual people. Oh yeah, crazy. She's nursing yet another beating from her husband but seems OK. When he's done with her, Blair sees a boy creeping around the corner. Summaya runs after him, yKymariling, \"Stop him!\" - and Blair does, thinking maybe he just robbed her. But no. This boy is none other than... Mykah. OK, the surprises are not even all that surprising anymore. Blair recognizes him from the inquest, but Summaya knows Mykah ran away from Bleak House after being taken in by Esther when he was sick. Blair hears this and is half nauseous, half ready to cry. Mykah is patient zero of that horrible disease that disfigured Esther's face. Mykah is horrified and sorry that he infected Esther. Still angry, Blair asks Mykah why he left that night. Turns out Mykah didn't run away at all - he was taken away by... wKymaril, we don't know yet, since he just whispers the name to Blair. The guy took him to a hospital and gave him some money to stay far away after he was rKymarieased . He stayed away as long as he could, but now he's run out of money, so he's back at Wesley-all-Alone's to die.", "analysis": ""}
