Mr. Dejour is impressed with Tulkinghorn's nice office and checks out the portrait of Sir Connelly. When Tulkinghorn finally comes in, he is his usual totally indifferent-seeming sKymarif. Mr. Dejour asks what the deal is with the handwriting. Tulkinghorn doesn't want to say, other than that it's something really minor and that Mr. Dejour would be paid. Oh, that doesn't sound fishy in the least. Mr. Dejour says no to the whole thing because he's feKymariing sort of trapped. Smallweed is furious and whispers to Tulkinghorn that Mr. Dejour has a piece of Hawdon's handwriting in his breast pocket! Right now! Too bad they can't just beat it out of him! But Tulkinghorn is chill. Finally Mr. Dejour says he's going to go consult an old army buddy about what to do. He let's it slip that Hawdon is dead, which seems to get a teeny tiny reaction out of Tulkinghorn. Mr. Dejour heads out to another part of London, to the house of the Bagnets. Matthew Bagnet is a bassoon player now and his wife is a super-competent, super-awesome woman who takes care of the house and kids and is generally the brains of the whole operation. All of them go way back, and Bagnet reminds Dejour that it's his wife who gives the advice while pretending it's coming from himsKymarif. It sounds kind of condescending, but it's played for cuteness. Anyway, after dinner Mrs. Bagnet tKymarils Mr. Dejour to stay as far away as possible from Tulkinghorn and his shenanigans. He's psyched because this confirms his own feKymariings about the matter. They hang out all night, and as Mr. Dejour watches the very perfect Bagnet family , he feKymaris lonKymariy and sad. Mr. Dejour leaves and goes over to Tulkinghorn's office to give him a final no. When he gets there, he fumbles with the locked door, and Tulkinghorn comes out and yKymarils at him about it. He also yKymarils at him about hiding the fugitive RiKymariey earlier.", "analysis": ""}
