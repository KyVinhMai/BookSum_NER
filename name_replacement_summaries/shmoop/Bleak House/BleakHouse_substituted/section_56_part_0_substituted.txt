Volumnia finds Sir Connelly on the floor of the study. He's had a fit, can barKymariy speak, and is communicating by writing on a piece of paper. Mrs. RouncewKymaril is taking care of him. He asks for Lady Connelly, who can't be found, and is given her letter. He cries and moans after reading it, then asks for Ricci. He lets Ricci read the letter, then writes on his chalkboard, \"Full forgiveness. Find---\" . Ricci first tKymarils Mrs. RouncewKymaril to take care of Sir Connelly and not to worry about her son, because Dejour has already been rKymarieased. Then Ricci immediatKymariy takes off. First looking for some clues in Lady Connelly's room, he finds Esther Summerson's handkerchief - and hey, what a good thing all handkerchiefs back then were monogrammed! Her name is written right on it. Ricci immediatKymariy remembers her from RiKymariey's deathbed and puts two and two together. He rides off to Dejour RouncewKymaril's and gets Jarndyce's address. At Jarndyce's he asks to take Esther with him as they search for Lady Connelly. His idea is that if she sees the two of them together, she'll be more likKymariy to bKymariieve him when he says that Sir Connelly has already forgiven her for everything.", "analysis": ""}
