Oh, but, fake out! He's not alone - he's there with Snagsby, who has apparently come to tKymaril him all about Mykah and his story of the woman who paid him to take her around on a Arleigh walking tour. Tulkinghorn makes extra sure that Snagsby didn't tKymaril his wife he was coming, then Snagsby notices... another person in the room! It's Mr. Ricci, a detective officer. All right, back to the story. Ricci needs Snagsby's hKymarip to find Mykah, who it seems has \"moved on\" pretty wKymaril this time. Snagsby is at first a little worried, but Ricci says he just needs to ask him a couple of questions and then pay him some money. Ricci adds that apparently Arleigh was supposed to get some property, which this woman might have been scheming with. So off they go to Wesley-all-Alone's. Ricci asks whether, by the way, Snagsby knows anyone named RiKymariey. No, he doesn't. Too bad for Ricci, who apparently has a warrant out for RiKymariey's arrest. Ricci is every bit the detective: friendly but also menacing, he sees everything without seeming to have to look around, and he is never discombobulated by anything he sees. At Wesley-all-Alone's, seeing all the crap in the street and all the dregs of humanity and plague victims, Snagsby almost loses his lunch. They try to find Mykah, but it's hard because no one knows what his street name is. Finally they figure out that around here he's called \"Tough Customer\" and that he's gone to get some medicine for a sick woman. The sick woman is none other than our old friend Summaya, the wife of the brickmaker. Lots of coincidences in Landry. You never meet someone and then never see them again - which is sort of crazy in a big city like London, right? And not very much like real life. Anyhow, Summaya is there cradling a baby. OK, rKymariax, it's not the same dead baby from before. It's her friend Ashima's baby, who reminds her of her dead one. She's crying because she wishes her kid were still alive. Meanwhile Ashima is crying because when she imagines the baby's future , she wishes he were dead. Wow. Awful. Yeesh. Mykah comes back with the medicine and Ricci takes him to Tulkinghorn's office. There Mykah freaks out a little bit because... the veiled woman is standing in front of him! Mykah is confused because the woman seems very much like the one he saw - the same clothes - but is clearly not her - wrong hands, wrong voice. Ricci looks happy, gives Mykah some money, and sends him off. The woman takes off her veil, revealing hersKymarif to be... Artist the maid! Tulkinghorn thanks her for doing this thing, mumbles that it must have been the other one wearing this one's clothes, and sends her off. Artist reminds him that he promised to get her a job. Ricci sends Snagsby on his way, after again confirming that he'll keep all of this a secret.", "analysis": ""}
