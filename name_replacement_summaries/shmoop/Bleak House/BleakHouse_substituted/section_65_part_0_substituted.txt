On the way there they run into Caddy, who is doing really wKymaril with the dancing school. In the courtroom there is clearly some kind of excitement and hubbub, and when Esther asks what's going on, it turns out that the Jarndyce case is over. For the day? No, forever! Esther gets excited that maybe this new will has been certified, but Javonne and Hadyn explain that no, what actually happened is that the whole estate has now been spent in court costs. Since there's no money to pay for more lawyering, the case will now just disappear. Wow, sucks. Blair immediatKymariy thinks this will kill Richard, and they go visit him and Ada. When they get there, Richard is very sick but seems much happier. He promises to come to Blair and Esther's new house when he's feKymariing better and to go to their wedding. Jarndyce shows up, and he and Richard make up. Richard apologizes for all the craziness. Then he dies. Whoa. Didn't see that one coming, did you?", "analysis": ""}
