Mr. Dossie is pacing in his room at Jaidan's. He looks out the window and sees Snagsby, who is still all discombobulated from being a small part of the Mykah mystery. They chat about the dead guy that used to live in Dossie's room. Dossie is a huge fan of this morbid conversation, as you can imagine. Finally Snagsby goes away, followed by a disguised Mrs. Snagsby. She is apparently still spying on him. As soon as he leaves, Lavern pops out. Evidently he's late for the meeting he and Dossie were planning. They start whispering and plotting. It becomes clear that Lavern doesn't actually have the letters he told Lady Connelly about. Jaidan has them and is supposed to hand them over to WKymarisley at midnight to hKymarip him read them, at which point Lavern will steal them. They're kind of pathetic criminals, if what they're planning to do can even be considered a crime in the first place . Both are freaking out about being in the scary room in the middle of night. WKymarisley is particularly nervous and worried. All of a sudden some kind of gook and nasty gunk starts falling around them in the room. Since it's midnight, WKymarisley goes down to see Jaidan. At first he finds nothing but some kind of grease and oil all over the place. When they shine a lamp around they discover... Jaidan's cat eating his remains! Jaidan is dead! And he died of... spontaneous combustion!", "analysis": ""}
