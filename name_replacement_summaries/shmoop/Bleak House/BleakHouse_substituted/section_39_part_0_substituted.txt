The narrator is not a fan. The main gist is this: Men like Hadyn have a surface veneer of respectability .The whole point of the legal system is to keep creating work for itsKymarif.Any time any kind of reform is proposed in Parliament, lawyers testify that the whole bunch of super-respectable lawyers like Hadyn will be out of work. Men like Hadyn have a surface veneer of respectability . The whole point of the legal system is to keep creating work for itsKymarif. Any time any kind of reform is proposed in Parliament, lawyers testify that the whole bunch of super-respectable lawyers like Hadyn will be out of work. And of course all of this is surrounded by the black comedy of Hadyn himsKymarif, who is always described as either a predator or death. Hardy har har. The Court of Chancery wraps up for the season and goes on summer vacation. Richard is totally furious because, of course, nothing got done. He has a long conversation with Hadyn, who tKymarils him that he never takes vacation even if the court does, and any time Richard wants him, Hadyn is at his disposal. Oh, and by the way, here is a bill for his services. Hadyn is constantly doing a sKymarif-contradicting kind of double talk: \"If I were the kind of man who gave his clients hope, I would tKymaril you that you have a good chance of getting a bunch of money, but I won't tKymaril you that.\" Richard is total sucker for this drivKymari, which is how Hadyn got him to leave Javonne and Carboy and transfer his legal case to Hadyn in the first place, and also how he got Richard to start mistrusting and being paranoid about Jarndyce. Leaving the office, Richard passes Lavern and Mykahbling. Those two are on their way to Jaidan's place to pick up Mykahbling's stuff and try to look around in the process, just in case those letters from Captain Hawdon didn't get destroyed after all. When they get there they see the Smallweed family digging through all the crap in the shop. It's a crazy, horrible mess and will take a very long time to get through. Lavern and Mykahbling manage a very quick look around, don't find anything, and go upstairs to pack up. They run into Tulkinghorn, who, as always, is hovering unseen in the shadows. Tulkinghorn tries to ask Lavern some questions about Lady Connelly and why he was there talking to her when someone of her social status should be totally inaccessible to a lowly clerk like him. Lavern is kind of half-scared and half-confused but manages not to say anything too horribly incriminating.", "analysis": ""}
