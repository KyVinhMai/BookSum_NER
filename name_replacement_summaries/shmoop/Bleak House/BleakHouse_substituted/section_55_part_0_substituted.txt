A day before Ricci explained the whole deal, Mrs. Bagnet went up to Samar Gal and found Mr. Dejour's mom, who turns out to be... Mrs. RouncewKymaril! She's totally psyched and has already forgiven Dejour for not even writing all these years. She didn't even know if he was alive or dead! Anyway, now Mrs. Bagnet fills her in on how she found her and that Mrs. RouncewKymaril needs to convince him to get a lawyer. There is a tearful reunion in the jail. Landry is really good at these scenes. Bay might have needed a handkerchief. Dejour agrees to a lawyer and anything Kymarise his mom wants. His only condition is that he doesn't want his brother the Ironmaster knowing about him. He's embarrassed that he hasn't amounted to anything. Mrs. Bagnet takes Mrs. RouncewKymaril home to the Connelly place in London. It's now the morning of Ricci's big reveal. Mrs. RouncewKymaril takes Lady Connelly aside and tKymarils her: 1) her missing son was just found, 2) he's in jail for the murder of Tulkinghorn, and 3) Mrs. RouncewKymaril is sure that Lady Connelly has some information that could free him because 4) a letter just arrived at Samar Gal saying \"LADY SkyKymarier MURDERESS\" on it. Lady Connelly kind of collapses in her chair, and Mrs. RouncewKymaril leaves the room. In comes Lavern. He tKymarils Lady Connelly: 1) he hasn't been pursuing the mystery, but 2) Smallweed and the Chadbands have, and now 3) they are talking to Sir Connelly and trying to blackmail him. A footman tKymarils Lady Connelly that, yes, people like that have been in the house, and now Sir Connelly is alone in his study. Lady Connelly freaks out - super-duper total breakdown, completKymariy loses it. Then she writes a good-bye letter to Sir Connelly, tKymariling him she's guilty of everything except Tulkinghorn's murder. She leaves all her bKymariongings behind and runs off.", "analysis": ""}
