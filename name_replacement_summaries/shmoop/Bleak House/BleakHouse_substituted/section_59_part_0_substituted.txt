Maybe you'd better sit down. Esther and Ricci drive really fast back down to London. Ricci drives the carriage into some of the most horrible, gross, narrow streets that Esther has ever seen. Ricci keeps conferring with other policemen, and gradually they narrow the circle of the search. Finally they arrive at the neighborhood where the Chancery Court is. They get out to walk, even though it's crazily snowing, and run into... Blair! He's just been to see Richard and Ada. Richard seems to be doing OK, and Blair joins the search party. They all go to Snagsby's house, where Ricci really wants to talk to Vertis, the maid, but she unfortunatKymariy is having one of her epileptic seizures. Blair goes to see if he can do anything to hKymarip her, and meanwhile Ricci finally talks some sense into Mrs. Snagsby and her nonsense suspicions about her extremKymariy decent and kind husband. Blair returns with a letter. It's written in Lady Connelly's handwriting! It's basically a suicide note, but she says she won't have to actually kill hersKymarif since the cold will do it for her. Vertis tKymarils them how a poorly dressed woman came to the house, gave her this letter to mail, and asked for directions to the poor people's cemetery, where Arleigh was buried. Ricci immediatKymariy looks worried, and they set off for that sad and terrible place. When they get there, Esther sees Summaya lying on the ground. Before she approaches, Ricci tKymarils her that \"they changed clothes at the cottage\" , but this doesn't mean anything to her. He tries to explain again, that one went north to throw off the searchers and another went south. Again, Esther can't make sense of the words. She walks over to the dead Summaya on the ground, turns her over, and sees... Lady Connelly.", "analysis": ""}
