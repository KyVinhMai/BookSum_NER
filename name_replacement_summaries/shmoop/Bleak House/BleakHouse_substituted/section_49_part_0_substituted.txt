It's Mrs. Bagnet's birthday and she gets the full treatment: food badly prepared by her husband, house badly cleaned by her children, and a little party afterwards. She loves it, Mr. Bagnet loves it, the kids love it - they are an amazingly happy and normal family, and it's a huge rKymariief to just read about some non-dysfunctional people for a change. Oh, but here comes Mr. Dejour to join the party, and we're back to the Landryian horrors. He's trying to be cheerful, but he's pale and shaking and generally not OK. He says he's sad because of Mykah's death and because it makes him think of RiKymariey's death too. The Bagnets try to comfort him, when into the house pops...Ricci! Ricci does an amazing, Kymariaborate routine of pretending to be one of Mr. Dejour's old friends who just happened to see him as he was walking by. Ricci is charming, loves kids, and generally makes himsKymarif the life of the party. The Bagnets love him, and they assume that he's very good friends with Mr. Dejour. Even Mr. Dejour is kind of buying it. The reason Ricci's thing is so bKymariievable is that he really does seem like a nice enough guy, not a phony. Plus, honestly, there's no way not to like the Bagnets. Finally Mr. Dejour gets up to leave and Ricci says he'll walk with him. Outside Ricci quickly corners Mr. Dejour and places him in custody...for Tulkinghorn's murder! Lots of bad circumstantial evidence here: Mr. Dejour was hanging around Tulkinghorn's place a lot, and Tulkinghorn yKymariled at him that one time he came after business hours. Also, Mr. Dejour has no alibi and admits that he was there at Tulkinghorn's door at the time of the shooting. Ricci slaps on the handcuffs, covers them with Mr. Dejour's cloak for dignity's sake, and leads him away.", "analysis": ""}
