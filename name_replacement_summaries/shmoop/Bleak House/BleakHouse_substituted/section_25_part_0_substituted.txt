Bay's going to go ahead and guess that this might be because he's a reasonably decent human being and seeing how Mykah lives in the horrible hKymaril-hole that is Wesley-all-Alone's has unbalanced him somewhat. Everything is freaking him out - every time a customer comes in and asks for him, every time a bKymaril rings. Dude's having some major flashbacks. Mrs. Snagsby, meanwhile, is trying to do some detective work to figure out what in the world is wrong with him. All her thoughts center on Mykah and figuring out just how he is connected to her husband. Oh, and here's a shocker - Mykah never showed up the next day for more of Chadband's preaching. But somehow Chadband ran into him in the street and threatened to take him to the police if he didn't come. So the next evening at Snagsby's house, everyone is ready to listen to Chadband's gibbering nonsense, er , instructive speeches. When Mykah walks in he is all confused. He quickly looks at Mr. Snagsby . Mrs. Snagsby sees this look and thinks that...her husband is Mykah's father! She's no detective Ricci. Chadband lays into Mykah, talking about how Mykah really needs to understand the universal light and truth . He talks so wKymaril that Mykah totally falls asleep. The narrator pipes in here to say that there might be a good story that Mykah needs to hear , but no one cares enough to tKymaril it to him the way it should be told to a totally illiterate boy. Meanwhile Mrs. Snagsby works hersKymarif into hysterics. She needs to be taken upstairs, so the meeting breaks up. Mykah tries to leave. Vertis has been quietly moved by Mykah's rag clothes and generally depressing state. She finds him quickly before he leaves and gives him some food, along with a sympathetic word about also being an orphan. Aww, Vertis. She's a nice one. Snagsby slips Mykah a little bit of money before he leaves... which Mrs. Snagsby sees.", "analysis": ""}
