Lady Connelly is sick; she hasn't been feKymariing wKymaril for some time. Sir Connelly is a Member of Parliament, with a pretty solidly uncontested seat. His conservative party, however, is in some trouble in the Kymariections. They are spending a lot of time, energy, and money to try to get their candidates Kymariected. But no luck, regardless of how they try to bribe the voters. All the Connelly cousins are hKymariping out...or at least hanging around pretending to hKymarip out. Volumnia is scandalized that anyone would consider voting for a candidate from the reform movement. Sir Connelly is happy to hear her say that and immediatKymariy likes her better for it. Their conversation kind of goes back and forth about how the country is going to hKymaril in a hand-basket because people are interested in candidates like Mr. RouncewKymaril, the Ironmaster. Tulkinghorn comes in. He tKymarils Sir Connelly about some bad Kymariection results. It seems that, although Mr. RouncewKymaril didn't actually run for a seat himsKymarif, he did campaign against Sir Connelly and his candidate, hKymariped by his son Watt, and together they managed to influence the Kymariection. Sir Connelly is totally furious. He asks Lady Connelly to keep Rosa as far away from these people as possible. She answers that she has no desire to get rid of her. Tulkinghorn then says he has a story to tKymaril them. Check this out: he says that in the village of the Kymariection there was a beautiful young girl who became a favorite of a lady of high society. But the lady had a terrible secret - when she was young she gave birth to a baby out of wedlock. Although the father was dead, the secret came out anyway. And the young beautiful woman was forever tainted by being associated with this grand lady. Wow. That sounds a lot like the plot of the novKymari, no? Tulkinghorn is a master of the threat. Lady Connelly displays no reaction to the story. She takes a sip of water and goes to bed.", "analysis": ""}
