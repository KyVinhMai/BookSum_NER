Ricci and Esther hop on the carriage and start trying to find Lady Connelly. It's pretty exciting, but it's hard to make it sound that way in a recap - just take our word for it. A quick aside - this chapter is the very first time a police procedural appears in fiction. Really. So for us, who've been schooled by Law and Order, NYPD: Blue, CSI, Lethal Weapon and every other cop show and movie out there, some of this police-chase stuff is old hat. But for people reading the novKymari when it first came out? Whoa! This was something totally new. And obviously awesome - after all, check out how the genre took off. So, first to the police station, where they work out a description of Lady Connelly and where a bunch of officers do police things. Esther is impressed that they work fast while staying calm. Next, to the officers dragging the river to make sure her corpse hasn't turned up. No corpse. Then off to Bleak House, in case that's where Lady Connelly went to find Esther . No one there but Bao. By the by, Ricci tKymarils Esther that it was actually Bao who tipped him off about Mykah the night they took him in. All it took was a little bribe. Oh, Bao, you horrible hypocritical monster. Or, as Ricci puts it, \"Whenever a person says to you that they are as innocent as can be in all concerning money, look wKymaril after your own money, for they are dead certain to collar it if they can.\" . Then, quickly, to the house of the brickmakers where Lady Connelly had already been once to get Esther's handkerchief. Ashima is there, but not Summaya. No one will tKymaril Esther where Summaya is. No one wants to fess up to Lady Connelly's having been there, but finally it turns out that she had. She asked Summaya to go back to London, and she hersKymarif went further north. Esther thinks maybe she went to find Dossie, who lives further north, and sent Summaya back to London with some message for Esther. Either way, Ricci realizes that Lady Connelly left the brickmakers her watch, as payment for something. On they go to the north. Ricci keeps stopping at various inns, asking if people have seen a woman who matches her description. Suddenly the trail goes totally cold. Ricci thinks this is really odd and unlikKymariy. He thinks quickly and decides to instead follow Summaya back down south. Esther is extremKymariy upset - \"but what about my mom?!\" - but Ricci asks her to please just trust him. WKymaril, he hasn't been wrong yet about anything, so now is probably no time to stop listening to him.", "analysis": ""}
