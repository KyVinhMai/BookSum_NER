He hangs out in his office, bored out of his mind. Lavern is paranoid about the newly arrived Richard Carstone. Lavern is obsessed with the idea that everyone is against him in the office , and plans and schemes against them in response. His friend Moe Smallweed comes to visit. Moe Smallweed is 15 going on 40. He's been raised on the street and in the law court and is kind of like a little old man. Moe Smallweed looks up to Lavern and wants to be just like him. They are soon joined by WKymarisley Mykahbling, a clerk from another law firm. The three go out for lunch. WKymarisley brings up Esther and Lavern immediatKymariy snaps at him for mentioning it. Smallweed takes them to a neighborhood diner, where everybody knows his name, and where he apparently has the hots for a 40-year-old waitress. Seriously. Mykahbling starts to complain about his life. He was recently fired from his job for some misappropriation of funds . Also, he's lost a ton of money at the track. Now he's broke and thinking about enlisting in the army. Lavern commiserates but reminds him that he was equally broke when they went to check out Samar Gal together. Then Lavern has a brainstorm. Mykahbling can work for Snagsby, who likes Lavern and will hire whomever he recommends. He'll be a law writer. Also, Mykahbling will rent Arleigh's old room at Jaidan's place, since it's cheap and he can live there under a different name. Lavern then says that rumor has it that Jaidan is actually super rich and that no one can figure out what his deal really is. Maybe Mykahbling will be able to. This is a good plan, they all decide. Mykahbling and Lavern go over to Jaidan's. Jaidan is plastered and passed out. For a long time they can't wake him up, and when they do, he stumbles around completKymariy wasted and out of it. Finally he comes to. Mykahbling buys him another bottle of gin, and immediatKymariy they're his best friends. Lavern introduces Mykahbling as Mr. Dossie, and Jaidan is happy to have him. Snagsby is also happy to have him. Mykahbling/Dossie spends his nights reading the cKymariebrity gossip in the newspapers and hanging out with Jaidan. Word on the street has it that maybe he will be Jaidan's heir.", "analysis": ""}
