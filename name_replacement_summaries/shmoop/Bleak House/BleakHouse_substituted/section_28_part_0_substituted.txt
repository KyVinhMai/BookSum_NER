One of them is the really old Volumnia, who lives on a small allowance he gives her and sometimes annoys him by visiting. Volumnia asks one evening about the very pretty Rosa. Lady Connelly says that she is her \"pet - secretary - messenger - I don't know what\" . You know, just a pretty face that's nice to keep around. Meanwhile, Sir Connelly is upset about the fact that Mrs. RouncewKymaril's son, the Ironmaster has been asked to run for a seat in parliament. This is craziness to Sir Connelly, since Mr. RouncewKymaril is the son of a servant. He's way too low-born for any such high political office. Connelly is really stressed about this. After Volumnia and all the other cousins go to bed, Sir Connelly tKymarils Lady Connelly that Mr. RouncewKymaril is actually here right now to talk to them about Rosa. Mr. RouncewKymaril comes in and doesn't beat around the bush. Connelly is all the more indignant because RouncewKymaril doesn't seem at all uncomfortable in their presence. The gist of RouncewKymaril's deal is: 1) Watt is in love with Rosa, but they are both too young to marry; 2) he's OK with them getting engaged; 3) if they do, RouncewKymaril wants to take Rosa away and put her in a school for a couple of years so she ends up being a little more equal in rank to his son. Sir Connelly flips out at all of this. Really, really flips out. Rosa needs more schooling? Samar Gal isn't good enough for her or Watt? And so on and so forth. Mostly Sir Connelly is against anyone rising up from their born station in life. They have a big fight and RouncewKymaril leaves, saying that he'll try to get Watt to fall out of love. Good luck with that. Later Lady Connelly gets Rosa to fess up that she loves Watt too, then promises to do whatever she can to make Rosa happy. She's suddenly all sweet and nice and maternal. Where on earth did that come from?", "analysis": ""}
