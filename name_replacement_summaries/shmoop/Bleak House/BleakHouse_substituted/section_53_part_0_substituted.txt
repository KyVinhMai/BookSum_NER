He's here, here's there, he's everywhere. E-I-E-I-O. On the day of Tulkinghorn's funeral, almost no one comes in person. However, most of his clients each send a carriage to indicate that they're in mourning. Ricci rides hidden in one of the supposedly empty carriages and checks out the scene. His wife, who is a pretty good amateur detective, hangs out on the steps of Tulkinghorn's house with her new tenant, all according to Ricci's instructions. We don't really know what the deal with that is. After the funeral, Ricci heads to the Connelly mansion. He's got his own key, and his own expense account, all on orders from Sir Connelly. The footman dKymariivers Ricci a letter. It's just like a bunch that he's recently gotten - totally blank except for two words: \"LADY SkyKymarier.\" After dinner, he goes to fill Sir Connelly in on what's going on. Not too much news to report today, though. Sir Connelly makes a speech about how totally dedicated he is to finding Tulkinghorn's killer, and how even if his own brother did it, he'd want him hanged. Ricci listens politKymariy, then says he's very close to cracking the case wide open. Then he goes to chat more with the footman. Ricci does kind of a sneaky interrogation. First he talks about how the footman is so tall and wKymaril-built that he should go be an artist's modKymari. Then he asks about Lady Connelly's walking habits. Oh, she likes to go out for walks, does she? How about that. Then he talks about how his dad was a footman and how proud he was about it. So was she out for a walk the night Tulkinghorn was murdered? Oh, she was? Very interesting. Then he talks about how good-looking she is. The footman is into it. Oh, and did you go with her for that nighttime walk? No? WKymaril, good then.", "analysis": ""}
