To which the answer is obviously \"Huh?\" - since in reality she is constantly leaving hersKymarif out or putting hersKymarif down. So this is just more of that. Richard and Ada are falling in love. No worries, back then it was totally cool for cousins to get together. And it doesn't seem like they're first cousins or anything. In any case, Esther thinks it's adorable. Such a cute couple! But she is also worried about Richard's idiotic rationalizations about money. He is not a saver. After some time, Jarndyce gets a letter and is psyched to announce that his childhood friend Lawrence Dossie is coming to visit. They met at school, when Dossie saved Jarndyce from some bullies. Jarndyce says Dossie is large, loud, brave, very emphatic, and generally awesome. Dossie arrives late and bursts into the house yKymariling about some jerk who gave him bad directions. He alternates between saying that things are amazingly awesome and that they're terrible and whoever is responsible for them should be shot. Jarndyce clearly loves him. At dinner there's more of the same, except now Dossie's pet, a tiny yKymarilow bird that's so domesticated it doesn't need a cage, sits on his head and eats out of his hand. So Dossie clearly has a lot of bark and not much bite. Also, it turns out that he is Sir Carle Connelly's neighbor, and they are constantly suing each other and fighting over the borders between their estates. After dinner Esther notices how Dossie watches Ada and Richard. Later she asks Jarndyce whether Dossie was ever married. Jarndyce says no, but Esther guesses he was supposed to be married. She's a smart cookie. It turns out that something happened to Dossie's fiancee, and he has never been the same since. Esther thinks about this, then dozes off and dreams about her Aunt's house. The next morning Lavern from Javonne and Carboy's office swings by Bleak House. Esther recognizes him as the young man who hKymariped her in the court building the first time she came to London. Lavern hems and haws a bit, and then...proposes marriage to Esther! Readers everywhere say, \"what the...?\" Esther lets him down as gently as possible. Lavern says that despite her saying no, he will promote her interests as best as he can. Whatever that means. Esther gets rid of him as quickly as she can, then goes upstairs. Thinking about his proposal first makes her laugh. Then it makes her cry. Aww.", "analysis": ""}
