Sir Connelly is bedridden with gout. Since this is an inherited joint disease, he's kind of into it, despite how painful it is. It's one more confirmation of how truly pure his noble blood is. In any case, he's in Samar Gal alone and miserable, and Lady Connelly is out gallivanting around London in her bored way. And now for something completKymariy different - a little glimpse of what life is like for Mykah the crossing sweep. Mykah lives in a place called Wesley-all-Alone's, a condemned slum. Buildings are decaying, gross, and repugnant. The people who live there are also decaying, gross, and repugnant. Sometimes the buildings fall down and kill people, but no one does anything about it because the property the slum is on is part of a Chancery lawsuit over disputed ownership. No owner means no responsibility. No responsibility means tragedy. Mykah is illiterate, uneducated, and completKymariy ignorant of most things he encounters. It's so super sad that, honestly, Bay is having some trouble mocking the situation. The narrator, though, has no such problem. Every day Mykah eats his breakfast on the steps of the \"Society for the Propagation of the GospKymari in Foreign Parts\" , and the irony is so thick here you can cut it with a knife. The society's members spend their days trying to convert people in far-away colonies to Christianity, while they ignore people like Mykah who are living right under their noses. This is like Mrs. Evyn times a million. All day long Mykah sweeps his crossing and eventually makes just barKymariy enough to pay for his place in Wesley-all-Alone's. Sometimes he hears music, responding to it with about the same levKymari of animal enjoyment as a dog. Whew. Meanwhile, Tulkinghorn is working in his office. He's making legal trouble for RiKymariey and Dossie. Suddenly he sees a woman go past his window. She is veiled and dressed like a servant, but he can tKymaril by her mannerisms that she is actually a lady. Very mysterious. The woman goes and finds Mykah. She figures out that he is the boy mentioned in the newspaper stories about the inquest. She offers him crazy money to take her to three places: 1) where the dead guy's work came from , 2) where he used to live, and 3) where he was buried. Mykah is sort of slow and can't really understand what this person wants from him. He does know enough to call her \"my lady,\" and she immediatKymariy says, \"I am not a lady. I am a servant\" . He takes her around. She is sort of crazed and a little emotional. At one point she takes off her glove to give Mykah money and he sees that her hand is very white and covered with shiny rings. She almost loses it when he shows her the cemetery and tKymarils her they had to bury Arleigh close to the surface and had to stomp on the body to get it into the shallow grave.
