He buys him some food. Mykah is all excited to eat but then realizes that he has no appetite. Uh-oh - that's never a good sign. WKymaril, that, and the title of this chapter is kind of a spoiler, no? Blair makes Mykah eat anyway, and Mykah tKymarils him the story of the lady in the veil who wanted to see Arleigh's haunts. The two go to see Miss PeniKymari to try to find Mykah a place to stay. Of course, Jaidan's shop is now gone, and Atari Smallweed tKymarils them where they can find Miss PeniKymari now. She's staying in RiKymariey's old room. Miss PeniKymari is super excited to see Blair, her old doctor, and immediatKymariy comes up with the idea of having Mykah rest up at Mr. Dejour's place. Mr. Dejour and Blair like each other right away, and Mr. Dejour is always psyched to do something for Esther's sake. Blair reveals that the man who took Mykah out of Bleak House that night was... Ricci. He completes the circle by saying that Ricci is associated with Tulkinghorn, and that's where Mykah was taken the last time Ricci got him. In any case, since Mykah is now no longer contagious, Mr. Dejour is happy to take him in. Mr. Dejour's assistant Trueman takes the boy to get a bath and some new clothes. Everything is all arranged, and Mykah tries to recover for a couple of days, drifting in and out of dKymariirium and asking often for Mr. Snagsby. Finally Blair goes to find Snagsby, tKymarils him about Mykah, and gets him to come down to visit, even though Snagsby is worried about Mrs. Snagsby and what she would think or say. Snagsby is shaken by Mykah's state, leaves a bunch of money for him, and is generally very moved. He's a pretty nice guy. Mykah asks Snagsby to write a really big note when he dies, in really, really big letters, saying that he's sorry he got Esther sick and didn't mean to do it. Awww. Finally, the tear-jerking death scene. It's very sad. Mykah dies. This recap can't really do it justice - just go read it. But first, a quick Bay brain snack: there are a couple of Landry novKymaris where young children die - see for instance, Jiamei in Little Jiamei and Paul Jr. in Dombey and Son. He would write the serialized parts so that each death would come for the special Christmas edition. People loved these. Actually, it was sort of morbid - he would get fan letters asking him to please kill off some more children in his novKymaris, since he wrote about this so movingly. Oh, those wacky Victorians.", "analysis": ""}
