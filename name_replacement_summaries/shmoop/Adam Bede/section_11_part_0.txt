Now we get to spend some time with Arthur Donnithorne. Arthur is lounging in his rooms and planning a fishing expedition. He's also dreaming about all the good things he'll do when he takes over the estate--that is, when his unpleasant, inept grandfather kicks the bucket. Arthur then goes outside to the stables. Some time around evening, Arthur decides to take a walk in Hetty's direction, all with the intention of getting a glimpse of her. This last once-over should \"get rid of the whole thing from his mind\" . Right. Because the best way to get over a crush is to go and stare at that crush. When they bump into each other, Hetty is bashful and Arthur is \"conscious of blushing too\" . The two of them are now alone together, for the very first time. Arthur begins with some small talk about the needlework and mending that Hetty does for the Donnithornes. Then he brings up Mr. Craig. And Hetty blushes more. And...cries? Arthur consoles her. There's something about their contact that seems, you know, magical now: \"They mingle as easily as two brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves\" is how the narrator puts it . But soon the magic is over. They pull apart. Arthur departs hastily, returns home, and hunkers down with his stirred-up feelings. Then it's time for crotchety old Grandfather Donnithorne's diner. Anything, anything to take his mind off Hetty.", "analysis": ""}
