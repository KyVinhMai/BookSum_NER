Answer : 0%. The truth is, \"Hetty was thinking a great deal more of the looks Captain Donnithorne had cast at her than of Adam and his troubles\" . Okay then... What are we supposed to make of Hetty? Loathe her? Despise her? Not quite. She's not a heroic type, but she isn't a terrible person. Instead, she thinks a lot about the many, many men who have crushes on her. These men include a slouching, silent fellow named Luke Britton and a flowery gardener named Mr. Craig. And Adam, who's a real catch, and who's the one the Poysers want her to pursue. Adam spends a lot of time lingering around the Hall Farm, but \"Hetty had never given Adam any steady encouragement\" . He just doesn't have that \"special something\" she wants. But now she's found somebody who does--Arthur Donnithorne. Until now, Hetty and Arthur have always been at a distance from each other. True, Hetty sometimes helps out around the Donnithorne mansion. But today Arthur spoke to her. And Hetty--who dreams of carriage rides, and fine clothes, and getting the heck off the Hall Farm--is forming a fantasy: she'll be the love of Arthur's life. Meanwhile, Arthur Donnithorne has had a revelation or two of his own. He and Mr. Irwine are just riding along, minding their own business, when Irwine asks: \"What so fascinated you in Mrs. Poyser's dairy, Arthur?\" . Arthur can't help admitting that this \"fascination\" was Hetty. Mr. Irwine has no problem with this, so long as Arthur simply contemplates Hetty \"in an artistic light\" . And what other light is there, for our favorite Donnithorne? Arthur believes that Hetty would be \"a capital match for Adam\" . So we can assume that he'll just continue with his \"artistic\" contemplation, right?", "analysis": ""}
