But Hetty--who'll be our eyes on the ground for this chapter--could care less. All Hetty can think of is her upcoming meeting. With Arthur. As she performs her duties around the Donnithorne estate, Hetty's \"little butterfly soul\" flutters \"incessantly between memory and dubious expectation\" . Hetty is hoping to see \"Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again\" in the woods . By twilight she's left chez Donnithorne and is approaching a bend in the forest path where she should run into Arthur. But he isn't there. Hetty is beginning to cry with disappointment when Arthur comes into sight after all. He notices the crying. He's kind as can be. And yet, he feels very, very \"uncomfortable\" . Arthur departs quickly, yet kindly, and rushes homeward. Yes, this is troubling stuff, this \"attracted to a girl you could never, ever, ever marry\" business. And Arthur needs a sympathetic ear. He decides that he will \"go and tell Mr. Irwine--tell him everything\" . He'll be able to sleep easy then.", "analysis": ""}
