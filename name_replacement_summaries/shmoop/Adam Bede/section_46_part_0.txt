But Dinah is with her, and compassionately exhorts her to \"pray without ceasing to God\" . All at once, without warning, Hetty shrieks. And the crowd cries out, too. Why is everyone shouting? \"It was a shout of sudden excitement at the appearance of a horseman cleaving the crowd at full gallop\" . And who is that horseman? It's Arthur, bringing Hetty \"a hard-won release from death\" . And bringing us a hard won-release from seriousness. Hetty is saved.", "analysis": ""}
