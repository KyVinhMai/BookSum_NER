The local forecast: \"Perfect weather for an outdoor July merrymaking\" . The local traffic report: \"It was a time of leisure on the farm--that pause between hay- and corn-harvest\" . Everybody is chillin' like a villain, or a villager, or a villainous villager. That is, until the festivities begin. While everyone is taking it easy, Hetty is in her room. She's dressed fancier than usual, and she's got an extraordinary pair of \"gold and pearls and garnet\" earrings . The earrings, of course, are a gift from Arthur. But Hetty won't be wearing them to Arthur's birthday. Suspicions might be aroused! She loads herself into a cart with the rest of the Poysers, and they depart. Some day, Hetty will wear those earrings all she likes. For now, she has to listen to Mrs. Poyser complaining about the local tramps and old Martin Poyser telling his tales of times gone by. Meanwhile, Arthur and Mr. Irwine are touring the Donnithorne estate, putting the finishing touches on the birthday plans. Arthur can't help looking around at the old house and planning yet more improvements. What is it with all these improvements? Was old Squire Donnithorne really that bad? Not really. In fact, the old Squire \"has come round after all\" and is going to bring in Adam to look after the Donnithorne woods . Arthur is proud that he's been able to help Adam out in this way, and Irwine is proud of Arthur because Arthur is proud. But don't underestimate Squire Donnithorne. He gave in on Adam and the woods, but he still has \"nothing in the shape of a steward\" to manage his affairs . But this is a subject for another time. Arthur's birthday awaits.", "analysis": ""}
