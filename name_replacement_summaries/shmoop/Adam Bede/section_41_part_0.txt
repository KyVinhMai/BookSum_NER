Heavens, will we never leave this dreadful town? Adam himself feels trapped, crushed by the \"irremediable evil and suffering\" that surrounds Hetty's crime . Yet there is a silver lining. Adam now looks \"back on all the previous years as if they had been a dim sleepy existence, and he had only now awakened to full consciousness\" . Otherwise, he's too anguished to get in a square meal, or say a nice word to Bartle Massey . Don't worry, Bartle. We appreciate your efforts. The one thing that Bartle is good for, though, is telling Adam all about the trial. And not just the charges and evidence against Hetty--also things like how Hetty looks and how she reacts . Wow, this is the most depressing chapter ever. Let's wind it up. Finally, when Bartle describes Mr. Irwine's kindness toward Hetty, Adam shows a little gratitude. \"God bless him, and you too, Mr. Massey,\" says Adam . Finally. But Bartle isn't one to sugarcoat. There is strong evidence against Hetty; the verdict could easily go against her. Adam, knowing this, decides it would be \"cowardly of me to keep away\" from the courtroom any longer . So we're leaving this dreary apartment... and heading to a dreary courtroom. Thanks a lot, Eliot.", "analysis": ""}
