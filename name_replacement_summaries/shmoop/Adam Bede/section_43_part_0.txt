Sure, we've just spent the past five chapters watching Hetty's and Adam's lives implode. But Arthur hasn't. In fact, when this chapter opens, he's just received news of his grandfather's death. He reacts: \"Poor Grandfather! I wish I could have got to be with him when he died\" . But he won't let it get him down. In fact, he isn't \"gotten down\" at all. Arthur is now \"coming into a splendid estate through the death of a very old man whom he was not fond of\" . No, Arthur isn't going to be putting this in Squire Donnithorne's obituary. In fact, he isn't thinking of Squire Donnithorne's obituary at all. As he rides home, Arthur's mind runs on the improvements he'll make around Hayslope, the kindnesses he'll do Mr. Irwine, and the upcoming Hetty and Adam marriage. Boy, is he in for a bubble-bursting. He arrives at \"dear old Hayslope at last, sleeping, on the hill, like a quiet old place as it was, in the late afternoon sunlight\" . He arrives back at his estate, where all the servants are \"assembled to receive him with a grave, decent welcome\" . Poor guy. Lost his grandfather and ruined a bunch of characters' lives. Just don't tell him quite yet... After dealing with the family lawyer and consoling a tearful Aunt Lydia, Arthur retreats to his dressing room. He has \"several letters and packets\" . The one on top seems to be from Mr. Irwine. Arthur inspects the letter. It seems that Mr. Irwine has something pressing to say. Arthur opens the letter. And then it hits him: \"Hetty Sorrel is in prison, and will be tried on Friday for the crime of child-murder\" . Arthur races out of the room. In a \"muffled tone of agitation,\" he tells his butler he's off to Stoniton and rides off like mad on his horse .", "analysis": ""}
