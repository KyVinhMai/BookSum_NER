He's back. There has been \"much excited discussion\" about this fellow's return at the local inn . Now, Mrs. Poyser--the heroine of this chapter--doesn't frequent the local inn. But the news of the stranger's reappearance strikes her even more strongly than anyone else. One day soon after the stranger pops back up, Mrs. Poyser sees old Squire Donnithorne approaching the Hall Farm. Old Squire Donnithorne doesn't get out of the house much. But when he does, he sure causes a ruckus. \"I shouldna wonder if he's come about that man as is a-going to take the Chase farm, wanting Poyser to do something for him without pay,\" imagines Mrs. Poyser . In short: \"Squire Donnithorne's coming here to play us for a bunch of suckers.\" He sure is. Although he speaks politely, Squire Donnithorne has an unpleasant proposition. He wants to take some of the Poysers' land , give it to a new tenant , and give them a different piece of land instead . And yes, you're going to need a really good map of Hayslope to understand any of this. But Mrs. Poyser, she understands it all. She knows that Donnithorne is trying to cheat her. She's in no mood to \"make a martyr o' myself, and wear myself to skin and bone\" with the extra work and extra expenses that Squire Donnithorne's changeroo will create . Not this Poyser! No, this Poyser launches into a grand old rant. Squire Donnithorne attempts to beat a retreat, \"waving his hand towards her with a smile\" . But nobody brushes off this Poyser. She follows Squire Donnithorne right out, yells at him as he saddles his pony and rides off. All to the great amusement of the Hall Farm's hired help, no less. But Mr. Poyser is not amused. Well, okay, maybe a little. But he is afraid that sneaky old Donnithorne will evict them and force them to move \"into a strange parish\" . Mrs. Poyser, however, isn't worrying about the consequences right now. She's had her say and man does it feel good.", "analysis": ""}
