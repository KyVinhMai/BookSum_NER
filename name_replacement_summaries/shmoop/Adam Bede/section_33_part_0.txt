{"name": "Chapter 34", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-34", "summary": "It's now \"a dry Sunday, and really a pleasant day for the second of November\" . For Pete's sake, is every day in Adam Bede \"really a pleasant day?\" Well, this one isn't pleasant for everyone. Mrs. Poyser is laid up with a cold, and Hetty has taken the Poyser boys to church on her own. And Adam joins them on the way back. Just like he did in Chapter 30. Should we admire this habit of his, or be a bit creeped out? But before you start thinking \"wait a second, have we seen this chapter before?\" take a look at this. Adam offers Hetty his arm. And she takes it. Adam has spent the last few months dealing with a \"new restlessness to his passion\" . He's really manning up, really going after his gal. Too bad Hetty couldn't care less. Adam also has some exciting news. As he proudly declares, \"Mr. Burge has offered me a share in his business, and I'm going to take it\" . Now he has Hetty's attention, but not because she's excited for him. No, her vanity is hurt; she thinks Adam will shift his affections to Mr. Burge's daughter. She even breaks into tears. But Adam, kind, gentle Adam, really mans up now. He tells Hetty that \"I shall never want to be married if you won't have me\" . And Hetty, sad, wounded, still missing Arthur, gives in. The newly engaged couple returns to the Poysers' house, and Adam asks Mr. and Mrs. Poyser if they have any objections to the marriage. Objections, hah! \"What objections can we ha' to you, lad?\" asks Mr. Poyser . Well, Hetty has a few. Starting with \"Adam isn't Arthur.\" Since nobody will be playing the objections game tonight, Adam, Hetty, and the Poysers start planning ahead. They talk quite a bit about finding Adam \"a house that would do for him to settle in\" . True, the whole Mrs. Poyser versus Old Donnithorne incident still hangs over the house, but Martin is confident that \"the captain 'ull come home and make our peace\" .", "analysis": ""}
