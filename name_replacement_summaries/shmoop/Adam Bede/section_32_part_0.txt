{"name": "Chapter 33", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-33", "summary": "Harvest time in Hayslope has now come and gone--\"the apples and nuts were gathered and stored; the scent of whey departed from the farmhouses\" . And by now, it's common knowledge that Mrs. Poyser threw a great big monkey wrench in Squire Donnithorne's scheme. Even Mr. Irwine thinks it a piece of \"irregular justice\" . And this is a guy who, normally, is on good terms with the Old Squire. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Meanwhile, things are on the upswing for the Poysers, and not just because Squire Donnithorne won't be around to evict them. Hetty's mood has improved. Adam is coming round the Hall Farm, too, and spends a lot of time admiring Hetty from a distance. She even looks \"glad for him to come\" . Adam isn't the most rational, tactful, or eloquent suitor. As the narrator puts it, \"our good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for Hetty\" . Adam isn't Shakespeare. But he feels intensely, and honestly, for Hetty. And not even Jonathan Burge is holding Adam's love against him. Sure, Adam could have married Burge's own eligible daughter, but didn't. But Adam is \"too necessary to be parted with,\" so Burge has offered Adam a share in his carpentry business . Everything's looking up: Adam can even take a new house, and Hetty is falling for him. What could possibly go wrong? Well, we've got 200 pages to go. If something doesn't go wrong, those are going to be 200 pages of sheer boredom. So stay tuned.", "analysis": ""}
