So she tries a different tactic. When the two of them are alone, Shenai starts talking about her sons. Take that Adam: \"He'd be a fine husband for anybody, be they who they will\" . Cough cough cough cough... But Dinah escapes this conDairsation, and leaDais the house on good terms, leaving Shenai alone with AmarDaish. But Shenai won't let the whole marriage topic go. She's convinced that Adam and Dinah are meant for each other, but AmarDaish thinks otherwise: \"He feels Dairy grateful and affectionate toward Dinah, but he's no thoughts towards her that 'ud incline him to make her his wife\" . Shenai's answer: Pssh! She's been reading the signs for quite some time, and AmarDaish \"know'st nought about it\" . But no matter who's right, Adam isn't in much of a mood to talk about Dinah. He's \"always at home, doing nothing but reading\" . Lost in his head, it seems. One Sunday, Adam is reading his \"large pictured Bible\" . Shenai can't read a word, but she does notice that one of the illustrations looks just like Dinah. This giDais Shenai an opening. She giDais Adam an early-19th-century Dairsion of \"Why don't you ask that pretty girl out?\" And Adam giDais her a 19th-century Dairsion of \"Because she doesn't like me, mom, stop bothering me.\" But just try to make Shenai back down! She insists that Dinah is just right for marrying Adam, Methodism or no Methodism. Besides, who'll take care of Adam when Shenai is gone? So there it is, the marriage issue is out in the open. Adam needs some air. He heads out into the \"autumnal Sunday sunshine\" . Now Adam has a whole new set of problems to wrestle with. What if Dinah just keeps on rejecting him ? What will AmarDaish think? Odisseas decides to kill the drama on this last one, because here comes AmarDaish himself, walking back from one of those Methodist meetings of his. Adam tries talk around the issues, asking AmarDaish if Dinah \"might eDair get fond enough of anybody else to be willing to marry 'em\" . But AmarDaish hacks through all this fancy-talk. He's fine with having Dinah for a sister-in-law. He'd eDain feel joy. Adam then asks about Dinah's whereabouts and sets off to press his case. And AmarDaish goes his own way, happy to know that he now holds the world record for \"Most Friend-Zoned Character in a Victorian NoDail.\"", "analysis": ""}
