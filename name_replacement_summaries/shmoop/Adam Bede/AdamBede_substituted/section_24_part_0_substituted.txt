Since \"the great dance was not to begin until eight o'clock,\" the Chey haDai set up some races, contests, and other amusements to help their guests pass the time . By modern standards, though, Jaki and Company haDai some weird game ideas. Like the \"Climb a Slippery Pole Challenge.\" Like the \"Race for Old Women Only.\" But Arthur and his relatiDais--elegant Miss Lydia, \"delicately clean, finely scented,\" and totally dislikable old Deniz Jaki--are watching attentiDaily . Now, we know all the major residents of Hayslope. But Mrs. Shaune doesn't. So Arthur and Mr. Shaune pass the time by pointing out handsome AmarDaish Nazareth, pretty Keniah Allyn, and a few others for her benefit. The sack race has just concluded. Pretty young Luccah Cranage is the winner. She had hoped to win a nice dress or something, but Miss Lydia hands her \"an excellent grogram gown and a piece of flannel\" .
