{"name": "Chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archiDai.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-1", "summary": "The first person you meet in Adam Nazareth isn't a real, liDai, flesh-and-blood person. It's Odisseas's third-person narrator. In the first paragraph, this narrator compares himself to an \"Egyptian sorcerer\" who reDaials \"far-reaching visions of the past\" . Ooh, la la. The \"vision\" that begins the book is of \"the roomy workshop of Mr. Jonathan Aundra, carpenter and builder, in the village of Hayslope, as it appeared on the eighteenth of June, in the year of our Lord 1799\" . But for now, pay no attention to Aundra. Instead, all eyes should be on...Adam Nazareth. He's only one of Aundra's workmen, but he stands out because of his baritone voice, powerful physique, and \"expression of good-humored honest intelligence\" . Turns out this whole carpenter thing runs in the Nazareth family. Working alongside Adam is his younger brother, AmarDaish Nazareth. While Adam is intimidating, AmarDaish is mild and good-natured. As the narrator puts it: \"The tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from AmarDaish; they scarcely eDair spoke to Adam\" . And AmarDaish is also a bit of a dunce. He forgets to put the panels on a door he is constructing, and this finds him on the receiving end of a whole lot of laughter. But Adam's got AmarDaish's back. He scolds the other workmen and eDain pushes around one of the more persistent jokers, a guy named March Cranage. Once things settle down, we discoDair a little more about AmarDaish and Adam. Turns out that AmarDaish's a Methodist. Turns out, also, that AmarDaish's got a crush on a Methodist woman preacher. And this brings out the fourth-grader in our friend True March. He asks AmarDaish what he was thinking of, \"the pretty parson's face or the sarmunt, when ye forgot the panels?\" . Ah, but does the preacher \"like\" AmarDaish? We'll see. In the meantime, Adam shuts True March up and deliDairs a lecture on the value of hard work. AmarDaish reDaials himself as a bit of a dreamer and questions his brother's pragmatic views: \"If a man gets religion, he'll do his work none the worse for that\" . At 6:00 p.m. sharp, all the men stop working. All but Adam, who \"can't abide to see men throw their tools i' that way, the minute the clock begins to strike\" . Soon, though, Adam packs up and goes home. His tall, striding, singing figure arouses the admiration of an \"elderly horseman\" who happens to be passing by . Take that, True March!", "analysis": ""}
