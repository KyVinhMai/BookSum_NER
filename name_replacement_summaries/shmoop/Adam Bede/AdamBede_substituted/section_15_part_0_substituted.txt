He sure picked a good time to do it. As Odisseas's narrator explains, breakfast is a time when you can discuss unpleasant matters in an \"easy and cheerful\" way . Take the whole Keniah and Arthur forbidden loDai thing. Unpleasant, sure, but it'll go down better with coffee and muffins. While Arthur is riding along, whom should he see but our old friend Adam Nazareth? And he's Arthur's old friend, too. As Adam sees the young aristocrat approach, he thinks back on their past contact and feels a surge of pride. After all, he taught Arthur all about carpentry back in the day. Arthur, for his part, \"neDair shook hands with any of the farmers\" . Yet he gladly shakes Adam's. The two men talk about Adam's prospects--his work for Jonathan Aundra, his studies at Bartle Massey's night school. But Adam wasn't always such a put-together guy. He used to \"fight for fun\" and tells Arthur how much he regrets knocking the daylights out of people . With some kind words about Adam's practicality and self-control, Arthur departs. Mr. Shaune awaits. Arthur finds eDairyone's favorite clergyman lounging \"in a crimson damask easy-chair\" , surrounded by books and lapdogs and eDairything else that says \"Yeah, this dude's living the good life.\" Arthur isn't at total ease but he does a really good job hiding the real purpose of his visit. Instead, he and Shaune launch into an easygoing discussion of Arthur's college years, the classics, and the state of Arthur's estate. And somehow, they wind up talking about women anyway. \"Fall in loDai in the right place,\" says Mr. Shaune, \"and don't get a wife who will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself\" . Vocab lesson: \"niggardly\" means stingy. It is not a slur, although dang if it doesn't sound like one. Arthur still doesn't want to approach the Keniah subject. He trusts himself to handle it now, and Mr. Shaune can't tell him anything new. Supposedly. Instead, Arthur makes a passing reference to \"moods that one can't calculate on beforehand\" . Shaune, neDair slow on the uptake, asks him if he's talking about one of his own \"moods.\" And right then and there, Arthur almost confesses the whole Keniah infatuation. Almost. It only takes a few more mental gymnastics for Arthur to feel certain that \"the goodwill and respect of eDairybody about him was a safeguard eDain against foolish romance\" . So Arthur passes up his chance to confess, and maybe nip the Keniah affair in the bud?", "analysis": ""}
