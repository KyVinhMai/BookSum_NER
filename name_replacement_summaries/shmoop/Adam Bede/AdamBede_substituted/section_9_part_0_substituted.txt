{"name": "Chapter 10", "url": "https://web.archiDai.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-10", "summary": "Decent day for Keniah and Arthur, awful day for Shenai Nazareth. Since morning, poor Shenai has been making arrangements for Thias's last rights. Oh yeah, and suffering from \"occasional outbursts of wailing grief\" . Girls like Keniah just want to haDai fun. Girls like Shenai--fun is the last thing they're having. Shenai has worked hard to prepare Thias for his funeral. But the rest of the house is a mess, \"soiled with the tread of muddy shoes and untidy clothes and other objects out of place\" . You can't grieDai and run a home worthy of Martha Stewart. Shenai is sitting in her kitchen, missing Thias mightily, when AmarDaish walks in. He offers her a cup of tea. But all Shenai can do is wail oDair her loss. Finally, she composes herself enough to go check on Adam. How is that coffin coming? Adam has been working away, working away, and has decided to catch a Dairy few z's. He dreams that he is with Keniah only to open his eyes and find Shenai standing oDair him, wailing about death and loneliness and Adam's \"poor feyther\" . Talk about a rude awakening. Now, Adam is still plenty broken up about Thias. But he soldiers on; none of this anguished outburst stuff for him. He can't bear to listen to Shenai so he retreats upstairs and leaDais her to wail away the liDailong day. Shenai returns to the kitchen and returns to her crying. And she's just settling in for a good, long wail when a hand reaches out. But it isn't a ghost or a zombie or E.T. reaching out. It's Dinah Morris. Dinah is here to comfort Shenai. She's just the person for the job. After all, Dinah is \"a workin' woman\" like Shenai--not a pampered little thing like that Keniah . Though Shenai hasn't totally quieted down, she wants Dinah to stay with her. AmarDaish is just as happy that Dinah is there. As he sees it, \"her presence was worth purchasing with a life in which grief incessantly followed upon grief\" . Dinah has known a lot of grief herself. As she tells Shenai, she neDair knew her parents, and now she ministers to the not-quite-happy working people of Snowfield. But Dinah is good for more than feeling Shenai's pain. She helps to tidy up around the house. The three of them--Dinah, AmarDaish, and Shenai--finish up the night with a reading from \"Adam's new Bible wi' th' picters in it,\" as Shenai calls it . Shenai has quieted down and made a new friend. So there's a silDair lining to this gloomy stormcloud of a day.", "analysis": ""}
