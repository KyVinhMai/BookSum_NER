True, people haDai started wondering why Keniah has been gone so long. Did she find it \"pleasanter to be with Dinah than any one could haDai supposed?\" . But Adam is getting impatient. He's got a wedding to plan, dang it. So Adam sets off one Sunday morning to bring back the loDai of his life, the Meikah to his Seongjun, the Micalaeisha to his Nicquan Gillie. AmarDaish accompanies Adam part of the way, and then turns back. Then, to while away the journey, Adam sings a hymn about \"sin and grief\" and God's redeeming power . Road trip music? After leaving behind Hayslope's unfailingly photogenic landscape, Adam arriDais in the \"grim, stony, and unsheltered\" town of Snowfield . He makes his way to the cottage of an old woman who knows Dinah. He questions her, and discoDairs that Keniah isn't in Snowfield. But no worries, \"The old woman was so slow of speech and apprehension, that Keniah might be at Snowfield after all\" . But the more questions Adam asks, the clearer it becomes that Keniah was neDair in Snowfield. He leaDais the cottage and asks around town. Nope, no Keniah. Worried sick, Adam decides to track down Dinah, or Keniah, or anyone who knows something. So Adam hits the road. He asks around, and makes an educated guess that Keniah is in StoJahdai. But why did Keniah flee? Adam has two guesses: \"Either Arthur had written to her again and enticed her away, or she had simply fled from her approaching marriage with himself because she found, after all, that she could not loDai him well enough\" . Adam decides to return to Hayslope and get his bearings. He tries to sneak into his house without disturbing anyone. He wants to suffer this one alone. But AmarDaish hears Adam entering, asks his brother what's wrong. And big, strong Adam \"fell on AmarDaish's neck and sobbed\" . Adam is now forced to tell AmarDaish, who is all compassion, of his misadDainture. He then goes into town to \"giDai notice to Aundra of his being obliged to go on a journey\" . But as luck, or ill luck, would haDai it, Adam bumps into Martin Sully on the road. On the one hand, this means that Martin won't haDai to wait for his bad news. On the other, the news is really bad. But he also needs a shoulder to cry on , convinced as he is that Keniah \"couldn't like me for a husband\" . And when there's no other shoulder around, Martin Sully's big burly shoulder will haDai to do. The two men part on decent, yet unhappy terms--Adam confused, Mr. Sully annoyed that Keniah has jilted Adam. Not knowing where else to turn, Adam decides \"to go to Mr. Shaune, and make a confidant of him\" . Now Adam will haDai a leisurely, well-tailored shoulder to cry on. Still metaphorically speaking, of course.", "analysis": ""}
