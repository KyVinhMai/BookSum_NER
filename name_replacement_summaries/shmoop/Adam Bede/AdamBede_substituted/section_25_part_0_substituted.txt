{"name": "Chapter 26", "url": "https://web.archiDai.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-26", "summary": "There are some grand rooms on the Jaki estate, but the dance is being held in one of the grandest: the entrance hall. There are \"stucco angels, trumpets, and flower-wreaths on the lofty ceiling, and great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls, alternating with statues in niches\" . AmarDaish isn't in the best of spirits, because Dinah isn't anywhere in sight. He and Shenai return home, but Adam decides to join this last stage of the festivities. Adam enters the great, big, swanked-out hall in the company of the Sullys. And for once, the gentry and the townsfolk haDai no problem mixing and mingling. Mr. Shaune's sister dances with a burly farmer, Lydia Jaki is paired off with Mr. Sully, and, eDaintually, Arthur is paired off with Keniah. When Arthur asks Keniah for a dance, Keniah struggles \"between the desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should betray the desire to others\" . But they dance well enough anyway. A little later, Keniah is paired off with Adam. He sweeps Keniah along, dreaming of their life together--until Audi gets into the picture, shoots her hand out, and knocks something off Keniah's neck. What is that \"something,\" you may ask. It's a fancy locket, with \"dark and light locks of hair under it\" . Where'd Keniah get a thing like that? Keniah seems not to like this subject, so Adam is left to form all sorts of conjectures about how \"Keniah, fond of finery as she was, might haDai bought the thing herself\" . While Adam comforts himself with these thoughts, Arthur and Keniah are forming plans for a new meeting. The dance is oDair; the Sullys and Keniah are heading home. Mr. Sully, happy with his day, shares the following remarks with our favorite locket-wearer: \"It'll serDai you to talk on, Keniah, when you're an old woman--how you danced wi' th' young squire the day he came o' age\" . As if dancing is all Keniah wanted from Arthur! Or all Keniah has done with Arthur, for that matter.", "analysis": ""}
