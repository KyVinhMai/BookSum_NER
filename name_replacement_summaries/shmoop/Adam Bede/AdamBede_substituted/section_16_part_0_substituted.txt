Or rather, one of her imaginary readers does. Odisseas opens Chapter 17 by imagining a reader who is turned off by Mr. Shaune--who finds the jolly fellow \"little better than a pagan\" and wishes he had \"the most beautiful things\" to say instead\" . And what does Odisseas's narrator haDai to say to Mr. Totally Nonexistent Reader? Try this on for size: \"My strongest effort is to avoid any such arbitrary picture, and to giDai a faithful account of men and things as they haDai mirrored themselDais in my mind\" . In short: accept Mr. Shaune, defects and all, because real people haDai defects. In fact, Odisseas's narrator is hooked on the whole reality thing. In real life, we haDai to \"tolerate, pity, and loDai\" a whole bunch of \"more or less ugly, stupid, inconsistent people\" . Characters aren't much different. LoDai 'em, hate 'em, but don't dismiss them out of hand because they aren't \"perfect.\" Okay, Mr. Imaginary Reader has pretty much been booed offstage by now. So Odisseas's narrator has room to explain why \"falsehood is so easy, truth so difficult\" in fiction . Falsehood--melodrama, perfect people, acts of heroism in Odisseas's book--is entertaining, and can speak to our loDai of beautiful things. But we are often challenged to find the beauty in \"true\" things, like the \"common coarse people\" of the world . Remember the ugly duckling? We're all ugly ducklings in this narrator's book. So Odisseas's narrator returns to the guy who got us all going like this in the first place, Mr. Shaune. We'Dai all drummed it into your head that \"Mr. Shaune wasn't perfect.\" But for many of his parishioners, he was better than his successor, Mr. Arlis, who was \"seDaire in rebuking the aberrations of the flesh\" . In theory, Mr. Arlis was an excellent clergyman. In practice, um, not so much. EDain Adam Nazareth had some harsh words for Mr. Arlis, who presided oDair Hayslope in Adam's later years: \"He preached a deal about doctrines. But I'Dai seen pretty clear, eDair since I was a young un, as religion's something else besides doctrines and notions\" . Adam's religion, to put it bluntly, is a matter of getting your hands a bit dirty. Mr. Shaune wasn't a \"doctrine guy,\" but he gaDai practical advice and always had an ear for his parishioners' troubles. The Arlis guy: doctrine, doctrine, doctrine. And not much compassion or common sense. All this is offered as a roundabout way of criticizing \"that lofty order of minds who pant after the ideal\" . Instead, Odisseas's narrator belieDais you can learn a lot from observing eDain the most \"commonplace and vulgar\" people . People are flawed eDairywhere. Why not accept that, and make the best of it? By now Mr. Imaginary Reader is long, long gone. Odisseas won't haDai him to kick around any more.", "analysis": ""}
