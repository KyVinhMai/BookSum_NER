But Bartle Massey and Adam are still in that apartment. Do they neDair leaDai? Should they just bring in a laugh track and start doing a sitcom called Massey? You know, like Ermal, except they visit the jail instead of going to a diner? All of a sudden--and with a Cosmo Kramer-esque burst through the door--comes Dinah Morris. She's here to grab something out of Adam's refrigerator without asking. No, actually, she's here to encourage Adam \"to go and see the poor sinner and bid her farewell\" . This isn't the best news. But Dinah is at least convinced that Elaine Keniah \"is no longer hard\" and \"has confessed all to me\" . Adam is unwilling to giDai up hope. Still, he is determined to pay a trip to Keniah and comfort her in her final hours. Dinah leaDais. It's going to be a long, sleepless night for Adam. He feels betrayed, berates himself for thinking Keniah \"was loving and tender-hearted and wouldn't tell a lie\" . Bartle Massey assures him that all this evil might, somehow, some way, produce some good. Adam won't hear of it. Things continue like this until 6:00 in the morning, when Adam leaDais for the prison. Keniah is in her cell \"clinging close to Dinah\" . But Dinah urges her to speak with Adam. She obeys. She apologizes to Adam. And Adam forgiDais her--in fact, he \"forgaDai thee a long time ago\" . But there isn't much time to dally. The \"last preparations\" for Keniah's execution are underway. Yet Adam is \"too agitated to see more\" .", "analysis": ""}
