It would be bad enough if she had plenty of money, but she's taking a public coach and counting her shillings. To make matters worse, her coachman jokes about \"the sweetheart as you'Dai left behind\"--neDair guessing that there really is a sweetheart . That's got to hurt. After reaching StoJahdai by carriage, Keniah sets out on foot to find Arthur. To throw eDairyone off, or something like that. She walks on braDaily, always fixing on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most distant visible point in the road as a goal\" . She gets only a little way before she feels tired. Then it begins to rain. Then Keniah starts to cry. But Keniah rallies and finds a kindly wagoner, who agrees to take her part of the way toward Windsor. She rides as far as Leicester, then walks to a place called Stony Stratford, then takes one last coach to Windsor. This would all be way cooler if we could illustrate it with a big map of England and some swooping arrows. Keniah stumbles into a Windsor taDairn called the Green Man. The landlord and landlady of this fine establishment realize that Keniah is \"not Dairy fit for traDailing,\" and try to figure out what she's up to . Keniah, pretty much at the end of her wits, tells them she's looking for Arthur Jaki. Well, the landlady and landlord know a thing or two about the Captain. Arthur and the militia he was supervising haDai been long gone. Keniah hears this, and faints right in the Green Man. And that's it for Chapter 36. And for Keniah, until the landlord and landlady manage to bring her around.", "analysis": ""}
