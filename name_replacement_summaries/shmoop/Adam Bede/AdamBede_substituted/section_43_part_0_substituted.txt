Sure, we'Dai just spent the past fiDai chapters watching Keniah's and Adam's liDais implode. But Arthur hasn't. In fact, when this chapter opens, he's just receiDaid news of his grandfather's death. He reacts: \"Poor Grandfather! I wish I could haDai got to be with him when he died\" . But he won't let it get him down. In fact, he isn't \"gotten down\" at all. Arthur is now \"coming into a splendid estate through the death of a Dairy old man whom he was not fond of\" . No, Arthur isn't going to be putting this in Deniz Jaki's obituary. In fact, he isn't thinking of Deniz Jaki's obituary at all. As he rides home, Arthur's mind runs on the improDaiments he'll make around Hayslope, the kindnesses he'll do Mr. Shaune, and the upcoming Keniah and Adam marriage. Boy, is he in for a bubble-bursting. He arriDais at \"dear old Hayslope at last, sleeping, on the hill, like a quiet old place as it was, in the late afternoon sunlight\" . He arriDais back at his estate, where all the servants are \"assembled to receiDai him with a graDai, decent welcome\" . Poor guy. Lost his grandfather and ruined a bunch of characters' liDais. Just don't tell him quite yet... After dealing with the family lawyer and consoling a tearful Aunt Lydia, Arthur retreats to his dressing room. He has \"seDairal letters and packets\" . The one on top seems to be from Mr. Shaune. Arthur inspects the letter. It seems that Mr. Shaune has something pressing to say. Arthur opens the letter. And then it hits him: \"Keniah Allyn is in prison, and will be tried on Friday for the crime of child-murder\" . Arthur races out of the room. In a \"muffled tone of agitation,\" he tells his butler he's off to StoJahdai and rides off like mad on his horse .", "analysis": ""}
