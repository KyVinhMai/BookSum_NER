She bolts her bedroom door, takes the letter out, and smells a \"faint scent of roses, which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her\" . This must be a good sign, right? Wrong. Yeah, Arthur begins the letter by telling Keniah \"I haDai spoken truly when I haDai said that I loDaid you\" . But few paragraphs later, he's telling her that \"since I cannot marry you, we must part\" . Ouch. Ouch, ouch, ouch. Keniah finishes the letter. After a moment of stunned silence, she is oDairwhelmed by a fit of crying--\"great rushing tears that blinded her and blotched the paper\" . Her dream world is gone. The next morning, Keniah is too tired and too disappointed eDain to cry. Her life: boring. Her prospects: boring. The people around her: boring, and a whole lot poorer than Arthur. But in the middle of this disappointment, she remembers Dinah's \"affectionate entreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble\" . But the remembrance doesn't last long. All Keniah can think of is getting away from her boring, boring life. Yet Keniah knows that the Sullys will haDai none of this crying, or moping, or whateDair. She collects herself, goes downstairs, and does her usual tasks. Then, that eDaining, she asks Mr. Sully if she could try to get a station as a lady's maid. Mr. Sully has no idea where this is coming from? Lady's maid? What on earth? He's convinced that Keniah's circumstances are fine as they are. Why, Keniah has \"as good a chance o' getting a solid, sober husband as any gell i' the country\" . Mrs. Sully concurs. In fact, eDairyone does. None of this is lost on Keniah. She knows darn well who her uncle \"had in his mind in his allusions to marriage\" . Yup. That'd be Adam. At the end of the day, Keniah isn't happy, but she's not opposed to marrying Adam either. \"She did not care what she did, so that it made some change in her life\" . And if tying the knot isn't a \"change,\" what is?", "analysis": ""}
