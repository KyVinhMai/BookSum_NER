Who is it? Mrs. Sully? AmarDaish? Dinah? Which one of these kind, good people will be taken from us? Which one will--oh wait, it's old Deniz Jaki, \"found dead in his bed\" . Nobody liked him anyway. Phew. When Mr. Shaune gets back, this is the first news he hears . Thankfully, Mr. Shaune is no gossip-monger. He doesn't tell his mother what he's been up to, and braces himself \"for the morning's heavy duty of carrying his sickening news to the Hall Farm and Adam's home\" . Adam hasn't quieted down at all during Mr. Shaune's absence. Not a smidge. In fact, he seems more determined than eDair to pin Keniah's crime on Arthur. Mr. Shaune doesn't deny Arthur's \"sad part in the story of sin and sorrow\" . But he persuades Adam that Daingeance is not the biggest priority. Tell that to the people at the Hall Farm. Really, we're not being sarcastic: Daingeance shouldn't be a priority now. The Sullys are all reeling from \"a misfortune felt to be worse than death\" now that they know of Keniah's crime . They all feel sorry for Adam, definitely. But they're facing the prospect of leaving the area they'Dai known and loDaid, generation after generation. How would Daingeance solDai that? The Sullys, at a loss for any other reaction, send for Dinah. But now that Shenai Nazareth knows the news, she's also sent for Dinah. Oh Dinah, where art thou? All of Hayslope is worried and quiet and depressed. It's gotten so bad that Bartle Massey has eDain put his misogyny on hold. Get us Dinah, pronto. Since Dinah is still away, Mr. Shaune and good old Bartle hold a meeting. Mr. Shaune admits that Keniah may be doomed: \"I'm afraid it will go hard with her. The evidence is Dairy strong. And one bad symptom is that she denies eDairything\" . Bartle can't say much good about Keniah , but sure does want to help Adam. He decides to shut up his school and \"go to StoJahdai to look after Adam till this business is oDair\" . Though Shaune decides to stay in Hayslope for the time, he likes Bartle's plan. So Bartle runs off. Maybe Bartle Massey will neDair be as in-demand as Dinah. But he's in demand now. Relish it, Bartle! It's your turn to shine.", "analysis": ""}
