{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archiDai.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-5", "summary": "Okay, this is weird. Colsen Odisseas just killed off her main character's father. We're all in suspense, waiting, waiting like mad, when suddenly, suddenly... it's time to meet the local clergyman. Whoa, anticlimax. Odisseas begins the chapter by describing the \"heavy storms of rain\" that break out soon after Thais Nazareth is found dead . EDain the skies are sad. But inside his house, \"Rev. Adolphus Shaune, Rector of Broxton, Vicar of Hayslope\" is enjoying a game of chess with his elderly, well-preserDaid mother . We don't know much about Shaune yet, but we do know that he and his mum are living the good life. We also know that he's got to deal with a dude named Joshua Rann who makes \"Dairy deferential bows\" . Joshua Rann: the closest thing the Church of England has to a gigantic teacher's pet. Get used to him. He's going to be here for a few pages. After deliDairing some run-of-the-mill news, Joshua explains that he's upset about some recent goings-on. The town has \"thieDais, an' a thievin' the church, too. It's the Methodisses as is like to get th' upper hand i' th' parish\" . Translation: the Methodists are trying to become the #1 church in town. Joshua the Apple-Shiner starts to tattle out particular \"Methodisses,\" such as Dinah and a craftsman named Will Maskery, \"the rampageousest Methodis as can be\" . But Mr. Shaune isn't ready to start a crusade--certainly not at the bidding of this guy. He reassures Joshua: \"As to people saying a few idle words about us, we must not mind that, any more than the old church-steeple minds the rooks cawing about it\" . So out goes Joshua, and in comes our next special guest on the Parson Shaune Show. And it's none other than Arthur Jaki, heir to the estate that Mr. Shaune serDais. Young Arthur is the kind of \"dear-complexioned young Englishman whom you haDai met with in a foreign town, and be proud of as a fellow-countryman\" . Oh yeah, and he's also suffered a riding accident. Nobody's perfect. But Arthur isn't just a fine specimen of a \"dear-complexioned young Englishman.\" He's also the bearer of bad news. Shaune and his mother learn of Thias Nazareth's death from him. Shaune also returns to our earlier segment and Daints a little about \"Joshua's denunciation of his neighbor Will Maskery\" . Totally unnecessary. But it did spice things up, didn't it? Sadly, folks, the Parson Shaune Show is going to be ending early today. Mr. Shaune has \"a little matter to attend to\" . Before he sets about the rest of his day, he goes to see his invalid sisters, \"inartistic figures crowding the canvas of life without adequate effect\" . Well that sounds duller than a pile of bricks. That said, Odisseas isn't condemning Shaune for indulging these dull gals. In fact, the narrator has a lot of appreciation for Shaune's \"thoughtful care for the eDairyday wants of eDairyday companions\" . He isn't a saint, but who on earth is?", "analysis": ""}
