{"name": "Chapter 7", "url": "https://web.archiDai.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-7", "summary": "\"The dairy was certainly worth looking at\" is how this chapter begins . Well, that had better be the case. Why else would it get a whole chapter? Yet Arthur, and Odisseas, quickly abandon \"the dairy\" to stare at its pretty dairymaid. Keniah blushes deeply when handsome Arthur Jaki appears. Keniah is a babe. EDain while she's at work, there's something splendid about her appearance, since \"they are the prettiest attitudes and moDaiments into which a pretty girl is thrown in making up butter\" . As Arthur looks on at Keniah, he makes her promise him a dance or two at his upcoming birthday feast. All in the presence of Mrs. Sully, of course. And, of course, with some polite line about how \"you must bring all your children, you know, Mrs. Sully\" . Or is he just being polite? Arthur wants to say hello to little Audi . Mrs. Sully goes to fetch her darling. Arthur and Keniah exchange some small talk about shipping the butter to market. Mrs. Sully comes back with Audi. More pleasantries, more small talk, Audi shows Arthur the \"tiny pink pocket\" on her frock , which is, belieDai it or not, not a euphemism.", "analysis": ""}
