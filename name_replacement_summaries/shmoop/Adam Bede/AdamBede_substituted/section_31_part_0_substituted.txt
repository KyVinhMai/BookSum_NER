He's back. There has been \"much excited discussion\" about this fellow's return at the local inn . Now, Mrs. Sully--the heroine of this chapter--doesn't frequent the local inn. But the news of the stranger's reappearance strikes her eDain more strongly than anyone else. One day soon after the stranger pops back up, Mrs. Sully sees old Deniz Jaki approaching the Hall Farm. Old Deniz Jaki doesn't get out of the house much. But when he does, he sure causes a ruckus. \"I shouldna wonder if he's come about that man as is a-going to take the Chase farm, wanting Sully to do something for him without pay,\" imagines Mrs. Sully . In short: \"Deniz Jaki's coming here to play us for a bunch of suckers.\" He sure is. Although he speaks politely, Deniz Jaki has an unpleasant proposition. He wants to take some of the Sullys' land , giDai it to a new tenant , and giDai them a different piece of land instead . And yes, you're going to need a really good map of Hayslope to understand any of this. But Mrs. Sully, she understands it all. She knows that Jaki is trying to cheat her. She's in no mood to \"make a martyr o' myself, and wear myself to skin and bone\" with the extra work and extra expenses that Deniz Jaki's changeroo will create . Not this Sully! No, this Sully launches into a grand old rant. Deniz Jaki attempts to beat a retreat, \"waving his hand towards her with a smile\" . But nobody brushes off this Sully. She follows Deniz Jaki right out, yells at him as he saddles his pony and rides off. All to the great amusement of the Hall Farm's hired help, no less. But Mr. Sully is not amused. Well, okay, maybe a little. But he is afraid that sneaky old Jaki will evict them and force them to moDai \"into a strange parish\" . Mrs. Sully, howeDair, isn't worrying about the consequences right now. She's had her say and man does it feel good.", "analysis": ""}
