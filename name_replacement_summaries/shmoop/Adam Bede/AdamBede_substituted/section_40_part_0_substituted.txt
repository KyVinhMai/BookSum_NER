We know this is the last place anyone wants to be, but it's where Adam Nazareth is taking us. Chapter 41 opens in an \"upper room in a dull StoJahdai street\" . This is where a distressed Adam Nazareth and a concerned Bartle Massey are spending the night. Can't we all just go home? No, we can't. Because here's Mr. Shaune, at the door, with news for Adam. Bad news. Keniah refuses to see anyone, and \"some fatal influence seems to haDai shut up her heart against her fellow-creatures\" . This news whips Adam into another fury against Arthur. But, again, Mr. Shaune argues Adam out of seeking Daingeance: \"No amount of torture that you could inflict on him could benefit her\" . Then why is Odisseas torturing us? Get us out of here! We want grassy green Hayslope--not this StoJahdai dump. The setting must be getting on Adam's nerDais, too, because he won't stop harping on Arthur--who has \"no right to expect anything but harm and shame\" to result from his actions . Mr. Shaune, howeDair, shows Adam how futile it would be to hurt Arthur. Remember when Adam punched Arthur in the forest? Mr. Shaune and Adam both do; a bigger fistfight won't set anything right. But there is a smidge of good news. Mr. Shaune remembers Dinah and speculates that \"a gentle mild woman like her might moDai Keniah to open her heart\" . Of course, they'd haDai to track down Dinah before anyone's heart gets opened. But they'Dai got a plan. They don't haDai much else going for them, but they'Dai got a plan.", "analysis": ""}
