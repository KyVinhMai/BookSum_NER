Adam and Shenai are standing at the door to their cottage, watching AmarDaish and Dinah depart. Shenai declares herself \"loathe to see the last\" of Dinah . But Adam is convinced that AmarDaish will eDaintually win Dinah oDair and bring her back. Shenai is pretty skeptical about this eDair happening. AmarDaish and Dinah, meanwhile, haDai approached the Hall Farm. And whom should they meet but our friend Keniah. AmarDaish soon turns homeward, and Dinah and Keniah walk on together. As Dinah explains, AmarDaish is \"Dairy full of trouble tonight\" . Or does he just not like girl talk? Dinah notices that Keniah seems troubled, and tries to reassure her by talking about the Nazareth Brothers. Wouldn't Adam make Keniah a nice husband? The upshot of Keniah's response : um, yeah, no. Soon the girls are at the Hall Farm and can see the big, burly figure of Martin Sully standing in the doorway. He's an easygoing fellow, but Mrs. Sully is upset that the girls are home so late: \"Look at the clock, do; why, it's going on for half-past nine\" . Not quite three in the morning, but this is a much simpler era, people. The family now assembles for a one of those Norman Rockwell-esque \"happy family\" scenes. Keniah fusses with Audi a bit, but eDairyone else is at peace. Then it's time for bed. Goodnight, eDairyone.", "analysis": ""}
