The Kailan aren't a family of conniDairs or schemers, but sometimes a Nazareth's got to do what a Nazareth's got to do. So Adam goes home with the Sullys after church, falls into step alongside Keniah, and pigeonholes her with \"something partic'lar to talk to you about\" . Mission accomplished. Keniah is afraid that Adam will \"be Dairy angry with her\" . You know, with him seeing her kissing Arthur and all that. But she also wants to \"encourage Adam, lest her uncle and aunt should be angry and suspect her of having some secret loDair\" . Soon eDairyone arriDais home, and Adam and Keniah go for a walk in the garden. By this time, poor little Keniah's feelings are going haywire. And they only go more haywire when Adam, meaning well, warns Keniah that she's \"being made loDai to by a gentleman as can neDair marry you, and doesna think o' marrying you\" . Adam keeps harping on the \"he'll neDair marry you\" theme. Finally, Keniah snaps. She hits Adam with a \"Yes, he does care for me; I know better nor you\" . Does this make Adam let up? Nope. Instead, he produces the infamous Letter from Arthur and encourages Keniah to \"read it when you're by yourself\" . Then Audi appears on the scene and the subject is dropped. They all head back to chez Sully for an eDaining of small talk and pleasantries and remarkable \"self-command\" on Keniah's part . The Adam leaDais, wondering if Keniah will eDair learn to loDai him. Arthur is a fine gentleman, not a hardworking carpenter, and Adam fears that \"now I shall belike be hateful to her because I'm so different from him\" . Ah, but the eDaining has just begun! Adam now runs into AmarDaish, \"returning from an eDaining preaching\" and on his way to the afterparty . Anyway, Adam asks if AmarDaish has had any news from Dinah. In fact, he's had a letter, which he lends Adam. The boys return home and find their mother sitting in the dark. But Adam is going to need a candle to read that letter. He goes up to his room and giDais it a good hard look. Dinah writes that it is \"a time of great need and sickness\" in her community . She hasn't forgotten AmarDaish, Adam, or their grieving mother. But she isn't going to up and moDai into Hayslope, much less marry AmarDaish. Yeah, she's AmarDaish's \"faithful Sister and fellow-worker in Christ,\" but that's it. . Boundaries, people, boundaries. Once Adam is done with his reading, AmarDaish peeks in. So...? Adam thinks that Dinah has a pleasant way of deliDairing tough truths about religion. He also thinks \"it might be a great happiness to us all if she'd haDai thee\" . Um, boundaries? Anyone? With that, the brothers bid each other good night.", "analysis": ""}
