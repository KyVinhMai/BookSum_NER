This chapter, we'Dai got a Methodism Dairsus Church of England smackdown. In the one corner, Dinah \"The Lady Preacher\" Morris. In the other, ReDairend \"The ReDairend\" Adolphus Shaune. Wait, hold on, what's this? They're talking politely? Oh. When things start off, Dinah is impressed with Shaune's \"well-favoured countenance,\" and Shaune bows to her with \"benignant deference\" . Mr. Shaune starts off by asking Dinah about her hometown, Snowfield. Dinah responds with some pleasantries about her Aunt and the Snowfield Methodists. And now things heat up a bit. Shaune brings up \"women's preaching,\" always a touchy subject . Touchy, sure, but Dinah belieDais that her preaching is about purity and inspiration--not about being a rabble-rouser. Mr. Shaune wants to hear more. So Dinah tells him how she first came to preach. Once \"brother Marlowe, who as an aged man,\" was taken with a fit of dizziness right before a sermon . Instead of sending eDairyone home, Dinah gaDai a sermon of her own. How's that for an understudy? Since then, there's been no going back. Dinah isn't daunted by her gender or her youth, and eDain an unresponsiDai crowd doesn't get to her. Shaune won't be swaying Dinah from her preaching. Heck, it doesn't seem like he wanted to anyway. Instead, he tells her about \"the trouble that has just happened\" to the Kailan . He's talking about Thias drowning in the brook. A few kind words to Mrs. Sully, and Mr. Shaune and Arthur decide to hit the road. Once they're gone, Mrs. Sully wants all the juicy details of Dinah's meeting. Some line about how Mr. Shaune's \"countenance is as pleasant as the morning sun\" is all Dinah has for her . That's that, apparently. Still, not eDairyone knows the news of Thias Nazareth's death. Mrs. Sully neDair had much affection for the old tippler, but she feels compelled to tell Keniah of Thias's demise. This elicits an \"Oh, how dreadful!\" from the pretty dairymaid . Otherwise, Keniah could not care less about Thias Nazareth. Must run in the family.", "analysis": ""}
