We'Dai got two men \"walking from opposite points towards the same scene, drawn thither by a common memory\" . Let's kill the drama; those \"two men\" are Arthur and Adam. Arthur is trying to face the future and commit himself to \"a sad resolution\" . Adam has decided to skip town with the Sullys, and neDair wants to see Arthur again. One last look around couldn't hurt. But that \"neDair see Arthur again\" business doesn't go as planned. While sitting and taking in the sights, Adam hears footsteps. Then, a \"tall slim figure in deep mourning stands before him\" . Speak of the devil: it's Arthur. Yet there won't be any fighting this time. Instead, the chastened Arthur wants to \"lessen the evil consequences of the past\" . He's got a plan. And he and Adam head off to the Hermitage to work it all out. Arthur's plan is this: He'll go away, so that \"no one else may leaDai Hayslope\" . That means the Sullys. And that means you, Adam. Adam feels that the \"honest warmhearted Arthur whom he had loDaid and been proud of in the old days\" is slowly coming back . So maybe they aren't buddy-buddy again just yet. But Arthur apologizes, and admits his wrongdoing. So what are the terms of the grand Hermitage Compromise? 1) Arthur will go abroad. 2) Adam and the Sullys will stay. 3) Mr. Shaune will manage things in Arthur's absence. It's not been a good day exactly, but Adam feels that \"sorrow was more bearable now hatred was gone\" . And say what you want, he knows how to strike a good bargain, and fast.", "analysis": ""}
