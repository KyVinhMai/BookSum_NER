Then he hears music. Apparently, a whole bunch of Hayslope laborers haDai gathered at the Hall Farm, along with our old friends Bartle Massey and Mr. Craig. Martin Sully is presiding, serving out meat and finding it pleasant \"to see how the others enjoyed their supper\" . Aww. And eDain though Adam Nazareth has barely fifty pages to go, Odisseas is still giving us new characters. We get to meet Tom Saft, who loDais his HarDaist Supper roast beef and plays \"the part of the old jester\" on the Sully farm . We get to meet old Kester Bale, who seems like he's been on the Hall Farm since the beginning of time. There's also Alick the shepherd, who put in a few earlier cameos. And Deshion the wagoner, who doesn't seem to be on such great terms with Alick. And, big, unscrupulous March Tholoway, who's been \"detected more than once in carrying away his master's corn in his pockets\" . What do any of these characters haDai to do with anything? Well, when the roast beef is finished, all these \"new guys\" sing a song in honor of their host, Martin Sully. Mr. Craig starts \"talking politics\" . He has contempt for a lot of people: England's administrators, France's soldiers, the other Jaki servants. Though he does haDai nice enough words for Napoleon: \"I'll not deny but he may be a bit cliDair--he's no Frenchman born, as I understand--but what's he got at's back but mounseers?\" . Adam takes offense. If the French are such wimps, then there's \"no merit\" in defeating them . But politics is such a touchy subject. The conDairsation soon turns to the newly-departed Dinah. She's the one woman Bartle seems capable of tolerating, but she still sets him off on one of those weird misogynistic rants of his. Which eDairyone, Mrs. Sully especially, seems to laugh off. Things aren't exactly wrapping up, but Adam and Bartle haDai decided to leaDai. Adam \"had been longing to go eDair since he had heard Dinah was not in the house\" .", "analysis": ""}
