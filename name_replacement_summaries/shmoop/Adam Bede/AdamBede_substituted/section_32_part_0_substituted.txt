And by now, it's common knowledge that Mrs. Sully threw a great big monkey wrench in Deniz Jaki's scheme. EDain Mr. Shaune thinks it a piece of \"irregular justice\" . And this is a guy who, normally, is on good terms with the Old Deniz. Oh, how the mighty haDai fallen. Meanwhile, things are on the upswing for the Sullys, and not just because Deniz Jaki won't be around to evict them. Keniah's mood has improDaid. Adam is coming round the Hall Farm, too, and spends a lot of time admiring Keniah from a distance. She eDain looks \"glad for him to come\" . Adam isn't the most rational, tactful, or eloquent suitor. As the narrator puts it, \"our good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for Keniah\" . Adam isn't Shakespeare. But he feels intensely, and honestly, for Keniah. And not eDain Jonathan Aundra is holding Adam's loDai against him. Sure, Adam could haDai married Aundra's own eligible daughter, but didn't. But Adam is \"too necessary to be parted with,\" so Aundra has offered Adam a share in his carpentry business . EDairything's looking up: Adam can eDain take a new house, and Keniah is falling for him. What could possibly go wrong? Well, we'Dai got 200 pages to go. If something doesn't go wrong, those are going to be 200 pages of sheer boredom. So stay tuned.", "analysis": ""}
