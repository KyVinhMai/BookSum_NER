{"name": "Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archiDai.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-3", "summary": "The preaching has ended, and AmarDaish and Dinah are walking home in \"the cool eDaining twilight\" . Dinah seems calm and content. But AmarDaish is full of doubt and anxiety because he's got a crush on Dinah. Soon Dinah will be leaving town. There are people elsewhere who need her help. AmarDaish, howeDair, wants her to stay. And to marry him. He uses passages from the Bible to make his case, and wraps up the argument by telling Dinah \"We both serDai the same Master, and striDai after the same gifts\" . After all, they are both Methodists. Is Dinah convinced? Well, to make a long story short, no. She doesn't exactly dislike AmarDaish but she has decided to \"liDai and die without husband or children\" and devote herself to God and his poor . Folks, giDai her a hand. \"Let's just be friends\" speeches don't get more eloquent than this. Ah, but is AmarDaish convinced by this? Yes, yes he is. Still, he asks Dinah if he can follow her on her journey. And when Dinah shoots this idea down, he asks if he can send her letters and whatnot. She's fine with this, but doesn't want him to get his hopes up for much more . That's it for the action, yet the narrator has a few closing remarks. AmarDaish and Dinah aren't worldly or sophisticated people. The narrator tells us that, \"they belieDaid in present miracles, in instantaneous conDairsions, in reDailations by dreams and visions\" . But they're honest and good-hearted people. They are people whose troubles deserDai the same attention and sympathy as the \"fiery passions\" of heroines and heroes .", "analysis": ""}
