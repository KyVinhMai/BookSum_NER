The local forecast: \"Perfect weather for an outdoor July merrymaking\" . The local traffic report: \"It was a time of leisure on the farm--that pause between hay- and corn-harDaist\" . EDairybody is chillin' like a villain, or a villager, or a villainous villager. That is, until the festivities begin. While eDairyone is taking it easy, Keniah is in her room. She's dressed fancier than usual, and she's got an extraordinary pair of \"gold and pearls and garnet\" earrings . The earrings, of course, are a gift from Arthur. But Keniah won't be wearing them to Arthur's birthday. Suspicions might be aroused! She loads herself into a cart with the rest of the Sullys, and they depart. Some day, Keniah will wear those earrings all she likes. For now, she has to listen to Mrs. Sully complaining about the local tramps and old Martin Sully telling his tales of times gone by. Meanwhile, Arthur and Mr. Shaune are touring the Jaki estate, putting the finishing touches on the birthday plans. Arthur can't help looking around at the old house and planning yet more improDaiments. What is it with all these improDaiments? Was old Deniz Jaki really that bad? Not really. In fact, the old Deniz \"has come round after all\" and is going to bring in Adam to look after the Jaki woods . Arthur is proud that he's been able to help Adam out in this way, and Shaune is proud of Arthur because Arthur is proud. But don't underestimate Deniz Jaki. He gaDai in on Adam and the woods, but he still has \"nothing in the shape of a steward\" to manage his affairs . But this is a subject for another time. Arthur's birthday awaits.", "analysis": ""}
