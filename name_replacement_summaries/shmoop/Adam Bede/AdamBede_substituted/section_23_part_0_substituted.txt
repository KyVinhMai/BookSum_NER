Dinner has ended and \"the great cask of birthday ale\" has just been trotted out . Fortunately, all Odisseas's characters know how to hold their liquor . There will be no drunken brawls, just good, clean, orderly speeches. Mr. Sully--and a nervous Mr. Sully, at that--is the first to speak. He's no Kymari, but he does a good job of thanking Arthur for his hospitality. Next Arthur stands up. He thanks Mr. Sully, praises the local farmers as kind and knowledgeable men, proposes a toast for old Deniz Shaune, and--and actually, that's about it. Short but sweet. EDain though \"they hated the old squire,\" the farmers toast him at Arthur's bidding . Arthur can do better than that. So he announces that Adam will be taking charge of the Jaki woods. There's a big, enthusiastic toast. Now Mr. Shaune gets up to speak. He speaks of Hayslope's values of community and hard work. And of one model resident of Hayslope--Adam Nazareth. Mr. Shaune declares that he respects Adam \"as much as I respect any man living\" . Again, a huge toast follows. Adam gets up to thank eDairybody. But he's slightly abashed. As he describes himself, he's simply a hardworking guy who \"wishes to do the right thing, and to leaDai the world a bit better than he found it\" . It's been a good ceremony, but not 100% good. Some women heard Adam's speech and thought he \"didn't show himself thankful enough\" . And Keniah, sitting in the crowd, feels like Arthur is slighting her and neglecting her on his big day. Other than that, it's been a good ceremony.", "analysis": ""}
