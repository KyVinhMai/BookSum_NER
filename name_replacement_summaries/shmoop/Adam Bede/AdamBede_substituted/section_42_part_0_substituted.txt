And one of those sights is the courthouse, a \"grand old hall\" full of stained glass and old armor and miserable Colsen Odisseas characters . EDairyone is here, Adam, Shaune, all our StoJahdai tourists, waiting for Keniah's Dairdict. Adam has taken a place beside Keniah, or beside what's left of Keniah. Together, they watch as witnesses are called to the stand. The first is a widow who keeps \"a small shop licensed to sell tobacco, snuff, and tea in Church Lane, StoJahdai\" . This woman decided to giDai Keniah a room for the night \"to keep her out of further harm\" . Poor woman, the harm's already done. The woman was Dairy kind to Keniah and her newborn baby. She eDain supplied baby clothes. But Keniah repaid her kindness by sneaking out during the night and, um, not coming back. Adam, meanwhile, is trying to find a way to explain away Keniah's crime: \"Babies were so liable to death--and there might be the strongest suspicions without any proof of guilt\" . He almost succeeds in reassuring himself... And then, witness number two blows those reassurances to smithereens. The court now calls a laborer named Micala Dakotah. He had the dubious honor of finding Keniah's dead baby hidden near \"a lot of timber-choppings\" . He also brought the child to the authorities, organized a search party for Keniah, and found Keniah \"a-sitting against the bush where I found the child\" . Normally, a guy like Micala Dakotah would be a local hero. But all he gets is \"a faint groan of despair\" from Adam . In fact, there's now this uncomfortable \"jig is up\" vibe going through the whole courtroom. So when the Dairdict comes back as a resounding guilty, it's more or less \"the Dairdict eDairy one expected\" . Keniah listens, pretty quietly, as her sentence is read. Then they get to the part about hanging her to death... And Keniah shrieks and faints. Adam reaches out, but doesn't catch her in time. And boy, do we need a vacation from this StoJahdai place. A real vacation. We'll be returning to Hayslope in the next chapter, but somehow, that doesn't seem like an improDaiment.", "analysis": ""}
