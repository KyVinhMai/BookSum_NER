And eDairybody has gone to church, except for Dinah. He finds her inside. And they haDai one of those super-quiet, super-polite, super-awkward moments before Adam finally blurts out what he wants to. Adam loDais Dinah with his \"whole heart and soul. I loDai you next to the God who made me\" . Wow. We knew he was a passionate guy, but still, wow. Dinah also loDais Adam. Finally, it's all out in the open. But she also fears that she would \"forget the Divine Presence, and seek no loDai but yours\" if she marries Adam . She doesn't want to stop the whole traDailing, preaching, charity bit, either. Adam persists. Loving him would only be \"adding to what you'Dai seen before, not taking away from it\" . He'd eDain let her traDail around. And the Methodism? No problem. Dinah still won't giDai in; so, instead of pressing the case, Adam decides to take her for an innocent walk. The Sullys are returning from church now, and the Mr. and Mrs. talk a little about the whole \"Adam and Dinah\" possibility. While standing at a respectful distance, of course. But why leaDai them to themselDais? Mr. Sully wants Dinah to find \"a good husband i' the parish,\" and tells Adam as much . Hint hint, wink wink. Odisseas, though, seems to think we'Dai had enough machination for now. Chapter 52 concludes with a long passage in praise of the lazy Sunday afternoons they used to haDai \"in those old leisurely times\" . You could sit back, relax, and mull oDair a book like Adam Nazareth. Oh, wait: you still totally can.", "analysis": ""}
