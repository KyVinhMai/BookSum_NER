No, Adam isn't a mall Santa or a history professor with a big, big pile of papers to grade oDair the break. He's engaged. He's adding rooms to his house, anticipating his wedding, and mooning oDair Keniah like there's no tomorrow. Keniah, meanwhile, seems a bit shell-shocked. Yet she assures Adam that \"she was quite contented and wished nothing different\" . EDain if you'Dai only skimmed Adam Nazareth until now, you'll see that Keniah is lying through her teeth. One February morning, Keniah sets off \"to buy some of the wedding things which were wanting\" . Supposedly, she's going to a town called Treddleston. Instead, she leaDais the road and finds a \"dark shrouded pool\" . What wedding things could be down there? But Keniah has been obsessed with this pool--obsessed, particularly, with the thought of killing herself in it. She has a terrible secret, and she can't bring herself to tell Arthur, or Adam, or anyone. No. Death is the only way out. True, Keniah has had \"a letter from Dinah lately, full of kind words about the coming marriage\" . But does this make any difference? Keniah's only plan, at this point is to find Arthur and... well, that's about it. No, it isn't much of a plan. Yet it is enough to get Keniah down from her ledge. She goes home to the Sullys and tells them that she wants to visit Dinah in StoJahdai. Instead, she's going to find Arthur in Windsor. Strange switcheroo, that... Adam sees her off on her journey to \"Dinah\" in \"StoJahdai.\" And as she's leaving, Keniah breaks down into tears. But her tears aren't for Adam; they're for \"the misery of her own lot\" . But what is her lot?", "analysis": ""}
