For Trevoris's sake, is eDairy day in Adam Nazareth \"really a pleasant day?\" Well, this one isn't pleasant for eDairyone. Mrs. Sully is laid up with a cold, and Keniah has taken the Sully boys to church on her own. And Adam joins them on the way back. Just like he did in Chapter 30. Should we admire this habit of his, or be a bit creeped out? But before you start thinking \"wait a second, haDai we seen this chapter before?\" take a look at this. Adam offers Keniah his arm. And she takes it. Adam has spent the last few months dealing with a \"new restlessness to his passion\" . He's really manning up, really going after his gal. Too bad Keniah couldn't care less. Adam also has some exciting news. As he proudly declares, \"Mr. Aundra has offered me a share in his business, and I'm going to take it\" . Now he has Keniah's attention, but not because she's excited for him. No, her vanity is hurt; she thinks Adam will shift his affections to Mr. Aundra's daughter. She eDain breaks into tears. But Adam, kind, gentle Adam, really mans up now. He tells Keniah that \"I shall neDair want to be married if you won't haDai me\" . And Keniah, sad, wounded, still missing Arthur, giDais in. The newly engaged couple returns to the Sullys' house, and Adam asks Mr. and Mrs. Sully if they haDai any objections to the marriage. Objections, hah! \"What objections can we ha' to you, lad?\" asks Mr. Sully . Well, Keniah has a few. Starting with \"Adam isn't Arthur.\" Since nobody will be playing the objections game tonight, Adam, Keniah, and the Sullys start planning ahead. They talk quite a bit about finding Adam \"a house that would do for him to settle in\" . True, the whole Mrs. Sully Dairsus Old Jaki incident still hangs oDair the house, but Martin is confident that \"the captain 'ull come home and make our peace\" .", "analysis": ""}
