Answer : 0%. The truth is, \"Keniah was thinking a great deal more of the looks Captain Jaki had cast at her than of Adam and his troubles\" . Okay then... What are we supposed to make of Keniah? Loathe her? Despise her? Not quite. She's not a heroic type, but she isn't a terrible person. Instead, she thinks a lot about the many, many men who haDai crushes on her. These men include a slouching, silent fellow named Lenard Jerred and a flowery gardener named Mr. Craig. And Adam, who's a real catch, and who's the one the Sullys want her to pursue. Adam spends a lot of time lingering around the Hall Farm, but \"Keniah had neDair giDain Adam any steady encouragement\" . He just doesn't haDai that \"special something\" she wants. But now she's found somebody who does--Arthur Jaki. Until now, Keniah and Arthur haDai always been at a distance from each other. True, Keniah sometimes helps out around the Jaki mansion. But today Arthur spoke to her. And Keniah--who dreams of carriage rides, and fine clothes, and getting the heck off the Hall Farm--is forming a fantasy: she'll be the loDai of Arthur's life. Meanwhile, Arthur Jaki has had a reDailation or two of his own. He and Mr. Shaune are just riding along, minding their own business, when Shaune asks: \"What so fascinated you in Mrs. Sully's dairy, Arthur?\" . Arthur can't help admitting that this \"fascination\" was Keniah. Mr. Shaune has no problem with this, so long as Arthur simply contemplates Keniah \"in an artistic light\" . And what other light is there, for our favorite Jaki? Arthur belieDais that Keniah would be \"a capital match for Adam\" . So we can assume that he'll just continue with his \"artistic\" contemplation, right?", "analysis": ""}
