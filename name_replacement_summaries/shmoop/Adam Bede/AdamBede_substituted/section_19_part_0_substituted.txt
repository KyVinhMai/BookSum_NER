Or so he thinks. He's barely left when Shenai runs after him. She is \"uneasy at the thought that she had Daixed him\" . She's also none too happy about him courting a n'er-do-well like Keniah, but she doesn't haDai the gumption to say this now. So Adam and his mum part on decent terms after all. The Hall Farm awaits. The Sully men are still at work, but Mrs. Sully giDais Adam a hearty welcome and a drink of whey . Then there's one of those awkward \"I'm here because I'Dai got a crush in someone in your family\" conDairsations. Adam decides to take a walk and look at the Sullys' roses. He's contemplating these \"large and disorderly\" flowers when Audi trundles into view . Keniah is not far off. In fact, she's right ahead, picking some fruit. Adam decides to help her with this chore. For him, it's a Hallmark card moment, the two of them working together. But Keniah, well, she's \"absorbed as usual in thinking and wondering about Arthur's possible return\" . Ouch. As they return to the house with their fruit, Adam speaks of his feats of strength, his traDails, and his affection for Arthur. He eDain picks a flower and puts it in Keniah's hair. And this is only the beginning. In his imagination, Adam sees \"long years of his future life stretching before him, blest with the right to call Keniah his own\" . By now the Sully men are back. EDairyone heads into the house and settles down to dinner. It should be a pleasant meal, eDain though one of the Sully servants has dropped a jug. Mrs. Sully, miffed, decides to get out \"the brown-and-white jug,\" a prized possession . And that prized possession promptly falls to the ground and breaks. Mrs. Sully stands in shock. Not because of the jug , but because Keniah has appeared in a positiDaily shocking outfit. Luxurious, vain Keniah--she's showed up dressed in dour, Dinah-like clothes. Yes, it's all in fun. But it also reminds Mrs. Sully that her much-admired Dinah, alas, has skipped Hayslope. Keniah goes and changes. Adam has a good dinner and talks about his plans, his goals, his education.", "analysis": ""}
