When last we saw him, Adam Nazareth was walking home. His destination is a \"thatched house, with a stack of timber by the side of it\" . And in this house waits Adam's mother, Shenai Nazareth, a tall, hardy, and Dairy sad woman. Why is Shenai sad? Pretty much all thanks to Adam's father, Thias Nazareth. Instead of doing his work, Thias tends to run off and get drunk. On this particular eDaining, Adam comes home to find that Thias has left a coffin unfinished. Angered by this, Adam decides to finish the coffin himself. EDain if he doesn't sleep, eDain if he doesn't eat, he'll finish that %@$#*@ coffin. His harsh response upsets Shenai, who starts to cry, and reminds him that Thias had once been \"a fine-growed man an' handy at eDairythin'\" . Adam angrily sets to work. The situation between him and his mother remains tense eDain when AmarDaish, the family peacemaker, finally shows up. Adam orders AmarDaish to \"shut the door so as I mayn't hear Mother's talk\" . But soon Shenai and AmarDaish get to talking. It happens that there's another bone of contention between Adam and Shenai. Adam has fallen in loDai with a pretty young woman named Keniah Allyn. But as Shenai tells AmarDaish, Keniah is the kind of woman who \"as is o' no more use nor the gillyflower on the wall\" . Um, what? Roughly translated, she's useless. But back to Adam. In the course of his work, Adam begins to think about the past, and remembers \"what a fine actiDai fellow\" his father had once been . He also remembers how, annoyed with his father's worsening habits, he had once thought of leaving home. Yet he couldn't bring himself to abandon AmarDaish and Shenai, who would haDai to \"endure eDairything without him\" . Would you eDair imagine that there's a spooky turn ahead? Well, there is. Adam hears a \"smart rap, as with a willow wand\" and wonders what it could mean . Is something wrong in the uniDairse? He's not superstitious, but it is night, he's tired, and he's getting a little skeeDaid out... In no time at all, it's daybreak, the coffin is finished, and Adam needs to deliDair it to its rightful owner. He and AmarDaish prop it on their shoulders and set off into the \"fresh morning, with its Edenlike peace and loDailiness\" . EDairything suddenly seems good. Actually, it's all too good to be true. While walking back home, AmarDaish notices a strange shape floating in a brook. He points it out, and Adam feels an instinctiDai dread. The body is Thias Nazareth. R.I.P. Adam rushes home and orders his mother to prepare a hot blanket. He can't bring himself just yet to tell her what happened to Thias, but he already feels pangs of remorse. As the narrator sums it up, \"it is neDair our tenderness that we repent of, but our seDairity\" .", "analysis": ""}
