And everybody has gone to church, except for Dinah. He finds her inside. And they have one of those super-quiet, super-polite, super-awkward moments before Adam finally blurts out what he wants to. Adam loves Dinah with his \"whole heart and soul. I love you next to the God who made me\" . Wow. We knew he was a passionate guy, but still, wow. Dinah also loves Adam. Finally, it's all out in the open. But she also fears that she would \"forget the Divine Presence, and seek no love but yours\" if she marries Adam . She doesn't want to stop the whole traveling, preaching, charity bit, either. Adam persists. Loving him would only be \"adding to what you've seen before, not taking away from it\" . He'd even let her travel around. And the Methodism? No problem. Dinah still won't give in; so, instead of pressing the case, Adam decides to take her for an innocent walk. The Poysers are returning from church now, and the Mr. and Mrs. talk a little about the whole \"Adam and Dinah\" possibility. While standing at a respectful distance, of course. But why leave them to themselves? Mr. Poyser wants Dinah to find \"a good husband i' the parish,\" and tells Adam as much . Hint hint, wink wink. Eliot, though, seems to think we've had enough machination for now. Chapter 52 concludes with a long passage in praise of the lazy Sunday afternoons they used to have \"in those old leisurely times\" . You could sit back, relax, and mull over a book like Adam Bede. Oh, wait: you still totally can.", "analysis": ""}
