{"name": "Chapter 39", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-39", "summary": "Might as well call this chapter \"Fear and Loathing in Broxton Parsonage.\" Reeling from \"the double suffering of certain and uncertain sorrow,\" Adam has tracked down Mr. Irwine, the one person in Hayslope who seems to have all the answers . Or enough of them, anyway. Adam is shown into Mr. Irwine's study. The good clergyman has a new, disturbing expression--\"strangely different from the warm friendliness it had always worn for him before\" . Irwine's nerves are clearly shot. And no, one of those Chapter 16 \"big breakfasts\" won't solve this one. Adam explains that Hetty is gone, he doesn't know where, he doesn't know why. Mr. Irwine does. But first, Adam vents his grievances toward Arthur, who \"played with Hetty's feelings, and behaved to her as he'd no right to do to a girl in her station o' life\" . This outburst gives Mr. Irwine time to collect his thoughts. He calmly informs Adam that a \"heavier sorrow\" will soon be upon him . And then the cold, hard facts: Hetty is in prison, for child-murder. Adam has two reactions. First, you think he was angry at Arthur before? Well, now Adam makes the Incredible Hulk look like a mild-mannered guy. And second, Adam can't bring himself to believe that Hetty is guilty. Mr. Irwine does his best to calm Adam down, and offers some practical advice: \"See what good can be done for her, instead of going on a useless errand of vengeance\" . There is going to be lots of trouble ahead; the Poysers, after all, are still in the dark. Still, Adam is determined to help Mr. Irwine. Putting on a V for Vendetta mask and hunting down Arthur--stuff like that can wait.", "analysis": ""}
