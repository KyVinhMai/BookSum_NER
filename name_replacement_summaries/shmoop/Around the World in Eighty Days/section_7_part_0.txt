Passepartout tells Fix that he and his master are going on a super-fast journey and that he never gets a minute to stop and see the sights. Passepartout accepts the detective's offer to help him find some shirts and shoes for himself and his master. Passepartout tells Fix about his watch, which is a family heirloom, noting that he always keeps it on London time, no matter where he is. Fix tells him to set his watch to the correct time in each country, but Passepartout refuses. Passepartout tells Fix that Fogg is making the journey around the world because of a bet. Passepartout does not really believe his master will go through with it, though, and he tells Fix that Fogg is rich, but no one really knows how or why. This increases Fix's suspicions that Phileas Fogg is the bank robber in question.", "analysis": ""}
