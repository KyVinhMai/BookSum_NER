They are presented in front of a judge, and several priests are brought in. Fogg assumes they are the priests who tried to kill Aouda but they are actually the ones who punched out Passepartout in Bombay for entering the temple. Detective Fix sent the priests on the next train to Calcutta in order to try to get Fogg and Passepartout arrested. The judge rules that Passepartout and Fogg must serve fifteen days in prison and pay a fine of three hundred pounds. Fogg pays bail for himself and his servant, and the money isn't anything to sneeze at. They go straight to the Rangoon, the ship that was to leave for Hong Kong. Detective Fix is pretty ticked because his plan didn't work, and he assumes Fogg is spending the money he took from the bank robbery. If Fogg spends everything, there won't be any money left as a reward for his capture.", "analysis": ""}
