Passepartout is curious at first and joins the lecture, but he manages to escape when he finds it extremely boring. At Ogden the train stops and another Mormon man hurries onto the train, having just had a fight at home. Passepartout asks him how many wives he has and the man answers that he only has one. Passepartout finds this different from the other Mormons and possibly a better idea because having more than one wife can be a hot mess.", "analysis": ""}
