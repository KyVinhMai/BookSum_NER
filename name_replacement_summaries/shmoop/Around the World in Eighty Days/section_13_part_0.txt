The elephant continues through the jungle throughout the night as the woman sleeps off the drugs. Sir Francis worries that should the woman remain in India she could be captured again and executed. It would be a good idea to get her out of the country, he thinks, and Phileas Fogg says he'll think about it. The travelers reach the station at Allahabad at ten o'clock. The railway line will take them on to Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours. Passepartout has been made to go shopping for the young woman, who awoke at the station. He takes a look at the city of Allahabad and then returns to the woman, Aouda . She is a \"charming woman\" and speaks English well. Kiouni the elephant is given to the Parsee guide for his help in the daring rescue. Aouda, the rescued woman, is eternally grateful and agrees to come with them on the train. Sir Francis tells her the story of how Fogg stopped to rescue her and how Passepartout made it happen. Fogg offers to take her to Hong Kong where she may find safety in a relative who lives there. Sir Francis is deposited at Benares, and the group continues on to Calcutta. All in all, the group loses the two days they had gained, but Phileas, for once, doesn't regret the loss.", "analysis": ""}
