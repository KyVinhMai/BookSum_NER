He asks the consul to refuse to stamp it, but the consul tells Fix that if the passport is genuine, he can't refuse to stamp it. Fix is hoping that by detaining Phileas at the consul's office he can buy himself enough time to receive the warrant. Passepartout and Fogg do indeed enter the consul's office to get the passport stamped. Fix hides in order to observe them but remain unseen. The consul asks a few questions, but then he stamps and initials the passport and Fogg and Passepartout exit the office. The consul tells Fix that he thinks Phileas Fogg looks like an honest fellow and doesn't think the description of the bank robber can be totally trusted. Fix decides he should keep working on Passepartout since a Frenchman can't resist conversation. Fogg goes back to the steamship Mongolia after giving Passepartout some errands to run. When Fogg returns to his cabin, he systematically inputs information into his travel itinerary. He records the month, date, time, and points of departure in even columns. We learn that his journey will include the following major points: Paris, Brindisi, Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, New York, and London. He does not wish to sightsee and is content to hear about it from Passepartout.", "analysis": ""}
