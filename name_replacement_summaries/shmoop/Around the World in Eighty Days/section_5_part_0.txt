Detective Fix impatiently waits for the steamship The Mongolia, and when it arrives, he scrutinizes the passengers and crew, looking for the thief. A man approaches the detective asking where the consulate office might be and if the detective will stamp his passport. Poor unsuspecting Passepartout has no idea that he has just given his master's documents to the detective wishing to arrest Fogg.
