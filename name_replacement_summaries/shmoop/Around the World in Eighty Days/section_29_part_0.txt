Aouda begins crying over Passepartout, while Phileas simply looks grave. He decides to go on a daring rescue into Sioux territory and asks for volunteers from the soldiers at Fort Kearney. In a great show of bravery, thirty guys agree to help him go rescue the prisoners. Fix stays behind to wait with Aouda. He worries about whether Phileas will come back, but mostly for selfish reasons like, \"How will I collect the reward if Fogg is killed?\" The train and engine are reunited and get ready to leave the Fort Kearney station. It won't wait for Fogg, so Aouda and Fix are forced to watch it go. The next morning, Phileas rides into the station with Passepartout, the soldiers, and the other two prisoners. Fogg learns that their train left without them and calmly asks when the next one will be coming.", "analysis": ""}
