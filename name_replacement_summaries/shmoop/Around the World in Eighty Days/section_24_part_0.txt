Fogg and Aouda go out to eat and \"by chance\" bump into Fix. The three go on a small tour of the city. They get caught up in a political rally and are afraid for Aouda's safety as things start to get rough and rowdy between the two parties. An all-out brawl occurs before the three can make their way out of it. A man with a red goatee tries to punch Phileas but misses him and hits Fix instead. Fogg calls him a \"Yankee\"--ouch, what an insult--and the goatee calls him \"Englishman.\" Sick burns all around. Then the goatee calls him out. He challenges Phileas to a duel and we find out the goatee belongs to one Colonel Stamp Proctor. Both Phileas and Fix are in need of new clothes after the brawl, but Aouda is unhurt. Fogg swears he will have the duel with Proctor, even if it means he has to come back to America after winning the \"around the world\" bet.", "analysis": ""}
