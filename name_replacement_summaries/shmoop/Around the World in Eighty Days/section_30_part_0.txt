Passepartout feels guilty because it's all his fault, but it's Detective Fix who proposes a new plan. He decides to \"help\" Fogg by suggesting they travel via a newfangled gadget called a \"sledge\" . Phileas gives the okay, but his gentlemanly honor comes out when he suggests the trip will be dangerous and that Aouda should remain behind with Passepartout. Aouda refuses, being the brave girl that she is, and accompanies Fogg to Omaha. Phileas and company grab a train to Chicago and then another one to New York, only to find that the ship bound for Liverpool, England has already left.", "analysis": ""}
