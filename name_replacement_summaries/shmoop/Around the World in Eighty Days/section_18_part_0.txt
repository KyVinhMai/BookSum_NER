Fix is disappointed because the arrest warrant for Fogg has not yet arrived; he offers Passepartout a drink and tells him the secret mission to arrest Fogg. Poor Passepartout doesn't understand what Fix is really saying, though. They are talking from two ends of the same story: While Fix is talking about the robbery, Passepartout is referring to Fix being an agent of the Reform club. When all the circle talking is finally over, Passepartout finally understands Fix's real purpose . He gets super ticked-off and keeps drinking, swearing he doesn't believe an inch of the detective's story. Then Fix slips Passepartout some opium so he won't be able to let the cat out of the bag to Fogg.", "analysis": ""}
