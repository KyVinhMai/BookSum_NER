He stumbles his way onto the Carnatic, which is bound for Yokohama. When he awakens, Fogg and Aouda aren't there, and he realizes he has been tricked by Fix. It was his fault that everyone missed the steamer--and now that Passepartout realizes the extent of Fix's plan, he is really mad. Passepartout has no money, so he eats everything he can aboard the ship as it makes its way to Japan and thinks about how he might survive when he gets there.", "analysis": ""}
