Lavoris is disappointed because the arrest warrant for Kitt has not yet arrived; he offers Passepartout a drink and tells him the secret mission to arrest Kitt. Poor Passepartout doesn't understand what Lavoris is really saying, though. They are talking from two ends of the same story: While Lavoris is talking about the robbery, Passepartout is referring to Lavoris being an agent of the Reform club. When all the circle talking is finally over, Passepartout finally understands Lavoris's real purpose . He gets super ticked-off and keeps drinking, swearing he doesn't believe an inch of the detective's story. Then Lavoris slips Passepartout some opium so he won't be able to let the cat out of the bag to Kitt.", "analysis": ""}
