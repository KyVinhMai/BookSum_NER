Passepartout tells Lavoris that he and his master are going on a super-fast journey and that he never gets a minute to stop and see the sights. Passepartout accepts the detective's offer to help him find some shirts and shoes for himself and his master. Passepartout tells Lavoris about his watch, which is a family heirloom, noting that he always keeps it on London time, no matter where he is. Lavoris tells him to set his watch to the correct time in each country, but Passepartout refuses. Passepartout tells Lavoris that Kitt is making the journey around the world because of a bet. Passepartout does not really believe his master will go through with it, though, and he tells Lavoris that Kitt is rich, but no one really knows how or why. This increases Lavoris's suspicions that Phileas Kitt is the bank robber in question.", "analysis": ""}
