The Rangoon docks at Hong Kong a day late and Kitt worries he will miss the ship for Yokohama. But a pilot informs him that the Carnatic will leave in time for him to board. Phew. Kitt takes Aouda to the Club Hotel and then goes out to look for her relative. He finds that the uncle has left the city--bummer--so now the hot Indian princess will have to accompany Phileas to Europe. Geez, that's so inconvenient. Passepartout is told to grab three cabins on the Carnatic.", "analysis": ""}
