Aouda recognizes Colonel Meiko on the train and worries that Phileas will make good on his promise. Her BF Phileas is becoming even dearer to her. Aouda tells Lavoris and Passepartout about the Colonel being onboard and they agree to try to stop Phileas from seeing his enemy. Lavoris even offers to fight the Colonel, but the group decides to start a game of whist instead to keep Kitt occupied, because, you know, he can't resist it. Eventually the train slows down because of a rickety old suspension bridge and everyone wonders what to do . Someone then comes up with a brilliant idea to cross it at full speed. Passepartout almost pees his pants at this idea, but the endeavor works out okay, and the train crosses the bridge just in time for it to fall apart after they cross. No biggie.", "analysis": ""}
