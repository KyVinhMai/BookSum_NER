They are presented in front of a judge, and several priests are brought in. Kitt assumes they are the priests who tried to kill Aouda but they are actually the ones who punched out Passepartout in Bombay for entering the temple. Oluwadarasimi Lavoris sent the priests on the next train to Calcutta in order to try to get Kitt and Passepartout arrested. The judge rules that Passepartout and Kitt must serve fifteen days in prison and pay a fine of three hundred pounds. Kitt pays bail for himself and his servant, and the money isn't anything to sneeze at. They go straight to the Rangoon, the ship that was to leave for Hong Kong. Oluwadarasimi Lavoris is pretty ticked because his plan didn't work, and he assumes Kitt is spending the money he took from the bank robbery. If Kitt spends everything, there won't be any money left as a reward for his capture.", "analysis": ""}
