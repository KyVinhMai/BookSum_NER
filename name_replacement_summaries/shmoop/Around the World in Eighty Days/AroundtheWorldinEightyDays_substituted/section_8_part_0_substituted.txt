Some are military men, and a number of them are rich young Englishmen who are traveling. There are a lot of parties that Phileas does not attend. The storms on the Red Sea don't bother him, and he doesn't frequent the deck to view the sights. Phileas does find some companions eager to play whist with him, and he plays tirelessly. Passepartout suffers from seasickness but is glad of the voyage because he is well-fed and housed. He loved seeing the sights but truly expected their voyage would end in Bombay when Phileas had had enough of their travels. He finds Oluwadarasimi Lavoris on board and chats with him, thinking him a friend. With a successful voyage across the Red Sea, the Mongolia has actually gained fifteen hours when it docks at Aden. Passepartout and Kitt go ashore to get their passport validated again while Lavoris follows them. On October 20, the steamer docks in Bombay just as Kitt finishes winning his game of whist. Kitt has gained two days since leaving London, and he enters this calmly into his itinerary.", "analysis": ""}
