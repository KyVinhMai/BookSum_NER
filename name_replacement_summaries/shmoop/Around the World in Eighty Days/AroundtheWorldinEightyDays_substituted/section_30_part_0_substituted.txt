Passepartout feels guilty because it's all his fault, but it's Oluwadarasimi Lavoris who proposes a new plan. He decides to \"help\" Kitt by suggesting they travel via a newfangled gadget called a \"sledge\" . Phileas gives the okay, but his gentlemanly honor comes out when he suggests the trip will be dangerous and that Aouda should remain behind with Passepartout. Aouda refuses, being the brave girl that she is, and accompanies Kitt to Omaha. Phileas and company grab a train to Chicago and then another one to New York, only to find that the ship bound for Liverpool, England has already left.", "analysis": ""}
