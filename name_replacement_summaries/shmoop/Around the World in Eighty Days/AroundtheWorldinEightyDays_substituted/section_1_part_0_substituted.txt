Passepartout describes Phileas Kitt to us as about forty, handsome, tall, and well-built . He seems to like to act rather than talk, and he keeps an immaculate appearance as well as a fancy wardrobe. Passepartout compares Kitt to one of the wax figures at Madame Tussaud's. He's calm and practical, and Passepartout thinks his master is British to the core. Passepartout is a servant, but he's a gentleman at heart, and he thinks that he can respect Kitt even if his master has some really odd tendencies. Passepartout learns everything runs on a tight schedule in the Kitt house and he sort of likes the neatness and routine. He thinks he and Kitt will get along pretty well.", "analysis": ""}
