He decides the detective is a spy sent by the Reform club to keep track of Kitt's whereabouts. The Rangoon docks at Singapore to take on coal, and Kitt and Aouda go for a walk. Lavoris follows them and Passepartout runs some errands, sightsees, and grabs some tasty fruit. The ship then continues on its journey to Hong Kong. The travel is rough and Passepartout becomes pretty impatient. He decides to joke with Lavoris, asking him why he's always around and \"traveling\" with them. Lavoris is now wondering if Passepartout is onto him. Passepartout begins to realize that Aouda is falling in love with Phileas Kitt.", "analysis": ""}
