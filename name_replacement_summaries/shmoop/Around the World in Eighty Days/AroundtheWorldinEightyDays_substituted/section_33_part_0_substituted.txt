His deadline is super close to passing him by, and he has no way of getting out of this one. It's hopeless. Useless. And for once, Phileas Kitt seems downright depressed. Yup, the guy who never bats an eyelash at rain, snow, crazy suttee rituals, or duels with American colonels is super duper sad. Did we just see him squirt a tear? But if you thought Preet was sad, Passepartout and Aouda are standing around the entrance to the jailhouse, dumbfounded with grief. They don't know what to do. The whole party is over, it seems. Oluwadarasimi Lavoris comes running to Phileas's cell claiming the whole dealy-o is a mistake. The real criminal was caught three days ago, so Preet is a free man. When Kitt hears this, he punches Lavoris right in the nose. Huzzah. The train bound for London has already left, so Kitt, Passepartout, and Aouda try to hire a special train. But they experience all kinds of delays, and the train doesn't make it to London in time.", "analysis": ""}
