Aouda begins to fall ever deeper in love with Phileas, despite his cold, calculating exterior. The next day Fogg and Aouda reach the dock of the Carnatic but the ship has already left. Sly Fix meets them at the dock and pretend-innocently inquires about Passepartout. He's pretty happy he managed to foil their plans. Phileas, however, is able to find a ship called the Tankadere that will take them to Shanghai. He invites Detective Fix aboard and they set off, even though no one can find Passepartout. The journey continues without him.", "analysis": ""}
