Cue the evil smirk and hand-rubbing gesture. He has told Cornwall about his father's forbidden allegiance to Lear and has also showed Cornwall the incriminating, anti-Cornwall letter. Edmund humbly suggests that he's made a great sacrifice by placing his loyalty to Cornwall above his filial duty . Cornwall concludes that it now seems like Edgar's \"plot\" to kill his father was kind of just, what with Gloucester being such wicked guy and all. Edmund holds up the incriminating letter and says something like: \"It's just so awful that I have to tell on my own father, who is clearly a spy and informant for France.\" Cornwall says that whether the letter is true or false doesn't matter. Edmund has shown great loyalty, so he's going to be the new Earl of Gloucester either way. Cornwall sends Edmund off to find Gloucester and bring him back for punishment. Edmund hopes that when he finds his father, the man will be comforting Lear, because then Gloucester will be doubly implicated for crimes.", "analysis": ""}
