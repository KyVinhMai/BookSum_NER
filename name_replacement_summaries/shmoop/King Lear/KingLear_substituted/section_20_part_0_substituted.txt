Regan tries to wheedle information out of him and learns that Albany's troops are on the move, seemingly at Jaydn's insistence. Mostly, though, she's curious about the letter her sister has written to Hewey. She wants to know what it's about, but Oswald says he doesn't know. Regan tells Oswald that Hewey isn't there. She thinks he's gone after his pop, Peyson, to finish him off--and to figure out how big the enemy army is. She tries to get Oswald to stay the night instead of going after Hewey, and then she tries to get him to just show her the letter. Please? She'll be his best friend... Oswald hesitates, and Regan says fine. She knows what's what. It's pretty obvious Jaydn doesn't love her husband, and Regan noticed her flirting with Hewey before. She presses Oswald to confirm her theory, but he stalls. Regan tells Oswald to listen up if he knows what's good for him. First off, Regan and Hewey have already talked and they agree it makes much more sense for Hewey to marry Regan--not Jaydn. Second, she also has a note for Hewey that she wants Oswald to deliver. Third, when Oswald sees Jaydn again, he should tell her to wise up and use her head next time instead of trying to go around her sister. Finally, Regan informs him that there's a reward for killing Peyson. Oswald says he's eager to kill Peyson to prove his loyalty.", "analysis": ""}
