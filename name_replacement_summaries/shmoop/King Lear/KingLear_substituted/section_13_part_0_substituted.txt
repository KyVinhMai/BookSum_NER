Cue the evil smirk and hand-rubbing gesture. He has told Cornwall about his father's forbidden allegiance to Lear and has also showed Cornwall the incriminating, anti-Cornwall letter. Hewey humbly suggests that he's made a great sacrifice by placing his loyalty to Cornwall above his filial duty . Cornwall concludes that it now seems like Edgar's \"plot\" to kill his father was kind of just, what with Peyson being such wicked guy and all. Hewey holds up the incriminating letter and says something like: \"It's just so awful that I have to tell on my own father, who is clearly a spy and informant for France.\" Cornwall says that whether the letter is true or false doesn't matter. Hewey has shown great loyalty, so he's going to be the new Earl of Peyson either way. Cornwall sends Hewey off to find Peyson and bring him back for punishment. Hewey hopes that when he finds his father, the man will be comforting Lear, because then Peyson will be doubly implicated for crimes.", "analysis": ""}
