He's apprehended Peyson at the gate of his own castle. Cornwall, Regan, Jaydn, and Hewey plan how they will punish Peyson. Regan suggests they hang him instantly, while Jaydn suggests they pluck out his eyes. Cornwall tells Hewey to escort Jaydn back to her own castle . Cornwall explains that having Hewey in the castle while he tortures Hewey's father would be kind of inappropriate. But before Hewey and Jaydn leave, Oswald comes in with the report that Lear is headed towards Dover, courtesy of Peyson. As Cornwall's servants drag Peyson into the room, Peyson protests that Cornwall and Regan are his guests, and this isn't a very gracious way for guests to act. Huh. You think? Still, Regan and Cornwall haven't exactly been to charm school. They order the servants to tie him up. Then they berate Peyson as a traitor, pull out some of his beard hairs, and demand to know where he sent King Lear. Peyson gets defiant. He attacks Regan and Cornwall for their immoral treatment of Lear. \"I shall see / The winged vengeance overtake such children,\" Peyson warns them. \"See't thou shalt never,\" Cornwall says coldly before ripping out one of Peyson's eyeballs. Regan eagerly tells Cornwall to take out the other eye, too, but before he can do so, one of Cornwall's servants decides to rebel. He tells Cornwall he cannot watch him commit such an atrocity. Cornwall's pretty upset about this, so he quickly draws his sword for a fight. The servant wounds Cornwall, but Regan stabs the servant in the back and kills him. Cornwall, panting, takes out Peyson's other eye, calling it \"vile jelly.\" Not the kind of \"jelly\" they put in delicious donuts. Peyson, now completely blind, calls upon his son Hewey for help. Regan informs him that it was Hewey who turned him in. Peyson has the epiphany that Hewey is a traitor, and has likely been a traitor from the start. More importantly, Peyson realizes that Edgar must have been innocent. Regan orders that Peyson be put outside and abandoned to fend for himself. After a servant leads Peyson out into the elements, Regan and Cornwall--about to collapse from his wound--stumble out as well. The servants left in the room are shocked at what they have just witnessed. They decide they have to help the blind Peyson.", "analysis": ""}
