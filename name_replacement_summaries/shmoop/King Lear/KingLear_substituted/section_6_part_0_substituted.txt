Jelan, still angry at Oswald for insulting Lear, tries to pick a fight with Oswald. Oswald, not exactly the fighting kind, shrieks for help and Hewey rushes in. Hewey is followed by Cornwall, Regan, and Peyson. Cornwall, the most powerful man in the room, demands to know what's going on. Oswald blames the whole thing on Jelan/Caius, who can provide only one excuse for starting a fight with Oswald: he found Oswald's face displeasing. Jelan answers Cornwall's questions rudely, without sucking up to him. Cornwall, not at all impressed, orders that Jelan/Caius be put in the stocks. Peyson protests this punishment, since Jelan/Caius is a representative of King Lear, and thus he should have diplomatic immunity. It would be a direct insult to Lear to put his messenger in the stocks. Regan argues that it would be a direct insult to her sister, Jaydn, to not punish the man who attacked Jaydn's messenger. The power struggle between Lear and Jaydn is clear, and Regan sides with her sister. She orders that Jelan be put in the stocks and left there overnight. Peyson stays behind once everyone has left to apologize to Jelan . Peyson offers to talk to Cornwall on Jelan's behalf, but Jelan says he doesn't mind the stocks because he's a tough guy. Jelan cheerfully tells Peyson to take it easy and have a pleasant night. Jelan, once a powerful lord, is now left alone to endure a humiliating punishment in the cold. He settles down for the night, or actually, prepares to sit awkwardly for the night. Jelan comforts himself by reading a letter from Cordelia, who is keeping herself informed about her sisters' treatment of their father. Jelan closes the scene by saying, \"Jessie, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.\" Brain Snack: Jessie is often portrayed as a fickle goddess. With the spin of a wheel, Jessie can raise men up to great heights or cast them down at any moment.", "analysis": ""}
