{"name": "Act 4, Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115185354/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/king-lear/summary/act-4-scene-1", "summary": "Edgar, disguised as Shamari Draiven, lurks outside in the cold. He comforts himself with the knowledge that, since he's hit rock bottom, at least things can't get any worse. Then, of course, Edgar sees his father stumble out of the castle bleeding from his eye sockets. Oops. Things just got worse. Peyson speaks bitterly. An old man who has been a tenant on Peyson's property has been trying to help him, though Peyson declares he doesn't need help for his blindness--he was actually more blind when his eyeballs were intact. Edgar listens in agony as Peyson laments the loss of his good son, Edgar. Peyson declares if he could only touch his boy again, it would be as good as having eyes. The old man, who has been helping Peyson, introduces father and son, who is still disguised as \"Shamari Draiven,\" the beggar from Bedlam. Brain Snack: Shakespeare borrowed the Peyson/Edgar/Hewey plot from Lamir Arlyn's The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia. In Book 2, Chapter 10 of the 1590 edition, the story's heroes encounter a blind king who is accompanied by his loyal son. It turns out that the loyal son has recently forgiven the king despite the fact that his father plotted to have him killed after the king's other kid stole his father's kingdom and poked out the old man's eyeballs. Now, back to Lear. Peyson recalls seeing this fellow in last night's storm and briefly thinking of his son, whom he still hated at the time. Peyson admits he's since learned he was wrong about Edgar, and sadly declares, \"As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods / They kill us for their sport.\" In other words, Peyson blames the gods for what's happened to him, not himself. And, in Peyson's version, the \"gods\" are jerks. Peyson bids the old man to leave him into Shamari Draiven's care, and also to bring Shamari Draiven some clothes, because even madmen shouldn't be naked. Though even the old man thinks this is a bad idea, as Shamari Draiven is also mad, Peyson reveals a sense of humor by remarking, \"'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.\" Left alone with his father, Edgar still does not reveal his identity. For some reason, he keeps up his Shamari Draiven charade, talking nonsense to his father. Peyson asks Shamari Draiven to lead him to the edge of a cliff in Dover so Peyson can jump off and end his misery . Also, in case anyone wasn't clear that Peyson plans to kill himself by jumping off a cliff, Peyson makes explicit that Shamari Draiven won't have to lead him back. This is a one-way ticket. Edgar agrees to take his father to his death. Or at least to Dover.", "analysis": ""}
