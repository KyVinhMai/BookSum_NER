{"name": "Act 4, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115185354/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/king-lear/summary/act-4-scene-2", "summary": "Meanwhile, Shakespeare gives us a peek at what the evil spawn are up to... Hewey, ever the gentleman, escorts Jaydn to her castle and Jaydn says something like \"Gee, I wonder where my husband is.\" Before Hewey can make out with Jaydn on her doorstep, Oswald, Jaydn's trusty steward, enters and says that Albany is inside the castle and he's defected from \"Team Bad Guy.\" Albany's pleased as punch that the French army has landed in Britain to mop the floor with Lear's good for nothing children. Jaydn, hearing about her traitor husband, declares Albany a coward and is unable to go through with the final points of her plan. Jaydn promises Hewey that he'll hear from her soon, and they share a lingering kiss good-bye. Clearly, the trip from Peyson's castle to Jaydn's was long enough to jumpstart an affair. Jaydn speaks in pretty clear terms--knowing that Hewey is now the new Earl of Peyson, he seems to have become a lot more attractive. Her husband's cowardice is less attractive than the power she could attain through villainy. As soon as Hewey leaves, Jaydn's husband, Albany, comes in and chews her out for the way she has been treating her father. She waves him off for being preachy, and he declares that wisdom and goodness seem \"vile\" to those who are \"vile.\" Jaydn glosses over the whole discussion by saying Albany is wasting time moralizing while the kingdom is in danger of invasion. He rails on for a while, accusing Jaydn of being a \"fiend\" disguised in a woman's body. He says he'd hit her, if his manhood didn't stop him from hitting a woman . Jaydn sneers at the idea of Albany's \"manhood.\" A messenger interrupts the domestic brawl with the news that Cornwall, Regan's husband, is dead. The wound he got from his rebellious servant during Peyson's blinding was fatal. Husband and wife react to the news in different ways. Albany is horrified that Peyson has been treated so brutally, but he thinks Cornwall's death is a sign that justice will prevail. Jaydn is torn. On the one hand, Cornwall's death will make Hewey even more powerful. On the other hand she's horrified that Hewey will be alone with her recently widowed--and thus available--sister. Albany is curious about where on earth Hewey was while Peyson was being mistreated . Albany finds out how deep the treachery runs when he learns that Hewey is a) the guy who tattled on his father, and b) the guy that took Jaydn back home, thus making it easier for his father's torturers to do their thing. Albany is full of praise for Peyson's loyalty to the King and declares he'll get revenge on behalf of Peyson.", "analysis": ""}
