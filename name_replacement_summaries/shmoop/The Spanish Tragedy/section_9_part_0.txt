He immediately runs to his garden to help the damsel in distress. When he gets there, he finds out his son is who really needs help. And Bel-Imperia is nowhere to be seen. Hieronimo then breaks into a heartfelt lament that wakes his wife, Isabella, and leads her to the garden. The mourning couple rants and raves, promising to bring the culprit to justice . Hieronimo then makes Isabella promise to keep what they've seen secret until he can do some detective work.
