{"name": "Act 3, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630080946/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-spanish-tragedy/summary/act-3-scene-2", "summary": "Hieronimo enters alone and delivers a serious bummer of a soliloquy. His speech is all about not getting justice, and it's heavily ironic because he is supposed to be the dude dishing out justice in Spain. As he soliloquizes, a letter drops magically from the sky . But we know that Bel-Imperia drops the letter. Hieronimo happens to be standing right under the place where Lorenzo has stowed away his sister--how's that for convenient? But the whole letter thing was a wee bit inconvenient for Bel-Imperia, actually. She didn't have a pen handy, meaning she had to write the letter with her own blood. It seems fitting that this bloody play has a bloody letter . Bloody yet straightforward, the letter clearly spells out who killed Horatio and asks Hieronimo to get with the revenging already. Hieronimo is down to get his murder on, but he chooses to test the letter's truthiness before killing two important, royal types. Hieronimo determines to try and find Bel-Imperia to confirm the veracity of the letter--she'd be like, \"dude, I wrote it in blood, didn't I?\" Pedringano then conveniently enters the scene, which gives Hieronimo the opportunity to ask about Bel-Imperia's whereabouts. The slippery servant says something like, \"I dunno.\" At which point, Lorenzo walks in and says something to the effect of, \"if you're looking for my sister, look no more. Our father has hidden her away for shaming our name.\" Lorenzo tells Hieronimo he can get a message to her. But Hieronimo smartly trusts no man, so he says his message can wait. All of this makes Lorenzo think that Hieronimo smells a rat. He then wrongly concludes that his henchman, Serberine, must've leaked some information to Hieronimo. No problem, he concludes. I'll just pay Pedringano to kill Serberine--which he does. But as Pedringano leaves to do the deed, we find out through soliloquy that some more of Lorenzo's lackeys will be waiting at the murder scene to catch Pedringano in the act. Lorenzo is bad, but you've got to hand it to him--he's good at what he does.", "analysis": ""}
