The recently warring kings hug it out as they celebrate new family ties between Spain and Portugal. After the mighty rulers depart, the Duke of Castile approaches Lorenzo to warn him not to do anything that might get in the way of his sister's happiness . The duke says that he has heard rumors that his son, Lorenzo, has been blocking Hieronimo's path to the king. Lorenzo lies. But the duke obviously knows his son is a scoundrel, because he makes Lorenzo promise that he will never mistreat Hieronimo. This is important because we learn that the duke isn't in on the murders. Lorenzo tells his dad that rumormongers are hating on him, and that he was merely trying to keep Hieronimo from embarrassing himself. The duke tells Lorenzo to immediately squash his beef with the knight marshal. And then he sends for Hieronimo so the two can kiss and make up. Bel-Imperia and Balthazar conveniently enter the scene to give time for Hieronimo to come along. Balthazar is still trying to chat up Bel-Imperia as they enter, but the duke interrupts them to say that he forgives Bel-Imperia for ever dating Andrea--gee thanks, dad. When Hieronimo shows up, the duke plays peacemaker between his son and the knight marshal. But Hieronimo isn't having it. He draws his sword and challenges Lorenzo to a fight. The duke begs Hieronimo to forgive his son, inviting him to be a guest at their house for the wedding. For now, Hieronimo adopts the guise of forgiveness. But it's clear that he is just biding his time.", "analysis": ""}
