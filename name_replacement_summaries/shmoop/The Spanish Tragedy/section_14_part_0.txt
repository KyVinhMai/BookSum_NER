While he's doing this, a messenger cruises up and says that Serberine was murdered by Pedringano, to which Lorenzo responds with his best, \"Oh my, how shocking!\" Then another messenger enters with a letter addressed to Lorenzo from Pedringano. In the letter, Pedringano reminds Lorenzo that he's just as guilty of killing Serberine as he is. But the sly Lorenzo is already one step ahead of the servant. So Lorenzo tells the messenger to assure Pedringano that all will be well just so long as he keeps his mouth shut and stays patient. He then gives the messenger a box and tells him to tell Pedringano that his pardon is inside the box. He warns the messenger to never open the box and to warn Pedringano that the box will only be opened just before his execution. Lorenzo slinks off to have a little chat with the executioner.", "analysis": ""}
