She is utterly overcome with grief as she soliloquizes at the scene of her son's murder. In her passion, she cuts down every single tree in the bower where her son was hanged. She curses the place to be ever filled with snakes and all kinds of slimy things. As she chides her husband for delaying revenge for so long, she stabs herself in the stomach and dies. This is probably the most sorrowful scene in the tragedy, and a reminder that women in the play had few outlets to express rage and seek justice after being wronged.", "analysis": ""}
