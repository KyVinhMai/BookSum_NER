{"name": "Act 3, Scene 13", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630080946/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-spanish-tragedy/summary/act-3-scene-13", "summary": "Suffice it to say that Hieronimo has now achieved a new level of rage. He delivers his most powerful soliloquy on revenge, which begins impressively with a tough guy Latin phrase: \"Vindicta mihi!\" . The phrase means \"vengeance is mine,\" but doesn't the Latin phrasing make it sound super bad? He also delivers another Latin phrase that roughly translates to \"the safe way for crime is always through crime.\" This demonstrates that Hieronimo has entirely given up on lawful pursuits of justice--it's payback time. Because criminals have to operate in secrecy, Hieronimo makes a verbal commitment to act insane so nobody will know what he's up to. But he's already been acting crazy so we're pretty used to this routine. His speech on going bad is interrupted by a servant who announces that his employers are on their way to see if Hieronimo can get help them meet with the king. The irony is thick, as Hieronimo has failed throughout to get audience with his king. The irony doesn't escape Hieronimo--he gets really, really mad. Next, an elderly gentleman enters the scene to complain about how his son was murdered--the play is really laying it on thick now. Hieronimo sees himself in the old man. He therefore shows the old man great respect, even giving him his own wallet full of money. He turns back to the original dudes seeking the king , and tears up all of their legal papers. Hieronimo is in no mood for frivolous lawsuits. It's safe to say that these guys didn't have their legal papers backed up on the cloud, because they pretty much go bananas. The litigious dudes run away leaving Hieronimo and the old man alone, but Hieronimo's insane behavior soon scares the old dude away, too. No justice for one means no justice for all, apparently.", "analysis": ""}
