Lorenzo tries to assure Balthazar that his sister will eventually give in if he just remains patient, but he does admit that it's possible that she loves another knight. Lorenzo is a forward thinking baddie, so he's got a plan if Bel-Imperia is crushing on a new dude. As soon as he tells Balthazar this, the henchman who will carry out this plan enters the room--his name is Pedringano . Lorenzo reminds Pedringano that he owes him one for a solid in the past. Apparently, Pedringano helped to hide Bel-Imperia's relationship with Andrea from the King. And Lorenzo helped to shield the wormy servant from the king's wrath. After being reminded of his debt, Pedringano is more than willing to give Lorenzo any information he might need--in fact, Pedringano seems to enjoy being bad. His first bad guy move is to rat out the lady he serves. So, Pedringano spills the beans and says that Bel-Imperia now loves Horatio--big trouble. He even goes the extra mile by letting Lorenzo know that he passed love notes to Horatio for Bel-Imperia. Lorenzo happily pays Pedringano for the down low, and says something like, \"there's more where that comes from if you wanna help.\" Pedringano accepts his new role as Lorenzo's moustache-twirling-assistant-villain. And while the money is nice, the job is also a perfect fit for a fellow of Pedringano's character and skill set. After Pedringano exits the scene, Lorenzo tells Balthazar that the only way he'll hook up with Bel-Imperia is if Horatio is dead--man, this guy is really devoted to matchmaking.", "analysis": ""}
