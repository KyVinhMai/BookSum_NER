And they ask Pedringano to stand guard--whoops. In good villainous form, Pedringano creeps out the audience by speaking directly to them: \"Instead of watching I'll deserve more gold by fetching Don Lorenzo to this match\" . Bel-Imperia tells Horatio that she has a premonition that something bad is about to happen but her lover comforts her by saying that all will be well . Instead of listening to Bel-Imperia's concerns, the lovers talk lovey-like. While they are busy smooching, Lorenzo, Balthazar, Serberine , and Pedringano enter the scene to get the drop on Horatio. They quickly hang Horatio from a tree, and as if being hanged wasn't enough, they repeatedly stab and mangle his body. Bel-Imperia witnesses the merciless slaughter, crying bloody murder at the top of her lungs all the while.", "analysis": ""}
