Overheard conversations are a great convention for creating intrigue and moving plots along. So, as Pedringano, Lorenzo, and Balthazar hide behind a potted plant or something, Bel-Imperia and Horatio give a public display of affection without even knowing it. Horatio notices that Bel-Imperia is sad even though they're falling in love. She says she's doing her best not to worry, but that she senses the bad coming . Now is a good time to mention that the ghost of Andrea has zero problem with his buddy dating his ex. All the while, the three evil amigos spying on the scene are spewing hatefully violent remarks unbeknownst to the lovers. Bel-Imperia and Horatio realize that everyone will freak out about their relationship. So they decide to get sneaky and make secret vows in Horatio's secret garden. After the lovers exit, Lorenzo vows to send Horatio to \"eternal night,\" which really doesn't sound that pleasant at all .", "analysis": ""}
