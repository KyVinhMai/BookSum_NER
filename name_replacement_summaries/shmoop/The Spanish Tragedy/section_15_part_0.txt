In his latest sad speech, he explores how jacked up it is to bring the law down on others while not getting any justice for his own family. But we've got to respect his dilemma--how does one successfully convict a pair of princes with nothing but a bloody letter that fell from the sky? At the end of his speech, the gallows party enters, including: Pedringano, the hangman, and the messenger boy with the empty box. And Pedringano is one smart-mouthed servant. Since he thinks he's safely above the law, he triumphantly berates everyone, including the hangman. The messenger boy of course points to the box, which spurs Pedringano to be the wittiest performer in the history of hangings. Hieronimo and the hangman are utterly dismayed by the strange spectacle, but when it comes time to hang Pedringano he is....hanged. What did you think would happen? The box was empty.", "analysis": ""}
