Andrea's ghost is greatly pleased by the outcome of Hieronimo's play. Strange, though, that he doesn't lament Bel-Imperia's death. The ghost tells Revenge he will now return to the underworld to ask Proserpine if he can decide where all his friends and enemies will spend their afterlife. In short, this means endless tortures for his enemies and appropriate places of rest for his friends. Revenge says this will all surely be so. And our tragedy comes to an end.", "analysis": ""}
