Given the happy news, Lorenzo sends the messenger to inform the jailor to free Bel-Imperia. After getting freed, Bel-Imperia storms angrily on the scene. But Lorenzo tells her that he held her captive so that her dad wouldn't yell at her for slumming with Horatio. Lorenzo then tells Bel-Imperia that he smoothed over the issues with dad. Bel-Imperia has to know her brother is lying, but she plays her cards close to the chest. The always eagerly persistent Balthazar busts into wooing mode again, but Bel-Imperia verbally beats down the would-be Romeo, once again.", "analysis": ""}
