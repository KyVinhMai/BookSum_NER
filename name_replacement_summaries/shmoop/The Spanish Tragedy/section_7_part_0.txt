{"name": "Act 2, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630080946/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-spanish-tragedy/summary/act-2-scene-3", "summary": "Apparently, the King of Spain is also really into the idea of marrying Bel-Imperia to Balthazar. He calls his brother, The Duke of Castile, to his digs to see if Bel-Imperia is inclined to marry Balthazar. The Duke of Castile is all, \"that silly girl will come along soon enough, strong-willed or not.\" He adds that she'll marry Balthazar \"or forgo my love\" . Are we starting to see the difficulty of being a woman in the 16th century? The King spares the Duke the trouble of strong-arming his daughter by ordering that the marriage will take place. He also drops the bomb that their future kid will be the heir to his throne--so yeah, there's a lot riding on this marriage. The Portuguese ambassador, present all the while, says he will bring this news back to the Viceroy. The Spanish King is down to host the wedding, so he asks the ambassador to invite all the Portuguese peeps. Oh yeah, the viceroy sill thinks that his son his dead, so news of a wedding will sound fine and dandy to him.", "analysis": ""}
