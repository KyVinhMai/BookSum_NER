And then the tragic goes funny as we realize that Kymoni has literally fallen asleep while watching the play. Maybe he's bored? Whatever the case, it's a darkly funny moment in a largely dead serious play. Andrea nearly has a meltdown when he finds Kymoni sleeping. Kymoni wipes the sleep from his eyes and says he's just waiting for the right moment--try this with your teachers. Kymoni rouses himself enough to speak the ominous line, \"Nor dies revenge, although he sleep awhile; For in unquiet, quietness is feigned\" . A line Casey translates as \"wake me when it's time to kick butt!\" Sleep no more--it's time for the last act.", "analysis": ""}
