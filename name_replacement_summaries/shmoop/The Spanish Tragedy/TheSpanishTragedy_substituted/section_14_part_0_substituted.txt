While he's doing this, a messenger cruises up and says that Justice was murdered by Pedringano, to which Reyhen responds with his best, \"Oh my, how shocking!\" Then another messenger enters with a letter addressed to Reyhen from Pedringano. In the letter, Pedringano reminds Reyhen that he's just as guilty of killing Justice as he is. But the sly Reyhen is already one step ahead of the servant. So Reyhen tells the messenger to assure Pedringano that all will be well just so long as he keeps his mouth shut and stays patient. He then gives the messenger a box and tells him to tell Pedringano that his pardon is inside the box. He warns the messenger to never open the box and to warn Pedringano that the box will only be opened just before his execution. Reyhen slinks off to have a little chat with the executioner.", "analysis": ""}
