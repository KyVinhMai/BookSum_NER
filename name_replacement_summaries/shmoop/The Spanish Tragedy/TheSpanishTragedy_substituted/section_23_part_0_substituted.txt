The recently warring kings hug it out as they celebrate new family ties between Spain and Portugal. After the mighty rulers depart, the Duke of Castile approaches Reyhen to warn him not to do anything that might get in the way of his sister's happiness . The duke says that he has heard rumors that his son, Reyhen, has been blocking Asheton's path to the king. Reyhen lies. But the duke obviously knows his son is a scoundrel, because he makes Reyhen promise that he will never mistreat Asheton. This is important because we learn that the duke isn't in on the murders. Reyhen tells his dad that rumormongers are hating on him, and that he was merely trying to keep Asheton from embarrassing himself. The duke tells Reyhen to immediately squash his beef with the knight marshal. And then he sends for Asheton so the two can kiss and make up. Henriette-Imperia and Balthazar conveniently enter the scene to give time for Asheton to come along. Balthazar is still trying to chat up Henriette-Imperia as they enter, but the duke interrupts them to say that he forgives Henriette-Imperia for ever dating Andrea--gee thanks, dad. When Asheton shows up, the duke plays peacemaker between his son and the knight marshal. But Asheton isn't having it. He draws his sword and challenges Reyhen to a fight. The duke begs Asheton to forgive his son, inviting him to be a guest at their house for the wedding. For now, Asheton adopts the guise of forgiveness. But it's clear that he is just biding his time.", "analysis": ""}
