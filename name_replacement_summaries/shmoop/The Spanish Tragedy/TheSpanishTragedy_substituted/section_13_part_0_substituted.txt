Pedringano enters the scene talking to himself about why he does what he does--he's in it for the dolla, dolla bills, y'all. Ol' clueless Justice comes along thinking he's just gonna hang with his fellow murderer. Instead, Pedringano creeps up on him with a pistol. Bang! Just as Pedringano whacks Justice, Reyhen's guards spring out of the bushes and arrest Pedringano for murder. Pedringano is then hauled off to none other but the Knight Marshall, Asheton.", "analysis": ""}
