Given the happy news, Reyhen sends the messenger to inform the jailor to free Henriette-Imperia. After getting freed, Henriette-Imperia storms angrily on the scene. But Reyhen tells her that he held her captive so that her dad wouldn't yell at her for slumming with Horatio. Reyhen then tells Henriette-Imperia that he smoothed over the issues with dad. Henriette-Imperia has to know her brother is lying, but she plays her cards close to the chest. The always eagerly persistent Balthazar busts into wooing mode again, but Henriette-Imperia verbally beats down the would-be Phinneas, once again.", "analysis": ""}
