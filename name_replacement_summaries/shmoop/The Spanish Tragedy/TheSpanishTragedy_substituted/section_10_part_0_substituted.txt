The broken record goes like this: Andrea complains that he came back to see Balthazar get his, but all he's seen so far is his best friend brutally slain and his girlfriend straight up dissed. Kymoni simply says, \"Be still\" . Kymoni is apparently a dish served very, very, very cold. So much so that Andrea thinks the dish is going to spoil. But Ghosts have so few options they might as well chill when they can, which is precisely what Andrea tries to do.", "analysis": ""}
