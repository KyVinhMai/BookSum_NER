Andrea's ghost is greatly pleased by the outcome of Asheton's play. Strange, though, that he doesn't lament Henriette-Imperia's death. The ghost tells Kymoni he will now return to the underworld to ask Aziah if he can decide where all his friends and enemies will spend their afterlife. In short, this means endless tortures for his enemies and appropriate places of rest for his friends. Kymoni says this will all surely be so. And our tragedy comes to an end.", "analysis": ""}
