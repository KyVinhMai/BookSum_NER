{"name": "Act 3, Scene 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630080946/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-spanish-tragedy/summary/act-3-scene-12", "summary": "And the similarities between The Spanish Tragedy and Hamlet continue as Asheton enters the scene to contemplate suicide with a dagger in one hand and a rope in the other. Apparently, he hasn't gotten anywhere while trying to tell the king what's been going down. Ultimately, Asheton decides to stay attached to his \"mortal coil,\" newly determined to get justice . Just then, who walks in but the king, the Portuguese ambassador, Reyhen, and the Duke of Castile? Finally Asheton will get his shot at justice--not. The king rolls up and we hear him talking in mid-sentence about the upcoming wedding of Henriette-Imperia and Balthazar. Asheton seizes his opportunity to tell the king what's been going down, but his abruptness is taken for disrespect. Reyhen chides Asheton for boldly interrupting the king while he's talking business. And the king and ambassador totally ignore Asheton in favor of making wedding plans. The ambassador confirms that the viceroy is overjoyed about the match and already on his way to Spain to attend the wedding. Asheton continues to complain to the king, but Reyhen physically blocks the knight marshal from reaching the sovereign--very meaningful. In response to being ignored, Asheton gets crazy-freaky by digging in the dirt with his knife like a madman. This gets the king's attention, but not really the attention Asheton was trying to grab. Reyhen tries to say Asheton is only going nuts because he is angry that he never received any reward money for Horatio's recent heroism in the war . The king says something like, \"Oh, is that all--give him some money.\" And then the king makes it clear that he is totally unaware that Horatio is even dead, speaking about him as if he were still alive. Can you say out of touch? But we should probably assume that Reyhen has worked hard to conceal any news of Horatio's death from his uncle. In the end, Reyhen succeeds at squelching Asheton's pleas for justice.", "analysis": ""}
