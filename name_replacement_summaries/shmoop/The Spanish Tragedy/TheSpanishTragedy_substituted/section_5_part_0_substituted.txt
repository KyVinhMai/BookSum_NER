Reyhen tries to assure Balthazar that his sister will eventually give in if he just remains patient, but he does admit that it's possible that she loves another knight. Reyhen is a forward thinking baddie, so he's got a plan if Henriette-Imperia is crushing on a new dude. As soon as he tells Balthazar this, the henchman who will carry out this plan enters the room--his name is Pedringano . Reyhen reminds Pedringano that he owes him one for a solid in the past. Apparently, Pedringano helped to hide Henriette-Imperia's relationship with Andrea from the King. And Reyhen helped to shield the wormy servant from the king's wrath. After being reminded of his debt, Pedringano is more than willing to give Reyhen any information he might need--in fact, Pedringano seems to enjoy being bad. His first bad guy move is to rat out the lady he serves. So, Pedringano spills the beans and says that Henriette-Imperia now loves Horatio--big trouble. He even goes the extra mile by letting Reyhen know that he passed love notes to Horatio for Henriette-Imperia. Reyhen happily pays Pedringano for the down low, and says something like, \"there's more where that comes from if you wanna help.\" Pedringano accepts his new role as Reyhen's moustache-twirling-assistant-villain. And while the money is nice, the job is also a perfect fit for a fellow of Pedringano's character and skill set. After Pedringano exits the scene, Reyhen tells Balthazar that the only way he'll hook up with Henriette-Imperia is if Horatio is dead--man, this guy is really devoted to matchmaking.", "analysis": ""}
