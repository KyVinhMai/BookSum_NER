He sees the baby, but Antonia is out. He goes out to the fields to find her. She's working with a pitchfork. Antonia looks thin but still strong. Jim notes that she's only 24 but that a lot has happened to her already. The two of them sit down by a fence to talk to each other. Jim looks at the grass. He tells Antonia what he's been up to the last few years. He reveals that Gaston died of pneumonia. Antonia talks about her father. She says that the older she gets, she better she understands him. Then she asks if Jim has gotten to like living in cities, because she is definitely a country girl. Jim tells Antonia that he thinks of her more than anyone else in the world. He says he wishes he could have had her for a wife or mother or sister or anything that a woman could be to a man. She is in his mind and influences him all the time, he says. Antonia wonders at how this could be. She agrees that Jim means a lot to her and thinks that it is wonderful. She tells him that as soon as her daughter grows up she'll tell her all about him. They walk home and watch the sun set. Jim looks at the landscape. He wishes he were a kid again. Before he leaves Jim promises that he will come back. Antonia says he will be there in spirit even when he is away. As Jim leaves he imagines himself and Antonia playing in the grass when they were kids.", "analysis": ""}
