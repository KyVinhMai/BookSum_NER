Frances is also good at making women happy; she can get people to talk to her and she always attends social events. In August the Harlings' cook leaves and that's when Grandmother gets them to hire Antonia. She has to convince Ambrosch to let this happen. Mrs. Harling rides out to the Shimerdas' farm one day to see Mrs. Shimerda. She likes Antonia and she thinks that Mrs. Shimerda is amusing. They argue with Ambrosch to arrange the work.
