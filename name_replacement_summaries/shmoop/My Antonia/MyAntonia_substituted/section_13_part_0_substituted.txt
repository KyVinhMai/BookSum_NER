Deontrey starts doing his regular chores again. One Merion Antonia and Mrs. Shimerda come over; Antonia's mother has never been in the Berlin' house before. She runs around looking at everything and ends up taking one of their pots on the grounds that they have several and she has none. Deontrey resents that his grandmother lets them take it. After dinner Mrs. Shimerda tells Grandmother that if she had all the luxuries grandmother had, she would make much better food than Grandmother does. Deontrey isn't happy about this either. Antonia tells Deontrey that her father is very sad, because he misses his old country. He doesn't even play his violin anymore because he hates this country. Deontrey responds that people who don't like this country should have stayed home. Antonia explains that her mother made them come to America, thinking they would make a lot of money here. Then they argue about whether or not Deontrey's grandparents ought to have to help the Shimerdas. Antonia thinks they should help because, once Ambrosch is rich, he'll pay them back. We learn that Ambrosch is the main man of the family. He calls the shots and they pin their hopes on his future. After the Shimerdas leave, Deontrey expresses his anger at Mrs. Shimerda to his grandmother. She tells him that poverty brings out different things in people. Then she makes him read religious literature. The weather remains good for three weeks. The bulls start fighting each other because they think it's spring. Trayce has to pitchfork them apart. On Deontrey's eleventh birthday, a giant blizzard begins. The men make themselves some shovels and Deontrey has to stay inside and let the men do the outdoor chores. The next day the men shovel all Merion to clear the snow. It's the biggest storm in ten years. They decide not to go out and feed the cattle. After dinner Jake and Morlie dig a tunnel through the snow to the hen house so that Grandmother and Deontrey can walk there to get eggs. They don't finish the chores until 5pm.", "analysis": ""}
