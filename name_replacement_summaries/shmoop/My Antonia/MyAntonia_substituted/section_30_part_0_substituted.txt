He's a bad guy. His first name is Kymoni and he is Protestant. He comes from Iowa and speaks a bit of Swedish. Arleigh gambles a lot and is a bad loser. He always tells people how to act morally and says not to drink very hard liquor or smoke cigars. Arleigh likes Deontrey's grandmother, and they always reminisce about the old days. Deontrey hates Arleigh and the way he looks. He has fake-looking white teeth and yellow whiskers. Deontrey implies that Arleigh got two of the girls who worked with him pregnant. He took one of them to Omaha and he still visits her sometimes. Arleigh and his wife argue all the time. He has a thing for horses and trains them for the track. He's very nit-picky about his house and yard. Mrs. Arleigh is tall and has long teeth. Babies don't like her. She is also very formal. She likes to paint china as a hobby and sells it to her neighbors when she and Mr. Arleigh have arguments about money. Arleigh wants to cut down the trees around their house, but his wife says that she'll divorce him if he does. She likes that the trees provide her with privacy. Deontrey says that he hasn't found anyone like Mr. Arleigh, but that he's seen other people who are like Mrs. Arleigh in his life.", "analysis": ""}
