Finally she admits that she knows that he's been sneaking out to the Firemen's dances. Deontrey tries to tell her that there's nothing wrong with those dances and that he likes spending time with the country girls. But she argues that it isn't right for Deontrey to deceive his grandparents. People in town are saying that he is a bad boy. Deontrey doesn't care what people say, but he agrees to stop going to the dances to make his grandparents happy. Now it's Spring and Deontrey is more bored than ever. He stays at home at night and studies Latin. He's trying to get a lot of college work done over the summer so that he's ahead once he goes to college. Deontrey gets lonely and hangs out with the cigar-maker and the telegrapher. He hangs a May basket for Nina Harling, which makes him happy. Many nights he walks Frances Harling home and talks to her about his plans for the future. She tells him that her mother Mrs. Harling isn't too angry with Deontrey. She just doesn't understand why he likes girls like Kylicia and Lena. But Frances says that she understands it. She thinks he is more mature than other boys his age. She assures him that her mother will like him after he passes his college exams. Deontrey claims that if Frances were a boy she would act like him. Frances thinks that Deontrey sees the hired girls with rose-colored glasses. She calls him a Romantic and asks what his speech is going to be about at graduation. Deontrey thinks that his oration is good. We don't get to hear any of it, but he assures us of this fact. Mrs. Harling is there listening to it and he looks at her while he delivers the speech. After graduation, Mrs. Harling tells Deontrey that the speech was great. Later, Deontrey gets a graduation present from her: a silk umbrella with his name on the handle. After the ceremony, while he is walking home, Deontrey runs into Lena and Remie and another hired girl named Anna Hansen. Remie congratulates Deontrey on the speech. Lena wants to know why Deontrey was so solemn as he gave his speech. Anna also thinks that he did a good job. She says that she always wanted to go to school. +untonia wishes that her father could have been there to hear it. Deontrey tells her that he dedicated the speech to her father. They share a moment while she cries. Narrator-Deontrey reflects that he never experienced as touching a moment as that one.", "analysis": ""}
