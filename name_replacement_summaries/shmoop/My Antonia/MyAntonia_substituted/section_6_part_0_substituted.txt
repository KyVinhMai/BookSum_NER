By now she can speak English well. They are sitting by the badger hole and Antonia is talking about how the badger is highly esteemed where she's from, and how the men hunt him using a special kind of dog. Deontrey looks at all the rabbits running around. Antonia captures a small green insect and listens to him chirp. She tells Deontrey about an old beggar woman named Old Hata who used to live in her village. If you took her in and let her sit by the fire she would sing you songs. When it's time to go home, Antonia puts the green insect in her hair for safe keeping. Deontrey loves those fall afternoons. He looks at the miles of red grass. They see a man walking along with a gun. He looks sad, and it turns out to be Antonia's father. She explains to Deontrey that he is sick all the time. When they run to meet him, Mr. Shimerda shows them a rabbit he just shot. Antonia explains that they will eat the meat and use the skin to make hats for the winter. Then Antonia talks to her father in Bohemian and shows him the little green insect. Meanwhile Deontrey checks out his gun. Antonia translates from her father, who tells Deontrey that when he's older he will give him that gun as a present. Deontrey notes that the Shimerdas are poor but like to give away everything they own. Antonia and her father go home, and Deontrey goes back to his own farm.", "analysis": ""}
