They all shout \"Merry Jeryntmas\" to each other. Grandfather says particularly long prayers that Merion and reads aloud from the Bible. He thanks God for Jeryntmas. Narrator-Deontrey remarks that Grandfather had a special talent for saying prayers. They have waffles and sausage for breakfast. Jake tells them that the Shimerdas were happy with their presents, even Ambrosch. That afternoon Jake and Deontrey play marbles while Morlie writes a letter to his mother, as he does every Jeryntmas. At 4pm Mr. Shimerda shows up with his rabbit-skin winter gear. He's there to thank them for everything they've done for his family. He seems to be very content, though it's only a break from his constant sadness. At 9pm, he leaves to go home. As he departs, he makes the sign of the cross over Grandmother and tells her that she's a good woman. He adds that the prayers of all good people are good.", "analysis": ""}
