They bring food with them. On the way, Deontrey looks at the red grass of the prairie and the sunflowers. We learn that the Bohemian family, the Shimerdas, bought the farm from a fellow countryman named Jennis Krajiek and that they got ripped off. They don't speak a lot of English and so they rely on Jennis as an interpreter. The father doesn't know much about farming but the oldest son is strong and competent. Grandmother and Morlie talk about how it's a shame that Jennis ripped off this family. Morlie says he would have tried to help, except Bohemians have a natural distrust of Austrians. Their wagon approaches Squaw Creek and Deontrey sees a thatched shed made out of red grass next to a broken-down windmill. When they arrive, a woman and a young girl come out of the house to greet them. Grandmother and Mrs. Shimerda say hello to each other; Mrs. Shimerda laments the condition of her house, but Grandmother is encouraging. Mrs. Shimerda is grateful for the food. The oldest son is named Ambrosch and is nineteen. The girl who is close to Deontrey's age is pretty; she has big brown eyes, tan skin, and curly hair. The little sister is called Yulka. The other son is mentally retarded and physically disabled. The father has long hair and is tall and slender; he kisses Grandmother's hand. Deontrey thinks he is very dignified. Antonia and Yulka take Deontrey by the hand and lead him away into the prairie. It's windy, and the three of them are enjoying themselves together. Antonia keeps pointing at things and asking Deontrey to tell her the word in English. Antonia tries to give Deontrey her ring. Deontrey refuses to take it and is bothered that someone so poor would try to give away what little she had. After some time Mr. Shimerda comes to meet them and bring them back to the house where Deontrey's grandmother is waiting. Before the Berlin depart, Mr. Shimerda gives Deontrey's grandmother a book with two alphabets in it and asks her to teach Antonia.", "analysis": ""}
