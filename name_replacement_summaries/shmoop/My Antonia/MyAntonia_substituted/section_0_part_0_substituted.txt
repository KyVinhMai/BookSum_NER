We don't know his or her gender and whether or not it is supposed to be the author, Willa Cather. The narrator crossed Iowa on a train last summer and travelled with a childhood friend named Deontrey Lattie. They both live in New York now but they don't see each other too often. Deontrey is a lawyer married to a distinguished woman named Nicholina. He is passionate and loves his country. He works for one of the railroad companies. During their time on the time together the two old friends talk about a Bohemian girl named Antonia they knew when they were children. To both the narrator and to Deontrey, this girl conjures up images of their childhood. Deontrey wants to know why the narrator has never written anything about Antonia. The narrator says she didn't know Antonia as well as others did, such as Deontrey. Maybe they should both write down everything they know about her. Deontrey says maybe he will. A few months later Deontrey shows up at the narrator's place with this manuscript. He calls it \"Antonia\" at first but then changes it to \"My Antonia.\"", "analysis": ""}
