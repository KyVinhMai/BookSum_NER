They like to frolic about with Deontrey. One day Antonia comes into Deontrey's kitchen and excitedly announces that her father found friends, some Russian men who live nearby. She's happy that her father has finally laughed and smiled in this new country. Deontrey knows about these two Russians but has never met them. They are strange and aloof and go by the names Jennis and Pavel. They avoid Bohemian Jennis because he once cheated them in a trade. Pavel is tall and an anarchist and does not speak English, and he coughs a lot. Russian Jennis is short and fat and jovial and has curly hair. They both work as farm hands, on their own land and for hire to others. Everyone makes fun of Jennis because he keeps a cow as a milk source. Mr. Shimerda goes to see the Russians almost every night. He frequently takes Antonia with him. Their Russian is not all that different from the Bohemian the Shimerdas speak. One night, Deontrey and Antonia go together in Deontrey's pony to visit the Russians. The Russians have a log house and a melon patch. They find Jennis in front of a washtub. He takes the two of them to see his chickens and explains that he likes having his own cow because the milk is good for Pavel, who gets sick a lot. Jennis takes a wheelbarrow full of watermelons up the hill. Pavel is out somewhere digging a well. Deontrey gets to look around their house and he thinks it's nice. Jennis splits the melons and gives them to Deontrey and Antonia to eat. He says that in his country everyone eats them all the time. He looks at Antonia and laments that he if he had stayed home he would have a daughter to cook and clean for him. Then he says he left Russia because of a great trouble, but doesn't tell anyone what that means. Then Jennis looks around for something to entertain the two kids. He plays them music on his harmonica. When they leave, he gives them a sack of cucumbers and a pail of milk to take with them.", "analysis": ""}
