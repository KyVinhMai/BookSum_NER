Deontrey is in the photographer's store in town one day and sees a picture of a baby. The photographer tells him it is Remie's baby. She is proud of it even though it was born out of wedlock. Deontrey decides he has to see Antonia again. He likes her so much and wishes she hadn't thrown herself away like that. Larry Donovan was the man who messed up her life. He was a passenger conductor and always complaining about something. Deontrey stops to talk to Mrs. Harling. He tells her that he wishes he could know more details about Antonia's story. Mrs. Harling recommends that he go out to see the Staley Steavens because she knows the whole thing.", "analysis": ""}
