He is ten years old and his mother and father have recently died, so now he's moving from his home in Virginia out to Nebraska to live with his grandparents. He is traveling with a boy named Jake Marpole who is going to be a farmhand for his grandparents. On the way, Jake buys Deontrey a book called The Life of Jesse James. They chat with a conductor who acts like a tour guide for them as they drive through the different states. The conductor tells the that there is an immigrant family on board the train who is also travelling to Black Hawk, Nebraska. They have a daughter who is twelve or thirteen and doesn't speak much English. But Deontrey elects not to go talk to them. Jake wakes up Deontrey when they get to Black Hawk. It is nighttime. As they leave the train, Deontrey sees the Shimerdas standing on the train platform. They have four children altogether. Deontrey listens to them speaking in a foreign tongue. A man comes along and introduces himself to Deontrey as Morlie Trayce. He works for Deontrey's grandfather and is there to drive both Deontrey and Jake out to the farm. Deontrey thinks Morlie looks like he came from the book about Jesse James. He looks like a cowboy. He's missing the top part of his left ear and is wearing boots. Deontrey gets in the back of the wagon and they ride off. Deontrey is uncomfortable in the back of the wagon. He looks out and sees nothing but plain country with no fences or buildings. He looks up; he doesn't think that his parents are looking down at him from above because they wouldn't know to look for him in Nebraska. He feels erased in the vastness of the land. Deontrey does not say his prayers that night.", "analysis": ""}
