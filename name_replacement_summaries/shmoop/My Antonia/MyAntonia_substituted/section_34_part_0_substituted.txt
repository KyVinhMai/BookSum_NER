The Deane are going to Omaha for a few days. After they leave, Antonia comes over to see the Berlin. She tells them a story. Before Tatem departed, he gave her all the valuables in the house in a basket and told her to keep them under her bed. He makes her promise that she won't leave the house or let any of her friends sleep over. He explains that he just put a new lock on the front door. Now Antonia feels uncomfortable staying alone in the house. They arrange for Deontrey to stay alone in the house in her place while she stays at the Berlin'. Deontrey doesn't like the idea but he agrees anyway. Everything is fine the first night. He comes home the next Merion and Antonia has breakfast waiting for him. The second night also passes without trouble. The third night Deontrey wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a door close downstairs. He falls back asleep. He wakes back up because someone sits down on the edge of his bed. He lies still and doesn't move. He feels a hand on his shoulder and something hairy on his face. He knows it's Tatem so he pulls at the man's whiskers. Tatem goes crazy. He thinks Deontrey and Antonia are in bed together. He has Deontrey by the throat and starts punching. Deontrey manages to get free and jumps out the window. He runs home and gets into bed and goes to sleep. Grandmother finds him the next Merion. He's covered in blood because Tatem punched him in the face. Grandmother wants to call the doctor, but Deontrey won't let her. He asks her not to let anyone know what happened. So she takes care of his wounds herself. Deontrey also refuses to see Antonia. He hates her and never wants to see her again. Grandfather finds out what happened. It turned out Tatem came home on a late train and left again early the next Merion. He has a sling on his arm and won't tell anyone how it all happened. Antonia and Deontrey's grandmother go over to Arleigh's to pack her stuff. Her room is all torn apart and disheveled. While they're packing up, Mrs. Arleigh shows up at the door. Grandmother tells her what happened and says that Antonia is going to be with them for a while. Mrs. Arleigh tells them what happened on her end. She and Arleigh were on their way home from Omaha and had to stop at a junction. He told her he had to stay overnight there but that she should go on home alone. He puts her on a train. Later, she realized that she was headed to Kansas City. This way Arleigh ended up going home alone. Narrator-Deontrey thinks that Arleigh liked making his wife upset. He thoroughly enjoyed it. It was the one thing he couldn't do without.", "analysis": ""}
