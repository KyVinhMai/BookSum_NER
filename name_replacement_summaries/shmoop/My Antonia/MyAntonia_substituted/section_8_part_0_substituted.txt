Jennis tells Mr. Shimerda that he had to mortgage all his stuff to pay a bill to Tatem Arleigh, a terrible moneylender who lives in town who took advantage of Jennis on interest rates. Then Pavel hurt himself working and is now laid up in bed. Everyone says the Russians have bad luck. One day Antonia and her father come to the Berlin' to get some buttermilk. Before they leave, Russian Jennis drives up. He says Pavel is very sick and wants to see Mr. Shimerda and Antonia. Grandmother lets Deontrey go along as well, and gives him sandwiches and doughnuts to take. Antonia and Deontrey ride together in the back of the wagon and huddle for warmth. Jennis groans that Pavel might die. Deontrey looks up at the stars and wonders what influence they have on earthly events. When they arrive, Pavel seems to be asleep. His breathing is labored. It's very windy outside and Deontrey can hear coyotes. Pavel cries out as though he's having a bad dream. Antonia tells Deontrey that Pavel is scared of wolves, because in his country the wolves eat people. Deontrey can't stop looking at the ghastly sight of Pavel. Jennis mixes the sick man some water and whiskey. Pavel drinks it. Finally Pavel tells Mr. Shimerda a long story in Russian which Deontrey cannot understand. Antonia listens and holds Deontrey's hand the whole time. She tells Deontrey that the story is about wolves. Pavel gets all worked up as he tells it. He coughs up blood and then falls asleep. Jennis drives the guests home. On the way back, Antonia repeats the story to Deontrey. When Jennis and Pavel were young men in Russia they were groomsmen for a friend getting married. After the wedding everyone had to travel by sledge over to the after-party. After the party everyone had to go home by sledge; by then it was late at night. It was winter and there were lots of wolves everywhere. On the way home all the sledges were attacked by a huge pack of wolves. Jennis and Pavel were driving the sledge with the groom and bride in it, and they tried to get the groom to throw the bride over so as to lighten their load and let them outrun the wolves. When the groom refused, they threw both him and the bride overboard to save their own lives. Jennis and Pavel ended up being the only survivors, but they were then pariahs in their town and so they left and came to America. End of the story. Pavel dies several days later. Jennis buries him, sells all their stuff, and goes off to work as a cook. The Berlin buy some of the stuff he auctions off. Jennis looks depressed the whole time. Supposedly he kissed his cow before it was sold, but Deontrey doesn't know if this is true or not. Before Jennis leaves he eats the melons he had been saving for winter. Afterwards, Mr. Shimerda gets very depressed now that his two friends are gone. He often goes out to the empty log house and sits in it alone. Deontrey and Antonia never repeat the story of the wolves to anyone; they get a strange sense of pleasure out of this. Deontrey often dreams that he is in a sledge pulled by horses, just like in the story.", "analysis": ""}
