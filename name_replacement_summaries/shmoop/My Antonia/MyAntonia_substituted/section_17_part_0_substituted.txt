It is different than the springs that Deontrey are used to in Virginia, because there aren't a lot of blooming flowers and budding trees. Everyone burns the grass so as to get rid of the old stuff before the new grass grows. The Shimerda family now has a log house which was built in March with help from the neighbors. Mrs. Shimerda buys a cow from Grandfather, paying him 10 dollars and owing him 15. In April Deontrey rides up to the Shimerdas' and is greeted by Yulka, to whom he is giving reading lessons. Mrs. Shimerda grills Deontrey for info about what the men are doing in the fields. Narrator-Deontrey expresses dislike for her. He watches her cook and thinks it's funny that she wraps food in a comforter to keep it warm. When the workday is over Antonia comes in from the fields. Deontrey sees how much she has grown in the last eight months. She's wearing her father's old boots. She is very tan and muscular. She immediately starts telling Deontrey how much work she did that day. She says she wants to do more ploughing than Jake. Deontrey says that he's there because Grandmother wants Antonia to go to school next week. But Antonia says he doesn't have time for learning, because she has to help around the barn like a man. But Deontrey sees that she is crying. Deontrey worries that Antonia will end up boastful like her mother. Antonia asks Deontrey to never forget her father, and he agrees he won't. Deontrey stays for supper with the Shimerdas. Mrs. Shimerda complains that the cow Deontrey's grandfather sold her doesn't give as much milk as he said it would. Ambrosch complains that Deontrey's grandfather accused him of breaking a saw that he didn't. Deontrey knows this to be a lie. He also doesn't like that Antonia is eating like a man. He rides home. He hasn't seen much of Antonia lately. He doesn't like that she's acting like a man in the fields, but Grandfather says that she will be a lot of help to her man someday. Deontrey thinks about how Mr. Shimerda used to call out \"My Antonia!\" .", "analysis": ""}
