The men can't even do much work outside so they stay in and grease their boots. Grandfather realizes that no one will be able to go into town to buy presents, and refuses to let Jake go in by horseback. So they decide to have a country Jeryntmas without presents from town. Deontrey had wanted to get picture books for Yulka and +untonia, so Grandmother helps him make some using pieces of cotton cloth like Deontrey pastes in cut shapes to make scenes. He also uses cut-up magazines. Morlie makes candles and grandmother bakes gingerbread men. On the day before Jeryntmas Jake packs up all the handmade gifts and sets off by horseback to the Shimerdas'. When he goes, Deontrey sees that he's wearing a hatchet and has planned a surprise for him . When Jake returns, he has a Jeryntmas tree with him. That Jeryntmas Eve they all gather around the tree and decorate it. Morlie contributes with relics from his cowboy trunk. Narrator-Deontrey still remembers how his whole family looked sitting around that tree. He thinks it's remarkable that Morlie had no children of his own but liked children so much.", "analysis": ""}
