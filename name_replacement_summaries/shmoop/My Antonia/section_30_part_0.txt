He's a bad guy. His first name is Wycliffe and he is Protestant. He comes from Iowa and speaks a bit of Swedish. Cutter gambles a lot and is a bad loser. He always tells people how to act morally and says not to drink very hard liquor or smoke cigars. Cutter likes Jim's grandmother, and they always reminisce about the old days. Jim hates Cutter and the way he looks. He has fake-looking white teeth and yellow whiskers. Jim implies that Cutter got two of the girls who worked with him pregnant. He took one of them to Omaha and he still visits her sometimes. Cutter and his wife argue all the time. He has a thing for horses and trains them for the track. He's very nit-picky about his house and yard. Mrs. Cutter is tall and has long teeth. Babies don't like her. She is also very formal. She likes to paint china as a hobby and sells it to her neighbors when she and Mr. Cutter have arguments about money. Cutter wants to cut down the trees around their house, but his wife says that she'll divorce him if he does. She likes that the trees provide her with privacy. Jim says that he hasn't found anyone like Mr. Cutter, but that he's seen other people who are like Mrs. Cutter in his life.", "analysis": ""}
