The Old Woman suspects that a reverend friar who slept at their inn is the thief. They sell one of the horses for money and travel to Cadiz. In Cadiz, the group encounters troops assembled to depart for Paraguay to suppress rebellion. Candide impresses a general with his proficiency at the Bulgar military drills. The general appoints him an infantry captain and ships him off with Cunegonde and the Old Woman. On the boat, the three travelers briefly have a \"My life sucks more!\" \"No, mine does!\" fight until they all agree on one thing: maybe it's time to consider doubting Pangloss's life philosophy of Optimism.", "analysis": ""}
