A Jesuit priest sprinkles saltwater over the supposedly dead Baron as a blessing, but sees the Baron's eyes flicker. Fortunately, the Jesuit cares for the Baron and restores him to health. The Baron trains as a colonel and as a priest and travels to Latin America. The Baron finishes telling his life story. Back in the present, the Baron asks Candide where his sister is and the men decide to rescue her together. Candide explains that he intends to marry Cunegonde. In a fit of rage, the Baron attacks Candide for his insolence and presumption in thinking that he is worthy of her in light of his ancestry. Candide thinks fast and kills the Baron by stabbing him. Then Candide thinks things through a bit. After several deep and contemplative minutes, Candide realizes what he's done. He feels remorseful. Also terrified. Cacambo quickly dresses Candide in the Baron's clothes and the two escape on horseback in disguise.", "analysis": ""}
