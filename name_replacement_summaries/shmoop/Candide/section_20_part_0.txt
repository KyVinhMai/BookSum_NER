Martin expounds rather humorously on the different places of the world: France is full of fools and lovesick madmen, and Venice is no good unless you're from Venice. He also declares that the world was created \"to make us mad.\" He makes a fantastic argument that men have always been evil and horrible to one another. Candide's tries rather poorly to negate this argument with free will.", "analysis": ""}
