Although he is without want, the count expresses discontent with his relationships with women, the Raphael paintings that decorate his home, the music being played for him, opera, philosophy, and almost all of the great literature housed in his extensive library. He even knocks Homer for his \"repetition,\" Virgil for being \"flat and disagreeable,\" and Horace for his \"indelicate verses.\" Candide tries to tell Martin that this man is happy, since he is superior to all that he owns. Martin tells Candide he's wrong.", "analysis": ""}
