Martin, on the other hand, is hopeless. He believes that people are inherently evil. Martin reveals that he is a Manichaeist. Manichaeism was an antiquated religion that believed in light and darkness, good and evil. As Martin continues his argument that the world's dark side has taken over, they witness a battle taking place between a Spanish ship and a Dutch pirate ship. This supports his argument. Turns out, the pirate ship belongs to that jerk Vanderdendur who stole Candide's jewel-laden sheep. Just then, Candide spots one of those sheep floating toward his boat in the water. Candide, in an outburst of logic, suggests that, since he found the sheep, he will definitely find Cunegonde again.", "analysis": ""}
