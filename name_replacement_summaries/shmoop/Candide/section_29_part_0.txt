Although the thought of making love to Cunegonde in her current state is really unappealing to Candide, he marries her as a matter of principle. Candide and his friends acquire a farm where they live together. Despite having finally achieved his goal, Candide is unhappy. Cunegonde isn't attractive anymore, and she and the Old Woman are grumpy. Everyone suffers from profound boredom. Pangloss maintains his \"best of all worlds\" stance, but it seems like his heart just isn't in it anymore. One day, Paquette and the monk show up in utter despair. The entire gang seeks the knowledge of a dervish. They basically say, \"We are the most unenlightened group ever. Help.\" The dervish says something like, \"Yes, you are. I cannot help you.\" But he does toss out an interesting question: \"When his highness sends a ship to Egypt, does he trouble his head whether the mice on board are at their ease or not?\" He then says the best thing to do is stop talking. Pangloss tries to argue about cause and effect, and has the door promptly slammed in his face. Confused, the gang returns to their farm. On the way, they encounter another farmer who invites them into his home. The farmer, also referred to as \"an honest Turk,\" remarks that he has found that working helps him to overcome \"the three evils\": boredom, vice, and poverty. Candide and his gang take the farmer's advice and dedicate themselves to working. Life seem to go better for everyone. Pangloss starts to philosophize, but Candide responds by saying they must \"cultivate garden.\" Pangloss tries to philosophize about that, too, but Martin tells them all to stop talking and do their work. Just when you think it's over, Candide has to cut Pangloss off yet again and tell him to cultivate the garden already.", "analysis": ""}
