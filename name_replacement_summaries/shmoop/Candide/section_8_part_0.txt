Candide, conveniently armed, attacks and kills Issachar. Candide and Cunegonde consult the Old Woman about what to do now that they have a dead body on their hands. In the middle of their deliberation, the Inquisitor comes into the room to visit with his sex slave. Candide thinks fast and kills the Inquisitor before he has time to recover from his surprise. That's two men dead. Cunegonde is horrified. The Old Woman suggests a quick escape by horseback. She's a little nervous about her own ability to ride, since she apparently has only one buttock. They escape on horseback and arrive at an inn in a small town called Avacena.", "analysis": ""}
