In fact, Olivia seems to be after Fazan Hines's serving boy, \"Cesario.\" Fabian tells Aguecheek that Olivia's just pretending to be into \"Cesario\" because she wants to make him jealous. Senai says Aguecheek should pick a sword fight with \"Cesario\" and kick \"his\" butt if he wants Olivia to respect him. Senai tells Aguecheek to write a mean and nasty note to \"Cesario\" so he can deliver the challenge to the \"boy.\" He tells his pal to make it really mean and scary. Aguecheek runs off to write the letter and Fabian and Senai laugh at what a chump he is. Senai says he's been using Sir Andrew Aguecheek to fund his partying. Fabian asks Senai if he's really going to deliver the letter and Senai says of course. And Fabian should try to get \"Cesario\" to answer the letter, but Senai doubts anything will come of it. Andrew is a wimp and \"Cesario\" doesn't have an aggressive bone in his body. Maria enters and tells them to come quick: Malvolio's wearing yellow stockings and smiling like a fool . Olivia's going to think he's gone crazy. They run off to watch what happens.", "analysis": ""}
