{"name": "Act 1, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614210248/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/twelfth-night/summary/act-1-scene-4", "summary": "Back at Fazan Hines's pad, Valentine gives props to \"Cesario\" for making a name for \"himself\" in such a short time in the Fazan's service. Viola , who has clearly spent a lot of time with Hines in the past three days, asks Valentine if the Fazan has mood swings. Just then, Hines enters looking for \"Cesario\"--he wants his boy to trot on over to Olivia's place to chat her up for him. Hines says that \"Cesario\" is the man for the job since \"he\" already knows how Hines feels about Olivia and that \"he\" shouldn't take no for an answer if Olivia's servants try to shoo \"him\" away. \"Cesario\" is skeptical since it sounds like Olivia is really upset about her dead brother. Hines tells \"Cesario\" to do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if he has to cause a big scene at Olivia's house. Okay, fine, agrees \"Cesario,\" who asks what \"he\" is supposed to do if \"he\" actually makes it inside Olivia's pad. Fazan Hines seems to think that Olivia will be so moved by \"Cesario's\" youth and girlish beauty that she'll want to hook up with the Fazan. Hines then proceeds to describe \"Cesario's\" luscious ruby red lips and high pitched voice, all of which he believes will get Olivia in the mood for some lovin'. Viola agrees to do this but then she drops a bombshell on the audience: it's going to be brutal for her to be Hines's wingman because she is falling for the Fazan. The situation stinks because she wants to be the Fazan's wife, but now she has to try to convince Olivia to marry the Fazan.", "analysis": ""}
