Furthermore, politicians are trying to make each other look bad by calling each other communists. This means that all European political powers agree that communism is a great power, too, Karl says. Yeah, he's exaggerating here, but what's the point of writing a manifesto if you're not going to use some rhetorical devices? Plus, who wants to get in a political movement that isn't fabulous?
