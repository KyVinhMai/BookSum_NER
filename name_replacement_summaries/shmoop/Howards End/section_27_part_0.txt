{"name": "Chapter 28", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219165520/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/howards-end/summary/chapter-28", "summary": "Margaret spends hours thinking over everything that's happened, then writes a bunch of letters. The first is to Henry; she writes it instinctively, saying that everything will be fine between them, then edits it according to his taste. He's clearly changed her. Margaret then reevaluates, and wonders if she really can deal with the fact that Mr. Wilcox had an affair with Jacky. She tears up the letter she just wrote. Next, she writes a brief note to Leonard, saying that Mr. Wilcox can't get him a job. She also writes a letter to Helen, telling her that they found Jacky drunk, and that the Basts are not worth her while - she should ditch them, and come to stay with the Wilcoxes at the house. Margaret feels like she's handling the matters in a practical fashion. She delivers the letters to the hotel herself, and sees Helen watching her through the window. She goes to inform Henry of what she's done, telling him that Helen is coming to spend the night. They act like nothing's happened, but obviously, something important has. Margaret tries to decide if she can stay with Henry or not. She goes back and forth between anger and pity - and ultimately decides to forgive him.", "analysis": ""}
