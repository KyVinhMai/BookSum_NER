She openly disobeys him for the first time, and feels like this is a fight of women against men. The doctor then tries to intervene, saying that Helen might be having a nervous breakdown. Margaret turns away both of them, saying that she and Helen don't need them - her sister still has a long while before the baby's due. Margaret appeals to Henry, saying that it's all about love - she cares for Helen, and neither of them do. The men give in and depart; Henry is confused by all of this, and Margaret tells him she will meet him at Charles and Dolly's. Margaret goes back into the house, where she confronts Helen.", "analysis": ""}
