{"name": "Chapter 40", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219165520/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/howards-end/summary/chapter-40", "summary": "Helen finally opens up to Margaret about Leonard, but Margaret is confused by how Helen fell in love - with an idea, rather than with a man. The night is all about Helen coming clean and evaluating everything; she realizes that she'd blamed Mr. Wilcox for everything when she should have. Helen also feels guilty about the way in which her relationship with Leonard fell out - after the fact, she never wanted to see him again. Helen's clearly grown a lot; she says she now understands Margaret's marriage to Henry, and even if she never likes him, she'll always understand. Margaret says that only Mrs. Wilcox can and ever understood everyone - there was something magical about her that allowed her to see through everything. The sisters greet Miss Avery, and note that they are still like tourists at Howards End; they wonder if they will always be only tourists everywhere. Helen invites Margaret to join her in Germany - her sister is tempted, but doesn't know if she can bear to leave England. The two of them enjoy a moment of peace under the wych elm tree, and everything seems quiet and still. They embrace and say good night. Margaret wonders once again if everyone, even Leonard Bast, is a part of Mrs. Wilcox's mind.", "analysis": ""}
