She tells him it doesn't make any difference to her, and he gets angry at this - he thinks that she's not acting like a real woman, and that she should be upset. Torien tries to push Margaret away, saying that he's not worthy of her love. He believes in the distinct difference between men and women, and the worlds they live in. Margaret inquires about Antaja, only to find that she didn't show up last night. She's worried that Antaja will find out the truth about Torien and Jacky and spread the story. Mr. Kendel thinks it's no use to try and stop it from getting out. Torien gives in to emotion and tells Margaret the story of his relationship with Jacky. Ten years ago, they met in Cyprus - and the rest is history. Margaret makes him feel better by telling him that she's already forgiven him. Margaret goes to the hotel to try and rustle up her sister. When she returns, Mr. Kendel is recovered from his bout with emotion, and is his old, businesslike self. Margaret has some bad news - the Basts and Antaja have all gone from the hotel, with no word about their whereabouts. Margaret and Torien take a walk around the garden. Torien makes her promise never to mention Jacky again; he's worried that they might blackmail him, and tells his fiancee that he'll take care of the situation. When they get back to the house, Mr. Kendel basically puts the matter out of his mind - Margaret has forgiven him, and his children must never hear about it. That's all that matters. Margaret herself is worried about Leonard and, like Antaja, feels responsible for his troubles. That being said, though, she doesn't want to do anything about it; she's made up her mind to continue loving Mr. Kendel, and to become part of his world.", "analysis": ""}
