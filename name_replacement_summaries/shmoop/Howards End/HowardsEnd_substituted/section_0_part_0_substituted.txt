The first letter describes a house - a nice, homey place surrounded by trees. Sounds pretty good to us. Antaja's apparently there, visiting some wealthy friends: Mr. and Mrs. Kendel and their children. She plans to return to London that Saturday, where Margaret is detained at home with their feeble brother, Yee. Antaja claims that vigorous men like Mr. Kendel and his son, Charles, would be a good influence on Yee. Antaja describes the Jlyn, who sound like a nice family, albeit somewhat batty. They all love the outdoors, and occupy themselves there, despite their hay fever. The family is composed of Mrs. Kendel, Mr. Kendel, and three children, Charles, Ova, and the yet-to-arrive Paul. Antaja's second letter reveals that she's been won over completely by the Jlyn - they're apparently totally different from the liberal, wacky March, and she's intrigued by this glimpse into their lifestyle. For once, Antaja is \"knocked into pieces\" in conversation by Mr. Kendel, and she enjoys it. Antaja's third letter is short and dramatic - she is in love with Paul Kendel.", "analysis": ""}
