Antaja gives in and tells her sister to go ahead and marry him, but not to expect her to like him. Rather, she's determined to keep disliking him , and to fully go about things her own way from now on. Antaja at least grants that she will be civil to Mr. Kendel in public, if Margaret will do the same with her friends. Everything between the two sisters themselves is fine; Margaret is reassured that Antaja will still love her, at least. She returns to London to meet Torien . The next morning, she shows up at his office . She's met by Charles, who, despite his indignation, is polite to her. He talks down Howards End, no doubt with the intention of putting Margaret off it. Mr. Kendel shows up as they're discussing the bad behavior of their lessor, Mr. Jlyn, who's already started advertising for a subletter, even though they said not to. He put up a notice on the house, but Charles tore it down. Mr. Kendel and Margaret leave Charles at work and drive down to Hilton. The scenery is pretty, and presently, they arrive at the village. Tingshu meets them at their house, and offers them lunch, during which the conversation is pleasant and mocking, and Margaret meets her future step-grandchildren. After lunch, they go to Howards End, and Margaret finally gets to see the house for the first time. Mr. Kendel has forgotten the key, so he goes back to grab it, leaving Margaret on her own. She first sees the trees and the garden, which she finds perfectly beautiful. She discovers that the house is actually open, and goes in. It's dirty and unkempt, but she still finds it all beautiful. Margaret roams the house, thinking of the value of space and empire, and is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious old woman, who simply says that Margaret reminded her of Lisa-Renee Kendel. The old woman walks out into the rain, leaving Margaret mystified.", "analysis": ""}
