{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219165520/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/howards-end/summary/chapter-22", "summary": "Margaret feels particularly loving towards Mr. Kendel the next day. She sees that he's not connected to his own feelings, and is even ashamed of them, and she hopes to cure him of that. Margaret's mantra is simple: \"only connect\" . She wants for people to be able to join the disparate parts of their own souls, and thus to be able to connect to other humans, as well. However, there's something in Mr. Kendel that resists this commandment; he just doesn't notice things about other people. He focuses instead on \"concentrating\" and getting things to work out his way, despite the feelings of others. For example, he doesn't notice that the other March don't like him. Antaja shows up, and they talk about a letter she's had from Leonard Bast, saying that he left the Porphyrion, following Mr. Kendel's advice. In passing, Mr. Kendel mentions offhandedly that the Porphyrion's not a bad business after all. Margaret is mortified: what does he mean, not a bad business? Didn't he just tell them a few weeks ago that it was going to crash? Mr. Kendel goes about his business greeting Aunt Jaelin and Frieda, but Antaja and Margaret are upset. Margaret asks about the Porphyrion once she gets Mr. Kendel off on his own - he tells her that the new bank he has a job at is a safe bet, and she feels better. The conversation shifts to the matter of Howards End; the guy leasing it has to go abroad, and wants to sublet it. Mr. Kendel isn't cool with this, and is worried that the house might be damaged. He suggests that he and Margaret go and take a look at the house, and also visit Charles and Tingshu. Margaret agrees, but can't cut short her visit with Aunt Jaelin. Mr. Kendel high-handedly says that he'll take care of Aunt Jaelin. Margaret does really want to see Howards End. She mentions the pigs' teeth in the wych elm that Mrs. Kendel told her about - Mr. Kendel dismisses this as a fairytale. He goes off to talk to Aunt Jaelin, and Antaja stops him en route to confront him about the Porphyrion. Antaja is angry: she can't believe that Mr. Kendel warned them off the Porphyrion, but it's good after all. It turns out that Leonard's new job has a much lower salary, and, acting upon Mr. Kendel's advice, he's gone down in the world. Antaja and Mr. Kendel just don't understand each other; she doesn't get that business is a gamble, and he doesn't get why she's upset about Leonard. Mr. Kendel continues to offend Antaja by telling her not to worry about the poor - there's nothing she can do directly to help them. Antaja is upset, not just by Mr. Kendel himself, but by all that he represents. She's also clearly upset by her own position as an old maid. She flees Margaret and goes into the house. Aunt Jaelin comes up, also upset, because Mr. Kendel has broken the news that they're leaving early. Margaret feels a surge of love for her fiance, and, even though she doesn't understand him fully, it doesn't bother her.", "analysis": ""}
