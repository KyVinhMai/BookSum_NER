She openly disobeys him for the first time, and feels like this is a fight of women against men. The doctor then tries to intervene, saying that Antaja might be having a nervous breakdown. Margaret turns away both of them, saying that she and Antaja don't need them - her sister still has a long while before the baby's due. Margaret appeals to Torien, saying that it's all about love - she cares for Antaja, and neither of them do. The men give in and depart; Torien is confused by all of this, and Margaret tells him she will meet him at Charles and Tingshu's. Margaret goes back into the house, where she confronts Antaja.", "analysis": ""}
