Margaret is anxious, and Mr. Kendel wants to go spring on Antaja without her. Margaret runs to the washroom to gather herself, and Mr. Kendel sneaks out without her, telling Tingshu to make an excuse. The car starts on its way, but Tingshu and Charles's little boy accidentally sits in the middle of the driveway, causing the chauffeur to swerve off course. Tingshu screams, and Margaret comes running out. Margaret confronts Torien about his attempt to cut her out of the plan, and he apologizes. The apology is accepted, and they embark again. The car stops to pick up the doctor, and Torien emphasizes how important it is not to scare Antaja. The doctor and Torien discuss Antaja's case dispassionately, and Margaret is infuriated by the way they're busily labeling her character, as though she's not even human. Margaret is determined to be on Antaja's side, since it's obvious that nobody else is. Antaja is innocently waiting on the porch at Howards End. Margaret runs out of the car before Torien can stop her, and rushes to her sister. She discovers immediately why Antaja has been avoiding everyone - she's pregnant. In a rush, Margaret unlocks the door and pushes Antaja into the house, then calls out to Mr. Kendel that everything is OK.", "analysis": ""}
