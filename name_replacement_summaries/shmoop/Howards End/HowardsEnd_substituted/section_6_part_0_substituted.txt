Aunt Jaelin, being more - well, for lack of a better word - normal than her nieces and nephew, always seems to be more up on the neighborhood gossip than they are, which is how she found out about the Jlyn. Aunt Jaelin and Margaret worry about the possibility of Antaja running into Paul. They decide that the March must be very careful with their new neighbors. Antaja laughs it off, and says that there's nothing to worry about. Frieda and Antaja go to meet Jem , and Margaret and Aunt Jaelin continue to worry. Margaret expresses a theory that money makes everything easier - things couldn't possibly get too bad between the Jlyn and March because they are both wealthy, and they have their wealth to rely upon, even when other things fall through. Margaret and Aunt Jaelin go off on an errand . Margaret worries that, between the meddling Frieda and Aunt Jaelin, Antaja might be troubled again by the Jlyn. Just in case, Margaret checks in with Antaja, who says that it's absolutely fine that the Jlyn are there - she's traveling with Frieda for a while anyway.", "analysis": ""}
