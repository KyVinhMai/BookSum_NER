Tingshu has big news, but she's distracted for a bit as she relates the local gossip to Margaret. They discuss the new house, then Antaja, then Charles and Tingshu's financial situation . Finally, Tingshu remembers what she came to talk about: Miss Avery, the old lady who takes care of Howards End, has started unpacking all of the March' belongings and laying them out in the house, even their books. At the mention of books, Margaret is in an uproar - some of them are Yee's, and are valuable. She's justifiably upset at Miss Avery, who has no right to open up all of their things. Tingshu thinks Miss Avery's just crazy, and says that she hates all of the Jlyn since Ova's wedding. Apparently, she bought Ova a wedding present that everyone thought was too expensive to accept, and when Ova returned it, she got terribly upset and threw it into the pond. Torien, apparently, knew about Miss Avery's battiness, but still wanted her to look after Howards End; he has infinite patience for people who are good at what they do. After asking Torien's permission, Margaret writes a note to Miss Avery, asking her not to touch any of her things. She goes to Howards End herself to sort out the unpacked books situation and store them elsewhere. Though Yee promises to go, he unsurprisingly backs out in the end, leaving his sister to visit the house alone.", "analysis": ""}
