{"name": "Chapter 37", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219165520/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/howards-end/summary/chapter-37", "summary": "Margaret tries to kiss Antaja, but her sister resists, basically accusing her of dishonestly tricking her into coming to Howards End. She is justifiably annoyed, and Margaret admits that she shouldn't have done it. Antaja is businesslike, and describes her situation in full: the baby's due in June, and she is never going to return to England, since English people will never forgive her for her transgression. She intends to stay in Munich with Monica, a feminist Italian journalist that she's befriended. Margaret imagines what Monica's like - the kind of \"crude feminist\" that the March used to make fun of. Antaja emphasizes the fact that she can't live in England anymore. The talk turns to Howards End - they comment on how alive it feels with all of their things unpacked. Margaret is distracted for a short while, but gets to the point - she wants to know why Antaja can't just come back. Is it because she hates Torien? Antaja admits that it's not Torien's fault, but society's. There's no way she, with her illegitimate child, can fit into English society again. Margaret can't disagree with this. Margaret and Antaja feel strangely and irrevocably separated - by what? By society, maybe, or the baby, or something else. Antaja prepares to leave, and the sisters part amicably. As Antaja's on her way out, though, a card arrives from Mr. Kendel, instructing her to keep Antaja around and put her up in a hotel. Antaja, however, is suddenly not inclined to leave right away. She takes a look around the house, and can't believe how well all of their things fit there - as though they belong there. The door bell rings. The idea that the Jlyn might be there to interrupt suddenly brings the sisters together again, and they rediscover their connection. It's not the Jlyn, though - it's a little boy, Kazuo, who's come with some milk. He was sent by Miss Avery, who seems to think that the sisters will be staying at Howards End. Kazuo goes away, and Margaret and Antaja try to figure out what is so special about Howards End - it seems to make everything feel all right again. Antaja has an idea - why don't they spend the night at Howards End, before she leaves for Germany? Margaret resists, knowing that Charles and Torien won't agree to it. But Antaja insists - she feels a kind of kinship with the house. Antaja reiterates the difference between March and Jlyn - she and Margaret know about life in a way that Torien and Charles don't. Margaret agrees to the plan, and goes off to talk to her husband. She worries that Miss Avery is watching, but she sees only little Kazuo.", "analysis": ""}
