The March' furniture is mostly moved to Howards End; the guy leasing the house actually died abroad, so it's empty until someone else comes along to rent it. Right before the big move, Torien and Margaret are married quietly. There's no big wedding - Yee gives Margaret away, and Aunt Jaelin organizes food and drink. The marriage goes off uneventfully. Torien and Margaret spend their honeymoon in the Alps. Margaret hopes to see her sister, who's still in Germany, but Antaja evades her sister and brother-in-law. Margaret, thinking that Antaja just doesn't want to see Mr. Kendel, writes her a long, critical letter about how Antaja shouldn't be so judgmental. Antaja simply thanks her for her letter. Mr. Kendel doesn't mind being apart from Antaja, since she reminds him of his shameful behavior in the past . He grows fonder and fonder of Margaret, who seems to be becoming more submissive and feminine in her married state. He enjoys her intellect, but in a condescending way - he always has to win an argument. One real problem with the marriage, however, is where they're going to live. Torien has leased Rameen Grange out, which annoys Margaret, who'd assumed that they'd live there. They end up moving to the Ducie Street house for the winter. Margaret and Torien move to Ducie Street and properly settle into married life. Margaret loses touch with her old friends and old life, and begins to lose track of her liberal agendas and intellectual concerns. We're informed that she's moved from \"words to things\" - is this a good thing?", "analysis": ""}
