{"name": "Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219165520/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/howards-end/summary/chapter-12", "summary": "It turns out that Margaret didn't know about Mrs. Kendel's bequest after all. She feels undone by her friend's death, and contemplates the way in which she disappeared from the world. Margaret also thinks over the funeral - it was nothing but a ceremony, with nothing to do with Mrs. Kendel's actual death. Finally, she also thinks a lot about the Jlyn, who she can't understand; they live in a completely different world than her family, and she can't blame them for it . Margaret and Antaja exchange letters . Antaja is unaffected by Mrs. Kendel's death - she's a little sad, but that's it. Antaja returns from Germany, and has had another marriage proposal, which she rejected. The March' cousin Frieda keeps trying to set them up with potential German spouses to bring them back to their original homeland. Yee also has news - he's getting ready to go to Oxford, and he loves it for its aesthetic qualities. We get the feeling again that Yee is rather an odd duck. Margaret interrupts the pleasant family banter to bring up the Jlyn. We can tell from what she says that they made an effort to see if Mrs. Kendel had told Margaret about leaving Howards End to her - obviously she didn't, and obviously they're not going to tell her. Mr. Kendel ended up giving Margaret a silver vinaigrette to remember Mrs. Kendel by. Antaja isn't interested. She pauses to be polite, then goes on talking about her Germany trip. Margaret sees that life isn't as linearly organized as history makes it seem; one can never really be prepared for things. She resolves to be less cautious in the future.", "analysis": ""}
