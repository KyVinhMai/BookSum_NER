He tries immediately to take control, and treat her like an ignorant, submissive wife - but she'll have none of that. Margaret tries to jump straight in with her request about Howards End, but Torien's not done. He wants to know who Antaja's \"seducer\" is, and Margaret doesn't know - she didn't even ask. Torien has tried to rally all of the menfolk; he called Charles to tell him about the situation, and Charles, in turn, is paying Yee a visit. They intend to make Antaja's lover marry her, or to otherwise punish him. Margaret gets to the point. She tells Torien that Antaja's going to Munich tomorrow, but would like to sleep at Howards End that night. This is a more difficult question for him than it seems like it should be - he doesn't understand the impulse. Margaret tries to explain that Antaja wants to be among their things, as a kind of end to her youth and innocence. Torien jumps to a negative conclusion - if Antaja stays there one night, maybe she'll never leave. This offends Margaret, who's upset about the implication. Would it be so bad if Antaja stayed? Margaret reveals that she wants to stay in Howards End with Antaja, which upsets Torien even more. The two of them find themselves at an impasse. Margaret is at the end of her rope. She demands that Torien answer her plainly, and restates all of the facts - can't he forgive Antaja for having a lover, since Margaret has forgiven him for Jacky? Can't they just spend one night in Howards End? Torien refuses, saying that he has to be respectful to his children and the first Mrs. Kendel - Antaja can't stay. Margaret, desperate, mentions Jacky again, then comes right out and accuses Mr. Kendel of all of his crimes - cheating on his first wife, casting Jacky off , not being responsible for Leonard's job. She tells him that he's done just the same thing that Antaja's done , but he just can't face up to it. Torien gathers his senses and flatly refuses once more, accusing Margaret of trying to blackmail him. He returns to the house; Margaret stays outside, fuming.", "analysis": ""}
