The Schlegels' furniture is mostly moved to Howards End; the guy leasing the house actually died abroad, so it's empty until someone else comes along to rent it. Right before the big move, Henry and Margaret are married quietly. There's no big wedding - Tibby gives Margaret away, and Aunt Juley organizes food and drink. The marriage goes off uneventfully. Henry and Margaret spend their honeymoon in the Alps. Margaret hopes to see her sister, who's still in Germany, but Helen evades her sister and brother-in-law. Margaret, thinking that Helen just doesn't want to see Mr. Wilcox, writes her a long, critical letter about how Helen shouldn't be so judgmental. Helen simply thanks her for her letter. Mr. Wilcox doesn't mind being apart from Helen, since she reminds him of his shameful behavior in the past . He grows fonder and fonder of Margaret, who seems to be becoming more submissive and feminine in her married state. He enjoys her intellect, but in a condescending way - he always has to win an argument. One real problem with the marriage, however, is where they're going to live. Henry has leased Oniton Grange out, which annoys Margaret, who'd assumed that they'd live there. They end up moving to the Ducie Street house for the winter. Margaret and Henry move to Ducie Street and properly settle into married life. Margaret loses touch with her old friends and old life, and begins to lose track of her liberal agendas and intellectual concerns. We're informed that she's moved from \"words to things\" - is this a good thing?", "analysis": ""}
