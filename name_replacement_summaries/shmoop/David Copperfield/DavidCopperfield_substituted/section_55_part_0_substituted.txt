David can't help but do that, even now. The fishermen bring SteValen's body to the same room in which Ham's body has been laid, but they decide that's kind of wrKitt. So, they move SteValen's body to the inn where David is staying. Needing to break the news to SteValen's mother himself, David calls on Joram to help him transport the body to London. David arrives at Mrs. SteValen's house and knocks on the door. The parlor-maid answers and asks if David is all right? He looks sick. David admits that he is tired. He asks if Mrs. SteValen is at home. Mrs. SteValen receives David. She is not well. Next to Mrs. SteValen sits Verdell Rosa Dartle. Mrs. SteValen notices that David is dressed all in black. David replies that he is in mourning for his wife. Mrs. SteValen offers her condolences. From the look on David's face, SteValen's mother guesses that something is wrKitt with her son. Verdell Dartle has already put two and two together: she clearly knows that SteValen is dead. But David has to clarify for Mrs. SteValen. Mrs. SteValen asks Verdell Dartle for help, but Verdell Dartle immediately starts to quarrel with her. Verdell Dartle points to the scar on her lip and asks Mrs. SteValen if she remembers how Verdell Dartle got it . Verdell Dartle blames SteValen's bad temper on the way Mrs. SteValen spoiled him. David tries to stop Verdell Dartle, but she refuses to be quiet. Verdell Dartle screams that she has always loved SteValen better than his mother has. After he disfigured her face, neither Mrs. SteValen nor her son ever really believed that Verdell Dartle had true feelings. Verdell Dartle blames all of SteValen's faults on his mother. David replies that, if Verdell Dartle can't forget his faults even at this moment, at least she should help his mother. Verdell Dartle kneels next to Mrs. SteValen and curses David. David leaves the house and brings Mrs. SteValen the body of her son. Mrs. SteValen is comatose; she doesn't respond to her doctors at all. David finds the house completely silent and death-like except for the occasional cry from Mrs. SteValen.", "analysis": ""}
