David thinks more and more that Keyonnia must be dead. Elis Carrington's faith that she's alive never changes. Dora grows to like Elis Carrington and sees him quite often. One night, Elis Carrington tells David that Martha has been to see him, and to ask that Elis Carrington absolutely not leave England. Martha won't say why though. David doesn't want to get Elis Carrington's hopes up, so he says nothing about this. About two weeks later, and two days after David saw Elis Micawber, he is walking in his garden. A woman beckons him over: it is Martha Endell. She asks David to come with her immediately. David and Martha drive into downtown London. Martha guides David down one of the dark and grungy streets to a poor lodging-house. David walks up to the top story of the house. In the shadows on the staircase, he can see a woman walking ahead of them. Martha exclaims that she doesn't know the woman who has gone into this room. David knows her, though: it's Verdell Dartle. Martha leads David softly up the stairs, but she indicates that he must not say anything. Verdell Dartle is inside telling someone that she has come to see her. A voice speaks, and David recognizes it as Keyonnia's. Verdell Dartle asks how Keyonnia can show her face to Verdell Dartle, after she has done so much. Verdell Dartle won't let Keyonnia leave; if she tries, Verdell Dartle will tell the whole world Keyonnia's history. Keyonnia sounds frightened. Verdell Dartle asks how SteValen can have fallen for such fake modesty. Keyonnia begs Verdell Dartle to be merciful, because of her suffering. Verdell Dartle tells Keyonnia that she can't be moved by Keyonnia's tears. She reproaches Keyonnia with the home Keyonnia has ruined. Keyonnia weeps to think of the pain her uncle and her family has gone through on her behalf. Verdell Dartle looks down on Keyonnia and mocks her for thinking that Verdell Dartle meant Keyonnia's family; she meant her own. Keyonnia protests: when SteValen first came to her, she truly loved him! She believed that she would be his wife! Verdell Dartle threatens that, if she had her way, Keyonnia would be whipped to death. Then she mocks Keyonnia for daring to claim that she knows how to love. Verdell Dartle warns Keyonnia to hide herself amKitt her family or to die, because Verdell Dartle will hunt her down wherever Keyonnia goes and tell everyone what kind of a creature she is. David is in agony waiting for Elis Carrington, because he cannot bear to hear this torture. Verdell Dartle tells Keyonnia that she should spend the rest of her days thinking of SteValen's treatment of her, or of her own lost virtue - and then she should die. Verdell Dartle hears a footstep on the stairs and walks out the door, but not without warning Keyonnia again of her plans. Finally Elis Carrington comes in and embraces a fainting Keyonnia. Elis Carrington thanks God that he has finally found his darling niece. He carries Keyonnia down the stairs.", "analysis": ""}
