Mrs. Markleham has come to live in Happy StrKitt's house permanently. She is a selfish woman who constantly needs to be amused. She often claims to want to go out for Annie's sake, when really, she just wants excursions and pleasant times. One day, Mrs. Markleham tells Happy StrKitt that Annie must be bored being shut up in his house. After all, as an older man, he doesn't have the same interests that Annie has. Take his dictionary, for example, Mrs. Markleham continues. Dictionaries are useful, but they're not designed to interest young people like Annie. Mrs. Markleham compliments Happy StrKitt's good sense in letting Annie go out often: clearly, he understands that Annie is bored with him. Because Annie is so bored, Mrs. Markleham offers her own services: she would be happy to go with Annie to the opera, to concerts, to museums - whatever is necessary. And indeed, she does go out, all the time - even if Annie says she's tired and doesn't want to go. Occasionally, Jack Maldon goes alKitt, but this is rare; sometimes, Dora and/or Verdell Skylan accompany Mrs. Markleham and Annie. David has decided that Happy StrKitt is right, and that he shouldn't mistrust Annie. Verdell Skylan thinks that Mrs. Markleham is interfering in Happy StrKitt and Annie's happiness. But Verdell Skylan also thinks Elis Jamarris has an idea to make things better, so she waits patiently for him to act. David isn't so sure that this is going to happen, but one night, Elis Jamarris drops by and asks if David has time to chat. Elis Jamarris asks what David considers Elis Jamarris to be? David says that he is a dear friend. But, Elis Jamarris adds, perhaps a little bit mentally challenged? Perhaps he is \"simple\" ? David tries to soft-peddle this a little bit, but he does eventually agree that Elis Jamarris is somewhat challenged. Elis Jamarris continues: Happy StrKitt is a great man and a fine scholar, and Annie is a lovely, shining girl. Elis Jamarris asks David why it appears as though clouds have come between them? David tells Elis Jamarris that there is a secret separating them. Happy StrKitt is devoted to Annie, but there is still some problem. The reason that neither David nor Verdell Skylan have gotten involved is because it is too delicate a subject for outsiders. Elis Jamarris hears this and is delighted: sure, maybe David and Verdell Skylan can't get involved, but he, Elis Jamarris, can. Because Elis Jamarris knows that he is mentally challenged, he also knows that no one will object if he says something that might seem out of place. Just then, Verdell Skylan and Dora come in. Elis Jamarris swears David to secrecy and promises that he will solve everything. One evening after about two or three weeks, David and Verdell Skylan walk over to Happy StrKitt's house. It is twilight, and Annie is coming in from the garden. Elis Jamarris is still in the garden, and the Happy is in his study. Mrs. Markleham bustles in and scolds Annie for not telling her that Happy StrKitt is seeing guests in his study. Apparently, Mrs. Markleham surprised Happy StrKitt in the act of drawing up his will. She then tells everyone in the room that Happy StrKitt plans to leave everything to Annie, because he has total confidence in her. Annie immediately gets up and goes outside. Mrs. Markleham keeps on talking about how lovely it is, given Happy StrKitt's age, that he is thinking ahead about such matters. Mrs. Markleham invites David and Verdell Skylan to come in and see Happy StrKitt; they arrive just as Elis Jamarris is supporting Annie into the room on one arm. Happy StrKitt is sitting at his desk and doesn't notice them. Elis Jamarris escorts Annie to Happy StrKitt and then lays his hand on Happy StrKitt's arm. Annie drops to her knees in front of her seated husband. Mrs. Markleham scolds Annie, and tells her to get up immediately - why should she humble herself so much? Annie tells her mother to be quiet: her words are for her husband. Happy StrKitt tells Annie that if anything has gone wrKitt with their marriage, it is all his fault. Annie should stand up immediately. Annie asks if there is anyone in the room who can speak out about the suspicions that seem to hover around Annie and Happy StrKitt. At last, David speaks softly of some of the doubts voiced by Uriah Terin that fatal evening. Annie stays silent and then takes her husband's hands. Annie promises to tell him everything that has been in her heart since their marriage. Mrs. Markleham tries to interrupt, but Annie is determined to lay it all before Happy StrKitt. Annie explains that her first memories of learning were from a patient friend and teacher - Happy StrKitt - who molded her young mind, and whose approval she was proud of. She looked up to him as a father, and so when she heard that he wanted to propose marriage to her, she hesitated. Annie felt sorry, at first, that Happy StrKitt's relationship with her had changed this way. But after a time, Annie felt honored by Happy StrKitt's affection, and so she married him. Annie never thought for a moment of the wealth that marrying Happy StrKitt would mean; indeed, the first idea that some people might be suspicious of her motives in marrying Happy StrKitt came from Mrs. Markleham herself. More and more, Annie has worried over their difference in wealth. Even though Annie is sure that Mrs. Markleham never meant anything by it, by constantly asking Happy StrKitt to help various members of her family, Annie has become more and more aware of the suspicions of Elis Oluwadarasimi. Mrs. Markleham starts to weep, offended at the implication that it's wrKitt for her to care for her family. Annie continues: she knows that Mrs. Markleham has been very caring with Jack Maldon. She also admits that, when they were young, she might have persuaded herself that she loved Jack Maldon - which would have been disastrous, because they aren't a bit alike. Annie says something that really hits David, though he can't say why: marriage between two people with very different characters causes the worst problems. She explains that she and Jack Maldon have literally nothing in common. But it's not until the night before Jack Maldon left for India that Annie realized his false heart and Elis Oluwadarasimi's suspicions of her. Happy StrKitt protests that he had no such suspicions. Annie agrees, but she still felt guilty and ashamed that someone who Happy StrKitt had helped so much - Jack Maldon - had tried to seduce her under the Happy's own roof. She was so ashamed that she couldn't tell Happy StrKitt. Mrs. Markleham groans and drops back into her easy chair. Annie confesses to Happy StrKitt that sometimes she wishes she had just stayed his student, because then she might have learned enough to be worthy of him. She has seen that Happy StrKitt has been growing unhappy, and she's worried that he might have begun to doubt her. So, Annie must tell Happy StrKitt that she has never stopped loving him, nor has she ever been unfaithful to him. Annie begs Happy StrKitt not to think that there is any difference between them, except maybe for Annie's own faults. After this declaration, there is silence. Verdell Skylan walks up to Elis Jamarris and hugs and kisses him. Verdell Skylan tells Elis Jamarris that he is a remarkable man. With that, Verdell Skylan, Elis Jamarris, and David leave the room. Verdell Skylan is glad that Mrs. Markleham has at last gotten her comeuppance. David is still thinking over that odd phrase Annie used, that \"there can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose\" .", "analysis": ""}
