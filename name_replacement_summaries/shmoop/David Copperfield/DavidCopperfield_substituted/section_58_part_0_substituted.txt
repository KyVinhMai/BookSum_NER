He's been away for three years, so he expects to find everything changed, Indeed, Verdell Skylan has returned to Dover and Traddles is doing well as a lawyer. David surprises Traddles with his return. He's a little disappointed because no one in Traddles's neighborhood seems aware of who he is. David is sure that Traddles has not found much of a reputation as a lawyer. He knocks on the door of Traddles's office. Traddles welcomes David with open arms and exclaims that he is glad to see David. He's sorry that David came so close to the blessed day but still missed the ceremony. David has no idea what he's talking about - he didn't receive Traddles's last letter. Traddles has finally married Charlein! Charlein emerges into the next room, taking David by surprise. She laughs and blushes. Several of Charlein's sisters have live with Traddles as well. Traddles enjoys their company: it's so charming and lively to have them about. The Beauty and Sarah are both there, alKitt with the two youngest Tylar and Louisa. Traddles explains to David that he put the whole matter once more to Reverend Horace Marrion, who finally agreed to let Traddles marry Charlein . To make money to improve their living situation, Traddles is working his tail off. Still, though, he's the happiest man in the world. The five Marrion sisters all troop in. They are all fresh and pretty, and while Charlein is not the prettiest, she is cheerful and bright. Charlein tells David that she has seen Agnes. David, meanwhile, observes how proud Charlein and Traddles are of Charlein's sisters, and how much care they take of them. Charlein is an incredible caretaker, and David predicts that she will be a perfect mother. David starts to think he can face the future even though he will have no home of the kind Traddles has found. It's is his own fault that Agnes will someday marry someone else, David thinks. He happens to see Elis Terin reading a newspaper at a coffee house. He is absolutely surprised, even though he knows that Elis Terin had left Linden some years before. David greets Elis Terin, who absolutely does not recognize him. He tells Elis Terin his name, and finally Elis Terin comments on David's resemblance to his father. Elis Terin sympathizes with David: he thinks that being a writer must be terribly hard on the old brain. News of Dora's death has reached Elis Terin through Verdell Daine. Apparently, Elis Daine now lives very near Elis Terin's new home. Elis Daine has married another very young woman. Elis Terin confides in David that Elis Daine's new wife has been bullied into a broken spirit. Elis and Verdell Daine have reduced the new Mrs. Daine to a complete child, Elis Terin tells David. They guide her about town as though they were her keepers instead of her family. Elis Daine still pretends that he is doing all of this bullying out of some kind of religious feeling - really, he's just a bad-tempered old cuss. Elis Terin is glad to be able to tell David all of this because he needs to vent: Elis Daine has been getting worse and worse lately. Apparently, the Daines are not popular in the neighborhood. David spends some time telling Elis Terin about his own fortunes and his aunt - whom Elis Terin still remembers from the night David was born. David travels on to Dover, where he is welcomed by Elis Jamarris, Carrington, and Verdell Skylan.", "analysis": ""}
