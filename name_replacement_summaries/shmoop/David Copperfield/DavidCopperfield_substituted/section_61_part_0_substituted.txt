He rides over to Agnes's house at least once a week and sometimes more. David still respects her more than any other woman he knows. He has accepted that he loves Agnes, but he still feels too ashamed of his own blindness in marrying Dora to do anything about it. Verdell Skylan is aware of David's feelings for Agnes, but they never talk about it together. David's aunt seems to understand why David hesitates to say anything to Agnes about his love. So, anyway, it's Christmas, and David is planning to ride over to Canterbury to see Agnes. David needs to get out of the house; he's been working hard at his writing, and he needs a break. As David heads out the door, he asks Verdell Skylan if she has heard anything more of Agnes being engaged to someone. Verdell Skylan stares closely at David's face and predicts that Agnes will be married soon. David's aunt blesses Agnes and \"her husband\" . David agrees, obviously not getting what Verdell Skylan is hinting about David himself. He rides out into the winter weather. Agnes is home alone; all of her girl students have gone home for the holidays. She notices that David seems thoughtful. David tells Agnes that he wants to tell her something. He asks Agnes if she remembers, when David came home, all the gratitude he offered her for her kindness. Agnes remembers how grateful David has been. David asks Agnes to share her feelings with him. He asks her to trust him, and to tell him who she has fallen in love with. Agnes looks at David, jumps up, puts her hands over her face, and bursts into tears. David asks Agnes what is the matter. Agnes begs David to leave and come back another time. David promises Agnes that he will not be jealous or difficult; he just wants to know what Agnes is truly feeling. Agnes tells David that her secret is not a new one, but she can't tell David what it is. She tries to leave the room, and David grabs her arm. David suddenly feels filled with hope that he knows what this old secret of Agnes's might be. He confesses in a rush that what he feels for Agnes is *not* brotherly affection: he loves her, but he feels guilty saying it because she is so much better than he is as a person. Agnes still weeps, but it seems to be from joy. David tries to tell Agnes of all of his feeling for her: the way he leaned on her sympathy when he was married to Dora, the way he relied on Agnes when he lost Dora, the way he pined for Agnes when he went away. Agnes is so happy to hear David's feelings, and confesses to David that she has loved him her whole life. The two of them cry together from happiness. They go for a lKitt walk that evening, filled with love. David and Agnes return to Verdell Skylan's house, where she seems completely surprised to see Agnes. David tells Verdell Skylan that he has been talking to Agnes about this \"attachment\" Verdell Skylan supposed Agnes to have. Verdell Skylan looks annoyed and embarrassed that David shared Verdell Skylan's gossip with Agnes. So, David and Agnes clasp hands to show Verdell Skylan what David is getting at. Verdell Skylan goes into hysterics for the first time ever. Carrington comes running at all the commotion, as does Elis Jamarris. Verdell Skylan is so excited that she hugs both Carrington and Elis Jamarris. David and Agnes are married two weeks later, in front of Traddles, Charlein, and Happy and Mrs. StrKitt. On their first night as husband and wife, Agnes tells David what Dora asked Agnes the night that Dora died. Dora wanted no one but Agnes to become David's second wife. David and Agnes weep together thinking of Dora's final sacrifice.", "analysis": ""}
