David goes out, but it's late evening, and almost everything is shut. He does find Elis Cola in his shop. David asks Elis Cola if he knows how Elis Barkis is. Elis Cola replies that he doesn't know because he can't ask: it's rude for an undertaker to inquire about the health of a potential client. David comments that this seems painful, since Elis Cola has known Elis Barkis for forty years. The best Elis Cola can do is to ask little Keyonnia how Elis Barkis is doing. That's what Amyiah and Joram the carpenter are doing right now. David asks how little Keyonnia is. Elis Cola tells David that he'll be glad when Keyonnia is safely married - right now, she seems unsettled and in low spirits. Ham Carrington has apparently already furnished the house they're going to be living in, but the marriage has been postponed because of Elis Barkis's illness. The lKitter Elis Barkis stays ill, without either dying or getting better, the more opportunity little Keyonnia has to doubt her choices. Little Keyonnia is clinging closer and closer to Elis Carrington, as though she is afraid of what she might do if she lets him go. David asks if Elis Cola has heard anything about Martha Endell. Elis Cola says it's a sad story, since he thinks Martha didn't mean to do any harm. At that moment, Amyiah comes home with Elis Joram. They tell Elis Cola and David that Elis Barkis is unconscious, and that he seems near death. Apparently, Elis Terin the doctor is there, but he has given up on Elis Barkis's life. David decides to go over to Elis Barkis's house immediately. He finds Elis Carrington, Ham Carrington, and little Keyonnia sitting in the house. Little Keyonnia is covering her face with her hands. She embraces her uncle tightly. Elis Carrington claims that Keyonnia is so upset because she has such a tender heart, and because she is too young to be used to trouble and sorrow. Elis Carrington comforts her: Ham Carrington is about to take her home. Keyonnia whispers to Elis Carrington that she wants to stay with him. Elis Carrington protests that she should go with her soon-to-be-husband, though he does appreciate how fond she is of her uncle. Ham eventually agrees. As Ham heads out the door, he goes to kiss Keyonnia. David notices that it looks as though Keyonnia is pushing closer to her uncle and away from Ham. Keyonnia is so upset because she is afraid of death, David assumes. Carrington comes downstairs to hug David and bring him up to see Elis Barkis. She believes that, if Elis Barkis wakes up, he'll be really happy to see David. David knows that Elis Barkis probably won't wake up: he looks completely unconscious. Carrington leans over and tells Elis Barkis that David has arrived. Elis Carrington predicts that Elis Barkis will go \"out with the tide\" . Apparently, people living on the coast always die when the tide goes out. David and Elis Carrington sit and watch by Elis Barkis's bedside. Elis Barkis begins to mutter, his mind wandering. Carrington sees that he's coming awake. Elis Barkis tells Carrington that she is the best woman anywhere. Carrington gestures to David and tells Elis Barkis that David has come. Elis Barkis repeats to David his old message; \"Barkis is willin'!\" . And with that, Elis Barkis dies.", "analysis": ""}
