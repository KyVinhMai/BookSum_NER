The time of his birth makes several local women predict that he'll be unlucky, and he'll be able to see ghosts. David hasn't been able to see ghosts so far, but as to the first part of the prediction , the rest of the novel will prove whether or not they were correct. David is also born with a caul . Continuing with his own birth, David tells us that he is born six months after the death of his father. The one person in David's family with any cash is his father's aunt , Skylan Climmie. Verdell Skylan had been married, to a complete jerk who she finally packed off to the Indian colonies . Her husband dies after ten years in India, at which point Verdell Skylan returns to title of \"Verdell\" and takes up a secluded life in a village on the seaside. David's father and Verdell Climmie used to be close, but Verdell Skylan doesn't like his father's marriage to David's mother. Verdell Skylan calls David's mother a \"a wax doll\" , because she's half the age of her husband, Elis Arleigh. Verdell Skylan and David's father don't see each other again before David's father dies. On that March Friday when David is about to be born, his mother sits by the fire feeling miserable, what with being pregnant, young, and alone in the world. David's mother sees a woman coming up to the house, and realizes that it is probably Verdell Skylan. David's mother invites Verdell Skylan in. His mother is dressed in black , very pregnant, and her face is red with weeping. She looks like a child. Verdell Skylan comments on her childlike appearance: \"Why, bless my heart! you are a very Baby!\" . Verdell Skylan then asks David's mother why she has called her house the Kitt? A rookery is a nesting place for rooks, a crow-like black bird. But Verdell Climmie can't see any birds. David's mother, Mrs. Arleigh, answers that the name came from Elis Arleigh, who saw birds' nests and thought there must be lots of rooks in the neighborhood. In fact, the nests are old, and Mrs. Arleigh has never seen a rook around the Kitt. Verdell Skylan thinks this is a perfect illustration of Elis Arleigh's character: he names a place the Kitt assuming that there will be rooks, without any proof that his house has come stocked with birds. Mrs. Arleigh seems to feel that this observation is an insult to Elis Arleigh, and stands up, apparently to attack Verdell Skylan. But then Mrs. Arleigh faints dead away. When she comes to, Verdell Skylan asks what Mrs. Arleigh calls \"her girl\" . Mrs. Arleigh replies that she's not sure her kid will be a girl. Verdell Skylan says, no, she meant Mrs. Arleigh's servant-girl. Mrs. Arleigh answers: Carrington. Verdell Skylan demands tea from Carrington for Mrs. Arleigh, who is not looking well. Verdell Skylan then tells Mrs. Arleigh she's sure the child will be a girl. Verdell Skylan insists that the child will be called Skylan Climmie Arleigh and that Verdell Skylan will be her godmother. She promises to look after Skylan Climmie Arleigh's education. Verdell Skylan then asks Mrs. Arleigh more about her life. Mrs. Arleigh tells Verdell Skylan that she was a nursery-governess for a family Elis Arleigh visited. He proposed to her and they were married soon after. Mrs. Arleigh admits that she doesn't know much about keeping house. Elis Arleigh left his wife and unborn child an income of 105 pounds per year. Verdell Skylan agrees that he could have done worse. The servant woman, Carrington, comes in with Mrs. Arleigh's tea and sees at once that she is not well. Carrington sends her nephew, Ham Carrington, for a doctor: the baby's on the way. In the meantime, Verdell Skylan sits in the parlor. The doctor arrives. Elis Terin goes upstairs to check on Mrs. Arleigh and then comes down again to sit with Verdell Skylan. Verdell Skylan is violently nervous, yelling at Elis Terin and shaking Ham Carrington, the servant-woman's nephew, in her agitation. Finally, Elis Terin comes to tell Verdell Skylan the baby has been born. He also brings her the news that the baby is a boy, not a girl, as Verdell Skylan had assumed. At this, Verdell Skylan hits Elis Terin with her bonnet and walks out the door without a word.", "analysis": ""}
