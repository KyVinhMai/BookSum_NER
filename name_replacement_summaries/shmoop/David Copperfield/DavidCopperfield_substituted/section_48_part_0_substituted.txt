The letter is from Elis Micawber. Elis Micawber writes that he has hit a run of bad luck, and that he wants to confide in his old friend. Elis Micawber has decided that he must take a brief vacation from Canterbury because life has become awful. He hopes that both David and Elis Traddles will meet him when he comes to London for two days. Elis Micawber stresses that Mrs. Micawber is unaware of his plan to come to the city. David is sure that there is something important going on in the letter, though Elis Micawber doesn't come out and say it. Traddles finds David because he has just received a letter from Mrs. Micawber. In it, Mrs. Micawber says that she is still unhappy about Elis Micawber's secretiveness with his family. Apparently, Elis Micawber is just growing more and more unhappy: he has said that he has sold his soul to the devil. Mrs. Micawber has figured out that Elis Micawber is planning a secret trip to London. She asks Traddles and David to meet with Elis Micawber and reason with him. Traddles thinks these letters are significant, but he can't think what's behind them. David writes a letter to Mrs. Micawber on behalf of both him and Traddles assuring her of their plan to meet Elis Micawber. Traddles and David go to meet Elis Micawber. Elis Micawber is looking less genteel and dapper than before. He seems low-spirited. He starts talking very formally to Traddles and David, and David asks him to relax. Elis Micawber is moved by David's affection. Micawber recalls those lKitt-ago days when he was an inmate in debtors prison. At least then, he could look his fellow men in the face! David finally asks Elis Micawber point-blank how Uriah Terin is. Elis Micawber says that he's a devilish horrible person. David then asks how Elis Oluwadarasimi and Agnes are. Elis Micawber says that Agnes is a lovely girl of superior character. Thinking of her is painful to Elis Micawber. David invites Elis Micawber to come out to Highgate and meet Verdell Skylan. There, Elis Micawber can tell Traddles and David all about his troubles. They all set off to Verdell Skylan's house because Dora is ill. Elis Jamarris shakes Elis Micawber's hand in a very friendly manner, which cheers up Elis Micawber a tiny bit. Verdell Skylan addresses Elis Micawber directly: she asks after Mrs. Micawber and his family. They are all well for now, but Elis Micawber is worried because he's about to lose his job. Elis Micawber keeps talking around the problem, saying that all is ruined and that everything is the matter. And it all comes back to one Uriah Terin. Elis Micawber has decided that he can no lKitter live this life; he wants to return to his family. Uriah Terin, Elis Micawber shouts, is a complete scoundrel. Micawber works himself into such a state over Uriah Terin that he rushes out the door. Still, in the midst of all his passion, he finds the time to write a letter: Elis Micawber apologizes to Verdell Skylan for his excitement that night. He asks for another meeting in a week's time at a restaurant in Canterbury.", "analysis": ""}
