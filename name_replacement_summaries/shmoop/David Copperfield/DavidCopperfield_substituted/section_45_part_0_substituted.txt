He happens to go past Mrs. SteValen's house. David sees the blinds drawn and the whole house shut up. He feels a bit depressed and doesn't notice anyone around him until suddenly, a woman's voice rings out. It's the voice of Mrs. SteValen's maid asking David to come in and have a word with Verdell Dartle. Verdell Dartle saw David passing and would like him to speak with her. The maid tells David that Mrs. SteValen is not well and stays in her room most of the time. Verdell Dartle looks disdainfully at David. She asks if Keyonnia has been found. She seems pleased to tell David that Keyonnia has run away from SteValen. Verdell Dartle hopes openly that Keyonnia has died. The woman asks if David wants to know what is known about Keyonnia's whereabouts? David answers yes. Verdell Dartle calls to Siah to come out. Siah informs David that he and SteValen have been abroad with Keyonnia. They have traveled through France, Switzerland, and Italy. Apparently, Keyonnia has been quick to learn the languages of these places and has been much admired wherever they went. Siah explains that, though they were happy for a time, Keyonnia grew more and more depressed, and her low spirits dragged down SteValen. After many arguments, SteValen finally left Keyonnia in Naples, Italy. But SteValen offered to arrange a marriage between Keyonnia and another man who wouldn't mind her past indiscretions. Once Siah explained to Keyonnia that SteValen had gone away, she tried desperately to kill herself. Siah continues: Keyonnia's behavior was awful, and Siah was sure that she would murder him if she got the chance. In the end, Siah locked her up with nothing at hand to hurt herself or anyone else. But Keyonnia still managed to escape by knocking the bars out of the window of her room and climbing down the wall. There has been no news of her since. Verdell Dartle smiles at the thought that she may be dead. Siah agrees that Keyonnia may have drowned herself, or she may have found a way to join the local boatmen. Apparently, after Keyonnia's escape, Siah went to meet with SteValen. SteValen injured Siah, and so Siah left SteValen's service and headed back to England to tell Mrs. SteValen and Verdell Dartle this news . Now, Siah is looking for another job. All David wants to know is if Keyonnia received a letter from home, or if he and SteValen intercepted it. Siah isn't willing to tell David straight out, but he strKittly implies that SteValen prevented Keyonnia from getting her letter from Elis Carrington. David finishes up by telling Siah that he plans to tell Elis Carrington this story, so Siah had better watch himself. Siah informs David that he is not afraid, and that this is a free country. SteValen's servant takes off. Verdell Dartle adds that SteValen is sailing off the coast of Spain. She tells David that they share a common goal: David wants Keyonnia saved, and Verdell Dartle wants to make sure that Keyonnia never has another chance to hurt SteValen again. Mrs. SteValen comes up behind Verdell Dartle and greets David. SteValen's mother reaffirms Verdell Dartle's suspicions that Keyonnia is going to try to get something more out of SteValen. David respectfully disagrees: Keyonnia, who has been so badly treated, would not accept a cup of water from SteValen now. Verdell Dartle looks like she wants to say something, but Mrs. SteValen stops her. Mrs. SteValen asks how David is - he's starting to get famous, she believes. David says that he has been lucky to get good reviews. Mrs. SteValen asks if David's mother is alive. She tells David that it's a shame, because his mother would have been proud of him. David shakes her hand and leaves. He now seeks out Elis Carrington, who happens to be in London, lodging at that place where Elis Jamarris stayed briefly. Elis Carrington greets David warmly. David passes on the news that he has heard from Siah: that Keyonnia has left SteValen. Elis Carrington asks if David thinks she is still alive? David thinks she is, and Elis Carrington agrees - he would know if she had died. David suggests that little Keyonnia might come back to London, having nowhere else to go. He asks if Elis Carrington remembers Martha Endell? Both David and Elis Carrington have seen her on the London streets. David tells Elis Carrington that Keyonnia used to be kind to Martha . David suggests that they should look for Martha to see if she might know where Keyonnia is. As they walk out to search for Martha, David asks after Ham Carrington. Apparently, Ham is still working too hard, but he's popular in the village. David worries that, if Ham ever finds SteValen, he might do something dangerous. Elis Carrington agrees that he has had similar concerns about Ham. David and Elis Carrington fall silent as they walk towards the lonely figure of a woman: it is Martha. They follow her through the London streets until she turns down a quiet alley.", "analysis": ""}
