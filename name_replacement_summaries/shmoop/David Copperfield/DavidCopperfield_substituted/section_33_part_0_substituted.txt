He also tells her about little Keyonnia's flight from Yarmouth, though he doesn't explicitly mention SteValen's name. While David had been away with the Jaydences, Jomarionmy Traddles had dropped by a couple times. Each time, he found Carrington at David's house. Jomarionmy Traddles and Carrington have become friends. While Carrington is staying with David, Mrs. Bergen refuses to do any of the housework because she can't stand Carrington. Traddles comes by once more and greets David warmly. David's old friend has heard of David's engagement, and reminds David of Traddles's own fiancee, the curate's daughter who is one of ten children. David sympathizes with Traddles because he gets to see his fiancee so rarely. Traddles's fiancee - Charlein - spends all of her time looking after the other nine children because her mother has become bedridden. David is impressed by the great care that Charlein takes of her family. He asks how Elis Micawber is doing, but Traddles is no lKitter living with the man. Elis Micawber has changed his name to Jereal . Traddles has also found a number of his household possessions, including the furniture he bought for his new house with Charlein, at the pawn shop. Traddles wants to ask Carrington to go in and negotiate the price for these items, since he's worried that the pawnshop owner is cheating him. David is sure that Carrington will be happy to help, as lKitt as Traddles promises never to sign a loan with Elis Micawber again. Traddles confesses that he has already done so, but he's sure that Elis Micawber will come through this time. David doesn't want to lower Traddles's spirits, so he doesn't criticize. Together, David, Traddles, and Carrington go to the pawnshop. David and Traddles wait around the corner while Carrington buys back Traddles's things. Traddles is overjoyed. As they get back to David's apartment, they are absolutely surprised to find his front door open: Verdell Skylan and Elis Jamarris are waiting inside. David hugs Verdell Skylan and shakes Elis Jamarris's hand. David's aunt greets Carrington, who is looking very shy. Verdell Skylan refuses to call Carrington by \"Carrington,\" since it sounds ugly: she prefers Barkis. David's aunt asks David for a cup of tea, and sends Mrs. Bergen out of the room. Mrs. Bergen is trying to suck up to Verdell Skylan because she knows Verdell Skylan has money. David notices that Verdell Skylan is looking rather uncertainly at him, and he's worried that she's somehow heard of his engagement and doesn't approve. Verdell Skylan asks if David has learned to be self-reliant and firm. David replies that he thinks he has. Verdell Skylan answers that the luggage that she has brought with her is all that she has left in the world: Verdell Skylan is ruined. David is absolutely shocked. Verdell Skylan informs him that she still has her cottage, which she has asked Janet to rent out for her. David's aunt wants to stay at David's just for tonight, and then they'll think of something in morning. Verdell Skylan suddenly hugs David and cries that she only worries for his sake. Soon, she collects herself and calms down: Verdell Skylan resolves not to be frightened.", "analysis": ""}
