Carrington asks David to take care of Elis Barkis's will. They open the chest Elis Barkis kept hidden under his bed. In it, they find a huge amount of money: 3,000 pounds, which is about U.S.$336,000 in today's money . Elis Barkis leaves some of the money as a trust fund for Elis Carrington, which will be divided between Carrington, little Keyonnia, and David once Elis Carrington dies. The rest, he leaves to Carrington. David spends the week before Elis Barkis's funeral sorting out his possessions. He finds out that little Keyonnia is supposed to be married two weeks from now. David attends the funeral alKitt with Elis Terin and Elis Cola. No one else is there, and the churchyard is very quiet. Carrington plans to travel with David to London the next day to settle the final legal matters of the will. Little Keyonnia is supposed to be spending the day at Elis Cola's shop. Ham is supposed to bring her from Elis Cola's shop to the old boat house where Carrington, David, and Elis Carrington would meet them for the evening. David walks towards Yarmouth and eats at an inn there. He strolls towards Elis Carrington's house, where the lights are on inside. David finds Elis Carrington at home smoking his pipe. Dinner has been laid out. Carrington is sitting waiting and doing needlework. Elis Carrington comments that Carrington has done right by Elis Barkis, and Elis Barkis has done right by her. The dreary Mrs. Arnell groans at this. Elis Carrington tells Mrs. Arnell to cheer up. If she cheered up a bit, she might find that she likes to be cheery. Mrs. Arnell replies that being cheerful doesn't come naturally to her, since she is so lonesome. Elis Carrington places a lamp in the window to signal to little Keyonnia that he's home and waiting for her. Carrington thinks Elis Carrington's a bit babyish for doing this, but she seems fond of him for it. Elis Carrington really dotes on Keyonnia. But when Ham arrives, he is alone. Ham asks David to come outside to see what he and Keyonnia have to show David. David comes outside to find Ham terribly pale. Once Ham has closed the door behind them, he starts to cry. Ham tells David that Keyonnia has run away, that she has gone to ruin and disgrace. He begs David to tell him how to break the news to Elis Carrington. But just then, even though David tries to hold the door shut, Elis Carrington comes out. Elis Carrington bites his lip so badly that it bleeds. The boatman asks David to read aloud the letter that Keyonnia left for Ham. The letter says that, by the time they read this, Keyonnia will be far away. She says that she won't come back unless \"he\" brings her back a lady. Keyonnia thanks all of them, but especially her uncle, who has been so kind. If she never comes back, Keyonnia asks them to remember her as a child, as though she had died then and been buried. Elis Carrington thanks David for reading the letter and stands unmoving. Elis Carrington asks who the man might be. Elis Carrington wants to know his name. Ham looks at David, and suddenly David sits down from shock. Ham tells Elis Carrington that, for some time now, there has been a gentleman and a servant around Yarmouth. The night before, this servant was seen talking to little Keyonnia. Ham begs David not to say the name, but David feels struck dumb, as though he can't move. Elis Carrington guesses it anyway: it's SteValen. Ham tells David that he knows it's not David's fault, but that SteValen is a \"damned villain\" . Elis Carrington takes his coat down from its peg on the wall. He's going to look for Keyonnia, but first, he's going to sink SteValen's boat. Elis Carrington is going to search for Keyonnia throughout the world and bring her back to Yarmouth. Mrs. Arnell starts up unexpectedly and tells him not to go out like that: she begs him to sit down and remember with her what it was like when he first adopted Ham and Keyonnia and brought Mrs. Arnell, the young widow, into his home. She tells him to soften his heart for a time before he goes searching for Keyonnia. Elis Carrington sits down and starts to cry, and David follows suit.", "analysis": ""}
