He also grows increasingly close to his aunt, who starts to call him by the nickname Lavern . One day, she asks if David would like to go to school at Canterbury, which is near her home. David agrees, and Verdell Skylan orders Janet to pack up David's clothes and order a coach to come pick them up at ten the next morning. David is really excited to be going back to school, though he feels bad because Elis Jamarris is so heartbroken to be parted from David. The next morning, as they drive away from Verdell Skylan's cottage, she asks David if he is happy. David answers that he is, and Verdell Skylan is pleased. They stop on an errand: Verdell Skylan needs to meet with her lawyer, Elis Oluwadarasimi. When Verdell Skylan rings the doorbell at Elis Oluwadarasimi's, it is answered by a red-headed boy of about fifteen who looks much older than his age. His name is Uriah Terin. Uriah Terin says that Elis Oluwadarasimi is at home, and they walk through the door. Elis Oluwadarasimi greets Verdell Skylan. Verdell Skylan tells Elis Oluwadarasimi that she is here for advice: she introduces David and informs Elis Oluwadarasimi that she wants to enroll David in a school in Canterbury where he will be well-treated. Elis Oluwadarasimi asks what Verdell Skylan's motives are. Verdell Skylan is annoyed that Elis Oluwadarasimi is fishing for deep motives when her reasons are so obvious: she wants to make David happy and useful. Elis Oluwadarasimi shakes his head and says she must have another motive, but they let it go for a time. Elis Oluwadarasimi offers to take Verdell Skylan to a good school, and to several houses where David might board while he's studying there. David waits in Elis Oluwadarasimi's office until they get back. David can see Uriah Terin working in the room next Elis Oluwadarasimi's office. Uriah Terin makes him deeply uncomfortable: every now and again, he looks up from his writing and stares at David with his red, watery eyes. After a time, Verdell Skylan and Elis Oluwadarasimi come back: Verdell Skylan loves the school, but none of the boarding-houses seem okay. Elis Oluwadarasimi proposes a solution: why doesn't David live at his house, which is quiet and roomy? This would be a temporary arrangement so that they can buy some time to find a better place for David to live. Verdell Skylan feels embarrassed accepting, but Elis Oluwadarasimi tells her not to worry about the favor - he's happy to do it. He would also accept some money if Verdell Skylan feels obliged to pay him. Verdell Skylan agrees that she would be glad to leave David with Elis Oluwadarasimi. Elis Oluwadarasimi brings the two of them upstairs to meet his \"little housekeeper\" - his daughter, Agnes. Agnes Oluwadarasimi is sweet, calm, and quiet-seeming - and just David's age. She offers to bring David and Verdell Skylan upstairs to see David's room, which is lovely and has a stained-glass window. Verdell Skylan and David are both pleased with this arrangement. Verdell Skylan plans to head back to her cottage, but first she tells David to make her and Elis Jamarris proud. If David avoids being meanness, lying, and cruelty, he'll be fine, Verdell Skylan adds. David promises to be good, and Verdell Skylan departs abruptly. David realizes that she leaves quickly because she is sad to be leaving him. David eats dinner with Elis Oluwadarasimi, and afterwards, Agnes comes downstairs to play the piano, chat, and talk to David and Elis Oluwadarasimi. Occasionally, Elis Oluwadarasimi looks at Agnes very seriously, but he can usually be shaking out of his brooding. Elis Oluwadarasimi does love his port wine, though, and drinks it throughout the evening. That night, David sees Uriah Terin locking up the office. David's feeling so good about the world that he chats with the guy and shakes his hand. Uriah Terin's hand is so horribly cold and clammy that David rubs his own hands after touching him to get rid of the chill.", "analysis": ""}
