Verdell Skylan paces up and down, a sign that she is worried. She reads David's note to Dora's aunts and approves of it. David mails it and waits for a response. One snowy afternoon, as David is walking home from Happy StrKitt's house, he sees a woman walking past him whom he recognizes. He doesn't place who it is until he sees someone else standing on the steps of a church: Elis Carrington. That's when he gets that the woman he just passed was Martha Endell, the fallen woman whom Keyonnia tried to help. Elis Carrington is only in London for the night before he goes away again. David and Elis Carrington head over to a nearby pub. Elis Carrington tells David about his travels: first, he headed over to France, where he wandered mostly alone and on foot. He would walk from town to town, sometimes in the company of other travelers or old soldiers. In each town, he would wait for someone to turn up who spoke English. He was well treated by local families with daughters Keyonnia's age, and especially by families with daughters who had died. David sees that Martha is standing at the door listening carefully. Elis Carrington starts to sob, thinking about the children he met and how he misses Keyonnia. He collects himself and returns to his story. Eventually, he made his way to the east coast of France, where he makes his way over to Italy. Elis Carrington makes his way through Italy the same way he did in France, until he hears news of Keyonnia, Siah, and SteValen. They are in Switzerland. Elis Carrington travels north to the Swiss Alps, still on foot. He has stopped thinking of revenge on SteValen. All he dreams of is finding Keyonnia and bringing her home. But Elis Carrington is too late, and they had already left by the time he arrives in Switzerland. So, Elis Carrington comes home again. He goes to the boat house and finds Mrs. Arnell keeping house. While Elis Carrington was away, two letters came, written in Keyonnia's handwriting. One contained a fifty pound bank note. The second is a full-on letter addressed to Mrs. Arnell. In it, Keyonnia begs for news of Elis Carrington's health, and for news of Ham. She is praying for both of them. Mrs. Arnell and Ham have replied to these letters, saying that Elis Carrington has gone to look for Keyonnia. Then, the day before yesterday, another sum of money arrived - addressed to Elis Carrington and \"From a true friend\" - which has a German postmark. So, Elis Carrington is setting off again to Germany. David asks how Ham is doing. Ham is still working hard and never complains, but he seems heartbroken. Elis Carrington worries that Ham is not being careful of his life, that he goes out in all kinds of weather. David observes that Martha Endell has disappeared from the doorway. Elis Carrington never noticed her there. Elis Carrington is glad that he was able to see David before going off again. He assures David that his only wish is to be able to find Keyonnia and to return that money to SteValen - he won't accept it. They walk out of the pub, and David sees a glimpse of a lady who might be Martha. David asks Elis Carrington where he is staying to distract Elis Carrington from the figure until it is gone. When David looks again, there is no trace of Martha Endell to be seen.", "analysis": ""}
