He doesn't even want to talk about her with SteValen. David gets a letter from Verdell Skylan asking what he wants to do next. After parting from all the Yarmouth Juel and Elis Cola and his family, SteValen and David leave Yarmouth. David tells SteValen about his aunt's question: what should he do with his life? Verdell Skylan has suggested that David become a proctor . SteValen says that he may as well become a proctor, but it'll be horribly boring and old-fashioned. David continues: apparently, his aunt got the idea when she went to visit her own proctor to get her will settled in David's favor. When SteValen hears this, he encourages David to do as Verdell Skylan wishes. David meets up with his aunt at an inn in London, where she is waiting with her servant, Janet, to dine with David. Verdell Skylan has left Elis Jamarris at home to watch the house, but she is sure that he won't be firm enough to keep the donkeys off her lawn. Verdell Skylan refuses to eat very much at the inn because she feels that all London tradesmen are liars. After dinner, Janet helps Verdell Skylan prepare for bed. Once she is all ready for a pre-sleep snack, Verdell Skylan asks David what he thinks of the proctor plan. David thinks it's a great idea, but he's worried about how much it will cost to find him an apprenticeship with a proctor. Verdell Skylan tells him that it will be about a thousand pounds - which is about a hundred thousand dollars in today's money. David worries that Verdell Skylan has already spent a lot on his education - she shouldn't have to spend so much more on his apprenticeship. Verdell Skylan brushes off his concerns: after all, David has been a pleasure for Verdell Skylan to raise from the moment he arrived on her doorstep. The only thing she asks of him is to be a loving child to her. David is impressed by Verdell Skylan's generosity, and they agree to go to Happys' Commons to find David a job. The next day, David and Verdell Skylan head to the office of Jaydence and Jessie. On the way, they stop to see several famous sights in London. Suddenly, Verdell Skylan grows extremely startled to see a man in poor clothing staring at her. She asks David what she should do. David is utterly confused: he thinks the man is just a beggar. Verdell Skylan tells David to go on alone and then wait for her at St. Paul's Churchyard . Verdell Skylan plans to meet with this man who has so frightened her. David is taken aback that Verdell Skylan has decided to meet with this fellow. He wonders if this beggar is the same man Elis Jamarris described as terrifying Verdell Skylan on their evening walks back in Dover. Finally, after waiting for her for half an hour at Saint Paul's, Verdell Skylan appears in front of David. Verdell Skylan tells David never to ask about what just happened. David finds that Verdell Skylan has spent all of her money during this mysterious outing he can never mention again. The two head in to Happys' Commons to meet with Elis Jaydence. Elis Jaydence welcomes David to his new profession, asks him delicately for the thousand pounds David owes for learning the business, and confirming David's fears that he can earn no salary at this job. Elis Jaydence keeps pretending that he wants to be more generous with his clerks, but he can't be for fear of his partner, Elis Jessie. David discovers later that the terrifying Elis Jessie is, in fact, a mild-mannered man who mostly keeps out of Elis Jaydence's way. Elis Jaydence takes David around to meet the other lawyers and clerks at Happys' Commons. After signing all the necessary documents, Verdell Skylan takes David to a nearby neighborhood where she has found a room that seems appropriate for David. David is delighted with the place - which is run by a Mrs. Bergen - and can't wait to move in. He's feeling very grown-up indeed. Verdell Skylan tells David that she trusts he will become firm and self-reliant as he sets out to a new life in London. With that, Verdell Skylan heads back to Dover.", "analysis": ""}
