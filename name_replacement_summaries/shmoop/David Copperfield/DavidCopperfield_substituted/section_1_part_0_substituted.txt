{"name": "Chapter 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-2", "summary": "The first things David can remember from early childhood are his pretty mother, and Carrington, his mother's not-so-pretty housekeeper. He also remembers his house, which had a pigeon-house with no pigeons and a dog kennel with no dogs. David recalls a series of early sense impressions: of a graveyard covered with mossy grass and the church where he, Carrington, and his mother go on Sundays. He remembers sitting in the parlor with his mother. One night, as David waits up to see his mother when she comes home from an outing, David asks Carrington if she has ever been married. Carrington says no. David continues: but, if you marry someone and that person dies, then you're allowed to marry someone else? Carrington agrees that you can, if you want to. David thinks that Carrington is angry with him, but she doesn't seem to be. In fact, she hugs David tightly. He has no idea why Carrington seems so upset. Finally, David's mother comes home. With her is a man with dark hair and a mustache, who speaks in a deep voice that David doesn't trust. The man insists that David shake his hand, but David really doesn't want to: there's something about this guy that he doesn't like. The man leaves, and David, Mrs. Arleigh, and Carrington all head in to the parlor. Carrington asks Mrs. Arleigh if she's had a nice evening; Mrs. Arleigh agrees that she has. David dozes off, and when he wakes up, Carrington and Mrs. Arleigh are having a bit of an argument. Carrington says that Elis Arleigh wouldn't like \"such a one as this\" - presumably the black-haired man. Mrs. Arleigh asks how Carrington dares to say such unpleasant things to Mrs. Arleigh, when Carrington knows that Mrs. Arleigh is entirely alone in the world. Mrs. Arleigh thinks Carrington is suggesting that she doesn't love David enough, and turns to David to ask him if she's a bad mother. Mrs. Arleigh, Carrington, and David all burst out crying. After this, David remembers seeing the dark-haired man more and more, and Carrington less and less. David continues to feel resentful and jealous of the dark-haired man. He's not sure why. He's too young to put all the pieces together about what the dark-haired man is doing hanging around his mother all the time. We find out that this dark-haired man is named Elis Daine. One day, Elis Daine comes galloping up and offers to take David for a ride. He takes David down the coast to a hotel, where they meet with two other men, Tam and Passnidge. Daine and Tam talk right over David's head about Daine's plans to marry David's mother. David doesn't understand that Daine and Tam are talking about him whenever they refer to \"Brooks of Sheffield.\" He spends the afternoon not realizing that he's the butt of their jokes about the pretty little widow. David observes that Elis Daine seems much more serious than his two friends, who both seem a bit afraid of Elis Daine. Elis Daine basically never laughs. Once David gets home, he tells his mother all about the nice things that Elis Daine, Tam, and Passnidge said about Mrs. Arleigh's appearance. She's terribly pleased and flattered. She doesn't want David to tell Carrington, in case it will make her angry. The next day, Carrington asks David if he wants to come to visit Carrington's brother at Yarmouth . David's pretty excited at the idea of meeting Carrington's family and seeing the ocean and fishermen and so on, but he's worried about what his mother will do in his absence. Carrington says it's fine; Mrs. Arleigh's staying with a neighbor, Mrs. Grayper, for two weeks. As they head out to the cart that will carry them away, Mrs. Arleigh kisses David again and again - she and David have never been parted before. David and Carrington climb into the cart. Over his shoulder, David turns to see Elis Daine standing next to Mrs. Arleigh. Elis Daine seems to be scolding Mrs. Arleigh for being so emotional. Carrington observes this scene as well. She looks very unhappy.", "analysis": ""}
