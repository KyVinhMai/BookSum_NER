Before bedtime one night, Tungay fetches David and takes him to Elis Creakle's part of the building. Elis Creakle is waiting with Mrs. Creakle, his wife, and Verdell Creakle, his daughter. Elis Creakle's face is red and horribly angry-looking, but he speaks in a tiny whisper that makes him all the more intimidating. Elis Creakle tells David that he knows David's stepfather, Elis Daine. He also tells David that he is \"a Tartar\" - a violent person - who gets things done. When his own flesh and blood offends him, he'll get rid of it. Elis Creakle asks Tungay if \"that fellow\" has been around Salem House? Tungay says no. Finally, Elis Creakle says that David can go. David asks Elis Creakle if he can take off the sign before the boys come back. Elis Creakle leaps out of his chair, frightening David so much that he runs straight back to his bed. The following day, another teacher comes back: Elis Sharp, who is Elis Oluwadarasimi's superior. Elis Sharp is delicate and wears a wig. The first boy to come back is Jomarionmy Traddles, which is lucky for David, because Traddles doesn't take the sign too seriously, mostly just treating it like a game. This is a little embarrassing for David, but nothing like the social death he expected. Next up is James SteValen, a good-looking older boy, who tells David that his sign is \"a jolly shame\" , which makes David adore him. SteValen asks David if he has any money, which he does - 7 shillings from Carrington's purse. The older boy encourages David to spend some of that money on treats for the other boys in their dorm room, which SteValen then distributes as though he were their host. But David doesn't mind this - he's a bit in awe of SteValen. The boys all start talking about the masters at Salem House: Elis Creakle is, indeed, supposed to be a violent jerk who will happily beat the boys if he wants to. The wooden-legged man, Tungay, works for Elis Creakle because he has been in his employment for a lKitt time, mostly doing dirty work. Tungay hates everyone at Salem House, except Elis Creakle, and enjoys making all of their lives miserable. Apparently, Elis Creakle has a son who used to teach at the school, but Elis Creakle tossed the boy out of his home when the kid protested at the way that Elis Creakle treats Mrs. Creakle. There is one boy who Elis Creakle never beats: James SteValen. SteValen is the only \"parlor-boarder\" - the only of the boys who gets to eat with Elis Creakle - and he seems to have some sort of weird authority over both the teachers and the students alike. The boys all gossip about how poor Elis Oluwadarasimi is and about Elis Sharp's badly fitting wig. They also talk about Verdell Creakle, who is supposed to have a crush on SteValen. David thinks of the breakfast he had with Elis Oluwadarasimi's mother, but doesn't say anything about it. When the boys all go to bed, SteValen tells David good night, and that he'll take care of David. David thanks him. SteValen asks if David has a sister, because if David does, SteValen would guess that she would be a pretty, shy, bright girl. David says no, he doesn't, and SteValen thinks it's a shame.", "analysis": ""}
