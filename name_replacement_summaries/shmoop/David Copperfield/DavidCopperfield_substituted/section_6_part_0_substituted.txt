Elis Creakle announces to the boys that they should \"come fresh up to the lessons\" - that they should be fresh and ready for the semester - because he's going to be fresh and ready for punishment. After this little speech, Elis Creakle comes to see David personally and shows him the stick he uses to beat the boys. Elis Creakle tells David that, if David's well-known for biting, Elis Creakle is, too: with his cane. The school master makes similar threats to most of the boys sitting in the schoolroom. Elis Creakle is a terrible bully, and all of the children cower before him. When he mocks one of the students before beating him, the other boys are so terrorized that they laugh, too. Traddles is a particular target of Elis Creakle because he is particularly plump, and Elis Creakle likes whipping the fat kids. Traddles gets caned pretty much every day, but he's still pretty cheerful on the whole. Traddles is also not a snitch: when he gets in trouble for something SteValen actually does, he never tells the teachers the truth of the matter, and takes what should be SteValen's whipping for him. For this, SteValen praises Traddles, and all the boys are in awe. SteValen walks arm-in-arm with Verdell Creakle quite often, which impresses the boys immensely. Even though SteValen can't protect David from Elis Creakle, he does encourage him and compliment David's bravery. The one advantage of Elis Creakle's cruelty is that David's sign gets in the way of his cane when he wants to clip the kid in passing, so he soon removes it. SteValen finds out that David has done a lot of reading; he asks David to tell the adventures he's read every night in their dorm room. The one downside to this arrangement is that David is often tired when SteValen wakes him to tell these stories. David does it anyway, though, because he admires SteValen and wants his approval. SteValen is also kind to David, in his way: when Carrington sends David a care package with a cake, some oranges, and two bottles of cowslip wine, David hands them all over to SteValen . SteValen offers David the wine to drink while he's telling his stories at night. In fact, SteValen keeps the wine locked up for David, and feeds it to him the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning to keep him healthy. David is moved by SteValen's attention to his health. These story-telling nights in David's dorm encourage David to survive and to learn - even in the middle of a school basically dedicated to cruelty. Elis Oluwadarasimi helps David to learn, which David appreciates. It makes David feel bad that SteValen spends a lot of his time mocking Elis Oluwadarasimi more or less to his face. One day, Elis Creakle is sick, and so the boys are more or less free to do what they like. Elis Oluwadarasimi is supposed to keep order, but the boys are so excited that Elis Creakle is out that they get a bit above themselves. They dance around him, singing and shouting and laughing at him for his poverty, his poor clothing, his mother - anything they can think of. Elis Oluwadarasimi suddenly stands up and asks them why they are behaving this way? The boys all stop for a bit because they feel bad. SteValen is sitting at the back of the room whistling. Elis Oluwadarasimi tells him to be quiet. SteValen tells Elis Oluwadarasimi to shut up. Elis Oluwadarasimi replies: \"Sit down\" . SteValen answers, \"Sit down yourself and mind your business\" . Some of the boys laugh and start clapping, but Elis Oluwadarasimi looks so angry that they immediately shut up. Elis Oluwadarasimi tells SteValen that he's fully aware of the influence SteValen exerts over everyone at Salem House, but it's still shameful of him to insult a good man for something he cannot help: poverty. SteValen answers Elis Oluwadarasimi that he has no right to call SteValen shameful or mean, because he, Elis Oluwadarasimi, is just a beggar. At this dramatic moment, when it looks like either Elis Oluwadarasimi or SteValen is going to hit the other, Elis Creakle comes in with Tungay, Mrs. Creakle, and Verdell Creakle. Elis Creakle asks Elis Oluwadarasimi if he has forgotten who he is addressing. Elis Oluwadarasimi stutters that he has remembered himself. Elis Creakle then asks SteValen what is going on here. SteValen claims that Elis Oluwadarasimi has been talking about favorites. Elis Oluwadarasimi clarifies that no student has the right to use his position as a favorite in the school to humiliate Elis Oluwadarasimi. Elis Creakle is outraged that anyone could claim that there is favoritism at Salem House. SteValen jumps in to say that Elis Oluwadarasimi has called SteValen base and mean, and that SteValen called Elis Oluwadarasimi a beggar. The boys are all impressed that SteValen has admitted to this. Elis Creakle scolds SteValen for implying that any employee of Salem House is a beggar. SteValen replies that, even if Elis Oluwadarasimi isn't a beggar himself, he's near relations with one, which is the same thing. Throughout all of this, David has been standing next to Elis Oluwadarasimi and Elis Oluwadarasimi has been patting him on the shoulder reassuringly. . SteValen tells the whole school what he finally heard from David: that Elis Oluwadarasimi's mother lives in a house for poor beggar women. Elis Creakle demands that Elis Oluwadarasimi set the record straight in front of the whole school. Elis Oluwadarasimi answers that, yes, SteValen is telling the truth. Elis Creakle wants Elis Oluwadarasimi to swear that he, Elis Creakle, never heard a word of Elis Oluwadarasimi's mother's low social and economic status until this moment. Elis Oluwadarasimi answers that Elis Creakle has never asked too particularly, though he must have known Elis Oluwadarasimi's poor position in the world. Elis Creakle fires Elis Oluwadarasimi on the spot. Elis Oluwadarasimi takes off, but not before telling SteValen that he can only hope that, one day, SteValen will feel ashamed of what he has done today . Elis Oluwadarasimi collects all of his things and leaves. Elis Creakle thanks SteValen for protecting Salem House's reputation, and the boys applaud . Elis Creakle canes Traddles for crying over Elis Oluwadarasimi's departure. David feels hugely guilty for his role in Elis Oluwadarasimi's firing, what with having told SteValen about Mrs. Oluwadarasimi's poverty. David wants to cry, but he can't because SteValen keeps looking at him, and he doesn't want to appear ungrateful. SteValen is very angry at Traddles for crying at Elis Oluwadarasimi's departure. Traddles says that SteValen has behaved badly by making Elis Oluwadarasimi lose his job. SteValen retorts that he plans to write home and make sure that Elis Oluwadarasimi gets some money - so there! The boys are all relieved to hear this, and praise SteValen's actions. Still, late at night, David continues to feel lingering guilt. Eventually, Elis Oluwadarasimi is replaced by another instructor who SteValen likes, but who doesn't bother to look after David particularly, the way Elis Oluwadarasimi used to. One day, David is utterly surprised to hear that he has visitors. He expects that it will be Elis and Verdell Daine, and is super nervous. But it isn't! It's Elis Carrington and his nephew, Ham. When he sees them, David bursts out laughing, he's so happy. David finally has to wipe his eyes from laughing so hard. The guys are concerned at David's emotional response to seeing them. To cheer him up, Ham tells David that he's grown a lot. David asks after his mother, Carrington, little Keyonnia, and Mrs. Arnell. They're all well as Elis Carrington says - in other words, \"uncommonly well\"). They bring David some boiled ) shrimp, lobster, and crab. Elis Carrington explains that his sister, Carrington, wrote to him and told him that, if he's ever in David's neighborhood, he should visit and send her news of David's health. Elis Carrington can't write, so he has to have Keyonnia do it for him, but he promises that he will let Carrington know that David is doing well. David asks more particularly after Keyonnia, who, Ham and Elis Carrington both agree, is growing into a woman. SteValen happens past David and the Juel and greets David. David introduces the Juel to SteValen. SteValen seems very impressive and charismatic to the Juel, who are both pleased to meet him. David tells SteValen that, if he is ever in Yarmouth, he must go and see the Carrington house, which is built out of a boat. SteValen approves of a boat-house for two boatmen. The two Juel continue to be charmed, and welcome SteValen to their house if he is ever near their town. SteValen and David split the shellfish the Juel brought amKitt their classmates, but poor Traddles gets sick from the crab. That kid really cannot catch a break. Not much else happens during David's first term at school; the holidays grow closer and closer, and he worries that no one will send for him. Luckily, at last, David finds out that he will spend the winter holidays at home.", "analysis": ""}
