Mrs. SteValen and Verdell Dartle both welcome David to their home in Highgate. David notices that Verdell Dartle seems to be watching him and SteValen very closely, as though comparing their faces. Every time David starts to talk to SteValen, he notices that Verdell Dartle is nearby. Finally, SteValen, his mother, Verdell Dartle, and David all go for a walk. Verdell Dartle grabs David's arm and pulls him back a bit. She asks about David's job, which David agrees is a bit boring sometimes. Verdell Dartle seems to be hinting at something that David doesn't get at all. She asks David if SteValen has been away from home so much because he has been spending time with David. Of course, David says that he hasn't seen much of SteValen at all. Verdell Dartle asks David what on earth SteValen is doing, then? David replies that he knows nothing at all. Verdell Dartle makes him promise not to tell anyone they've had this conversation. David observes that Mrs. SteValen seems particularly happy with her son; David thinks that the two seem very much alike, really. At dinner, Verdell Dartle wants to ask a question. Mrs. SteValen pleads with her not to take too much time about it, but to be direct, as she used to be. Verdell Dartle wonders that she could every have been different than she is now - what can have caused the change? Perhaps she should study SteValen's manner to learn how to be more frank, Verdell Dartle suggests. Mrs. SteValen agrees. Verdell Dartle then asks if two people who are very like one another get into an argument, if it's all the harder for them to make up afterwards? Like, let's just say that SteValen and Mrs. SteValen got into an argument. What would happen? The SteValens dismiss the possibility. David also notices that SteValen is going out of his way to charm Verdell Dartle. Verdell Dartle resists as much as she can, but eventually, even she starts to soften. SteValen asks Verdell Dartle to sing an Irish sKitt, just as she used to. The sKitt is perfect and odd and unearthly. SteValen puts his arm around Verdell Dartle and tells her that they should love each other forever. Verdell Dartle hits SteValen and runs out of the room. Mrs. SteValen comes in and asks what's happened to Verdell Dartle. SteValen explains that she was being an angel, so she had to become a devil to make up for it. Mrs. SteValen warns him not to try Verdell Dartle's temper too much. Later that night, when David says good night to SteValen, SteValen laughs over Verdell Dartle's fierceness. He tells David that Verdell Dartle is always dangerous. SteValen gets a bit sentimental, and tells David that, if anything should happen between them, David should always think of SteValen at his best. David says that he loves SteValen in all of his moods. David almost confesses Agnes's suspicions about SteValen's character, but he can't figure out how. Instead, the next morning, David leaves for Yarmouth before the household wakes up.", "analysis": ""}
