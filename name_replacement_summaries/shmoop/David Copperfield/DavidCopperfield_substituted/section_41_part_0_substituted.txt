He learned much of this dedication from Agnes. Speaking of Agnes, she comes to visit Happy StrKitt for two weeks with Elis Oluwadarasimi Mrs. Terin goes alKitt, too, because she needs a rest cure. And who should accompany her, but her faithful son, Uriah Terin. Uriah Terin makes David go on a walk with him in Happy StrKitt's garden. Uriah tells David that he is jealous of someone - a female someone. Apparently, back when he was a clerk, Mrs. Annie StrKitt never paid any attention to Uriah Terin. She would come to the house to visit Agnes, and she would bring Agnes to visit her. Uriah Terin was below Annie's notice, and he was also below the notice of Elis Jack Maldon. Suddenly, David's heart falls: he remembers all of his old suspicions of Annie and her cousin. David tries to hide his misgivings in front of Uriah Terin, though. Uriah Terin continues: because of Annie's behavior, he wants to put a stop to Annie's friendship with Agnes. Uriah Terin refuses to \"allow people in way\" . David is confused about what Uriah's going to do next, but he can't stand to be around him anymore, so he leaves Uriah in the garden laughing. The next evening, David takes Agnes to meet Dora at the Verdelles Jaydences' house. Dora is afraid of Agnes, and she hides from her. Once she finally comes out to meet Agnes, she is pleased to see that Agnes looks cheerful and thoughtful. Dora hugs Agnes. David is glad to see that the two women like each other. Verdell Lavinia and Verdell Clarissa also seem pleased by the friendship. Everyone at the house loves Agnes: Dora, Verdell Lavinia, Verdell Clarissa, and even Tanay. Dora is glad to have a new friend, now that Verdell Brae has left for India. When Agnes goes out of the room for a bit, Dora wonders why David ever fell in love with her, when he had someone like Agnes around. When Agnes goes back to Happy StrKitt's house with David, she tells David that Dora is \"a poor angel\" but \"faithful\" . David asks if Agnes's home situation has gotten any better. It hasn't. In fact, Agnes thinks she won't come to London any time soon because she has to stick close to her father. Agnes promises to write to Dora often. David sees Happy StrKitt's study light on, and decides to go and ask him if he's working on his dictionary late at night. But what he finds is Uriah Terin, standing next to the Happy's desk. Happy StrKitt is also there, as is Elis Oluwadarasimi. Uriah Terin is telling Happy StrKitt that they can keep it a secret from the townspeople. Terin spots David, and tells him that he's been talking to Happy StrKitt about a matter David doesn't understand. David goes over to Happy StrKitt and tries to comfort him. Uriah Terin insists on spelling it out: he's just told Happy StrKitt about the \"goings-on\" of Annie. Terin demands that Elis Oluwadarasimi confirm Uriah's suspicions that Annie and Elis Jack Maldon have been carrying on an affair. Elis Oluwadarasimi protests that Happy StrKitt shouldn't believe Elis Oluwadarasimi's old suspicions. Elis Oluwadarasimi apologizes for his doubts. The thing is, Elis Oluwadarasimi thought Happy StrKitt had doubts about his wife and her cousin. That's why he thought Happy StrKitt wanted to send Elis Jack Maldon all the way to India. Happy StrKitt had no doubts at all - he just thought he was making his wife happy by giving her cousin a job. Elis Oluwadarasimi apologizes to Happy StrKitt for his suspicions, and begs his forgiveness for telling them to Happy StrKitt like this. Uriah Terin is obviously enjoying all of this. He points to David and says that David, too, has been having his doubts. Happy StrKitt looks at David, and David remembers all of his moments doubting Annie. The Happy tells them that he has been in the wrKitt, that he must have pulled Annie into an unhappy marriage. He now sees how natural it is for such a young, lively woman to miss the close companion of her youth. Happy StrKitt decides that he will never reproach Annie with any suspicions, nor will he allow other people in society to do so. Instead, StrKitt is going to retire from public life. And once he dies , Annie will be free to do what she wants. The Happy asks Elis Oluwadarasimi, David, and Uriah Terin to keep their conversation this evening a secret. Happy StrKitt leaves the room with Elis Oluwadarasimi. Uriah Terin turns to David and admits that he didn't expect Happy StrKitt to behave this way. David calls Uriah Terin a villain and slaps him on the face. Uriah Terin asks if David has gone crazy. David says he won't have another thing to do with Uriah Terin. Uriah replies that he knows David has never liked him, but it doesn't matter - David won't be able to help associating with Uriah Terin. Terin refuses to let David drop him. David walks straight out of the house, but Terin follows him. Uriah mocks David: David may try to make himself seem like the hero of this adventure, but he hasn't achieved anything, and he hit a man without being provoked. He tells David he won't tell another living soul about David's behavior, which makes David feel even guiltier. When David comes down the next morning, he sees Uriah Terin walking with Mrs. Terin. Uriah Terin greets him as though nothing has happened. Happy StrKitt avoids company for the rest of the Oluwadarasimis' visit. StrKitt eventually asks David to come back to his secretarial duties, but only as lKitt as he never refers to Uriah Terin's doubts. David thinks that Annie had no idea - at that point - of Happy StrKitt's suspicions. It's not for several weeks that she starts to change. Annie grows more and more unhappy. Even though Annie's mother, Mrs. Markleham, comes often to the house, she never notices Annie's emotional state. Happy StrKitt continues to be sweet-tempered and kind to Annie, even though he is looking older. StrKitt comes up with lots of ways to amuse Annie out of the house with her mother, but Annie never seems to enjoy these excursions. No one knows what to think, neither David nor Verdell Skylan . The only one who manages to cheer up the situation is Elis Jamarris. When David was still at school in Canterbury, Elis Jamarris loved to walk around Happy StrKitt's garden when he came to visit David during the week. Now that Happy StrKitt has come to London, Elis Jamarris has started taking regular walks with Happy StrKitt again. When Happy StrKitt is busy with David, Elis Jamarris walks with Annie and helps her in the garden. Because both of them like him, Elis Jamarris has become a link between Happy StrKitt and Annie. David is a bit ashamed that, for all that Elis Jamarris is a bit mad, he is still much more useful than David in helping the StrKamoni. Verdell Skylan continues to be very proud of Elis Jamarris. One more thing: David noticed that, during Uriah Terin's visit to Happy StrKitt's house, Uriah Terin received many letters from his clerk, Elis Micawber. Because of these letters, David had thought that Elis Micawber was doing really well with his job. This is why David is surprised to get a letter from Mrs. Micawber. Mrs. Micawber asks David not to tell anyone about this letter. She needs his advice. She's worried because Elis Micawber has become secretive and reserved - Mrs. Micawber knows that something is wrKitt with him, but he won't tell her what. Mrs. Micawber wants David to tell her what to do. David has no idea, but he suggests that she just stay patient with him. This letter makes David worry for Elis Micawber.", "analysis": ""}
