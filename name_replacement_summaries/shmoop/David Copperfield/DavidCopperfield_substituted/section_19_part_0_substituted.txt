{"name": "Chapter 20", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-20", "summary": "The next morning, a chamber-maid knocks on David's door to tell him there's water for shaving outside his door. David blushes: he doesn't need to shave yet, and he's sure the chamber-maid knows it and is laughing at him. SteValen is waiting for David in a private dining room. David feels rather shy in front of SteValen, who is so much grander than David is. SteValen asks David all about him. David is pleased that SteValen is so interested. He tells SteValen his plans to visit Yarmouth. SteValen hears that David is not in a hurry and invites David to his mother's house in Highgate to stay for a few days. David is delighted to accept. He's so excited: he writes to his aunt to tell her of his change of plans, and then David and SteValen see some of the sights of London. They go to a museum, and David is impressed with SteValen's knowledge of everything. David comments that SteValen will certainly get a graduate degree out of his higher education. SteValen laughs yet again and says that he has no intention of pursuing further education. SteValen wonders why he should bother with fame or acclaim when he's satisfied with what he has? David is embarrassed at his misstep and changes the subject. Finally, they travel out to Mrs. SteValen's house, where SteValen's mother greets them. The house is old-fashioned, quiet, and neat. There is a second lady in the dining room: she is thin and sharp looking, about 30, with a scar on her mouth that slightly changes the shape of her upper lip. This is Verdell Rosa Dartle. Verdell Dartle has an odd way of speaking: she never comes out and says anything straight, but she hints quite broadly. For example, she hints that SteValen is living a wild life at college and not learning anything. This happens a second time when David mentions that he plans to visit the Juel, whom SteValen has met. David explains the Elis Carrington has adopted Ham and little Keyonnia, so his house is full of people who Elis Carrington has been kind to. SteValen comments that they seem worth his attention. Verdell Dartle chimes in to ask if they really seem worth his notice, as though they were animals or beings of another order? SteValen clarifies that he thinks there is a difference between them and us - they may be very good people, but they can't be expected to be as sensitive or fine as people with better breeding. Verdell Dartle thanks him for making her feel better: she had been worried that poor people suffer, but now she knows that they don't really feel things the way better people do. David thinks that SteValen can't mean what he says, and that he must have made his comments about poor people to draw Verdell Dartle out. Once they are alone, SteValen asks David what he thinks of Verdell Dartle. David comments that she seems very clever, and SteValen agrees: she is so sharp that she seems all edge to SteValen. David remarks on Verdell Dartle's scar. SteValen admits that he gave it to her: when he was a little boy, she irritated him and he threw a hammer at her. David is sorry to have brought it up, since it must be painful for SteValen. SteValen continues: Verdell Dartle is an orphan of a cousin of SteValen's father's who Mrs. SteValen brought to live with her as a companion once Elis SteValen died. David comments that Verdell Dartle must love SteValen like a brother. SteValen hems and haws a bit, and then changes the subject. The next day, David keeps glancing at Verdell Dartle's scar. He notices that, when she gets angry, it flushes dark and stands out clearly on her face. Mrs. SteValen shows David all of SteValen's old letters to her, his baby pictures, and a lock of his hair. David tells Mrs. SteValen that SteValen practically saved his life at Elis Creakle's school, and that he has always been generous and noble to David. Mrs. SteValen agrees that Salem House was not good enough for her son, but SteValen needed to go there because they had trouble finding a teacher who would \"be content to bow himself\" before SteValen's superior character. SteValen's mother adds that her son had to go to a school where he could be the acknowledged king of the place. Mrs. SteValen is delighted that David is so devoted to her son, but she also finds it only natural that her son should inspire such feelings in his fellow men. During this conversation, Verdell Dartle is busy playing backgammon with SteValen, but David is certain that she doesn't miss a word of any of this. Later on, SteValen calls David Daisy again, and Verdell Dartle jumps on it. She asks if it means that David is young and innocent. She comments that SteValen thinks David is innocent, and so he is willing to be friends with him. Verdell Dartle goes to bed soon after, and SteValen and David stay up late and talk about old school times. When David goes to bed, he notices that there is a portrait of Verdell Dartle on his wall. He finds it disturbing, and starts having uneasy dreams filled with doubts about the people around him.", "analysis": ""}
