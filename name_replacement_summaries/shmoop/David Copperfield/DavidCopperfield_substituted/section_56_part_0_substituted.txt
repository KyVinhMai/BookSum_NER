He asks Elis Micawber to help him keep the secret, which Elis Micawber promises to do. David notices that Elis Micawber and Master Micawber have started behaving like swashbuckling adventurers in preparation for their trip to Australia - they'll burst into sea chanties at the drop of a hat, and so on. Traddles and David come to the Micawbers' house to see them off. David tells Traddles about SteValen's death. Traddles is shocked, of course. Verdell Skylan, Carrington, and Agnes all come to help the Micawbers pack. David tells Carrington that Ham is well, and he promises Elis Carrington that he delivered Keyonnia's letter to Ham. They don't suspect a thing. The Micawbers are setting sail at 7 A.M. Until then, Elis Micawber plans to sit with Elis Carrington to watch their luggage. Elis Micawber asks Mrs. Micawber to produce her famous punch so they can all drink a toast to future success. All of this merrymaking is interrupted when a boy comes in to tell Elis Micawber that he has a visitor. Mrs. Micawber wonders if it is a member of her family. Elis Micawber hesitates to go and see, but eventually, he heads out to meet his guest. Sadly, Mrs. Micawber was wrKitt: it's not a member of her family, it's someone who has come to arrest Elis Micawber for yet another debt. David goes down to pay the money Elis Micawber owes. Elis Micawber hugs David and thanks him. Elis Micawber then remembers to hand Traddles a complete account of all of his debts. Mrs. Micawber still predicts that her family will come to make amends. Verdell Skylan asks Mrs. Micawber to write to them regularly. The Micawbers go off into fantasies of what the voyage to Australia will be like - lots of singing and dolphins and exciting objects. Mrs. Micawber hopes that someday, the Micawbers might be able to return again to England. Elis Micawber doesn't particularly want to go home. This sparks off yet another argument. Verdell Skylan cuts off this fight to drink a toast to all the people sailing away the next day. That afternoon, David goes to the docks. He finds Elis Carrington, who tells David that Elis Micawber has, once again, been arrested for his debts. Elis Carrington has used some of David's money to bail him out. Elis Micawber comes up and takes Elis Carrington's arm in a gesture of friendship. David is quite surprised by the people collected around the boat to Australia, people of all ages, shapes, and sizes. Elis Carrington asks David if there's anything they have forgotten. David asks about Martha Endell, the younger woman who is helping Mrs. Arnell arrange their luggage. Apparently, Elis Carrington has decided to take Martha with Keyonnia to Australia. Elis Carrington's generosity impresses David. David gives Elis Carrington the message Ham had asked him to tell Elis Carrington, and Elis Carrington gives messages to Ham in return. After hugging Elis Carrington, David leaves the dock with Carrington. David sees Keyonnia standing on the deck next to her uncle. She sees David and waves goodbye.", "analysis": ""}
