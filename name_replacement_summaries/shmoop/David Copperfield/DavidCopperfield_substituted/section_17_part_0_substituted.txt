David is not the least successful boy in school, but he's still a lKitt way off from being the first one . Adams is not as superior as SteValen, but David still wonders what he'll be when he leaves the school - he's sure that Adam will be amazing. David has a crush on Verdell Landry, who boards at a school run by the Verdelles Nettingalls. The Verdelles Nettingalls' pupils go to the same church that Happy StrKitt's students attend. Luckily, David and Verdell Landry also go to the same dancing school. David gives Verdell Landry little presents: brazil nuts, cookies, and oranges. Slowly, however, they grow apart: David hears that Verdell Landry wishes David didn't stare at her so much. Worse still, Verdell Landry has a crush on Janyus, one of his schoolfellows. One day, David happens to walk past the Verdelles Nettingalls' girls and sees Verdell Landry making a face at him and then laughing to her friends. He's done with her. David grows older, and decides that he's above the Verdelles Nettingalls' young ladies. He's too good for them and for dancing school. Happy StrKitt calls David a promising scholar, and Elis Jamarris and Verdell Skylan are both very proud of him. A young butcher in the town threatens to beat up Happy StrKitt's boys because they think they're so great. In fact, he stops a couple of the younger boys and punches them. This butcher challenges David directly, and so David decides to fight him. The butcher totally kicks David's butt, and he has to stay home for a couple of days to recover. Agnes nurses David. She agrees that David had no choice but to fight the butcher . Adams graduates from the school and goes on to become a lawyer. David no lKitter thinks Adams is so very great: he suddenly seems very meek and not at all grand. Now David is head boy! He feels about a million miles away from the little boy he was when he first arrived at Happy StrKitt's school. And Agnes has also grown up: she is like a calm, sweet sister to David. David has fallen in love yet again, this time, with the eldest Verdell Larkins. Verdell Larkins is a tall woman of about thirty, and David is head over heels for her. David plans to go to a ball that he knows Verdell Larkins will also attend. When he can't be with Verdell Larkins, he tries to catch the eye of her father, Elis Larkin. David worries that, at 17, he may be too young for Verdell Larkins. But so what! He'll be 21 soon! Fantasies run through David's head of Verdell Skylan giving him her blessing to marry Verdell Larkins and offering him a fortune of 20,000 pounds. Sadly, in real life, he also notices that Verdell Larkins is very popular with the army officers in the town: he starts to worry that she won't even notice him. So, David finally makes it to the ball and asks Verdell Larkins to dance. David tells Verdell Larkins that he doesn't want to dance with anyone else. They do dance together, and David is pleased that he has snatched Verdell Larkins from the arms of Captain Bailey. David asks Verdell Larkins for a flower, which he then kisses and pins to his chest. Verdell Larkins tells David that he is very bold, and then asks to be escorted back to Captain Bailey. Verdell Larkins later approaches David with a plain, somewhat older gentleman on her arm. She introduces David to Elis Donyell, who is in the hops trade . David thinks that Elis Donyell must be some friend of the family, and is very proud of the introduction. He's absolutely thrilled at this attention from Verdell Larkins. That is, until several weeks later, when Agnes tells him at dinner that Verdell Larkins has just gotten married. To Captain Bailey? Nope, to Elis Donyell. David is miserable, stops wearing his best clothes, and throws away Verdell Larkins' flower. Tired of the whole dating scene, David challenges the butcher to another fight and beats him. He feels a bit better. And that's David's rise to the age of 17!", "analysis": ""}
