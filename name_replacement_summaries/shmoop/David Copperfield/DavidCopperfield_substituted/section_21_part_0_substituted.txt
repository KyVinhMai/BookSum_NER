They mostly stay together, but David hates sailing and SteValen loves it. So, SteValen frequently goes out at night with the fisherman while David stays over with Carrington and Elis Barkis. David also goes on lKitt walks by himself to see the old places of his childhood. So, there are several days when David goes off and SteValen entertains himself - but David doesn't know how. The Kitt has totally changed: the old rooks' nests have been removed, and the house has been refitted for a mentally ill man and his caretakers. Elis Terin has gotten married again and has a baby. David's old neighbors the Graypers have moved to South America. David feels fortunate to have such excellent friends as SteValen, Carrington, and his generous aunt. One evening, David comes home later than usual and finds SteValen sitting thoughtfully by the fire in Elis Carrington's house. When David startles SteValen when he puts his hand on SteValen's shoulder. SteValen is angry that David frightened him. He reproaches David for being late. He seems to be in a terrible mood. SteValen wishes that he had a better soul to guide his behavior. David has no idea what SteValen is talking about and is amazed at how unlike himself SteValen seems. SteValen shakes off his bad mood pretty quickly, but he does say that it would have been good for him to have a steady father figure. It's time for dinner, and neither David nor SteValen knows where anybody is. Just then, Mrs. Arnell comes in from the market, and explains that Elis Carrington is coming in with the changing tide. David and SteValen walk off in the direction of SteValen's hotel. SteValen seems quite cheered up, and wishes they didn't have to leave Yarmouth the next day - he likes this seafaring life. David compliments SteValen: Elis Carrington has told David that SteValen is a wonderful sailor. SteValen replies that he is never contented, except that he still takes pleasure in David's fresh manners. SteValen tells David that he has bought a boat at Yarmouth. David asks when SteValen will ever have the chance to come back here. SteValen answers that he has taken a liking to the place. David thinks that SteValen has bought the boat to do Elis Carrington a kindness, because Elis Carrington can use it while SteValen is away. SteValen blushes and says he doesn't want to talk about it. He tells David that Siah, his servant, has come down to Yarmouth and will arrange for the boat to be properly outfitted after SteValen leaves. Siah has come down from London with a letter from Mrs. SteValen. SteValen goes a little pale at the mention of his mother. David wonders if they have had a fight. David's friend plans to call his new boat the \"Little Em'ly.\" SteValen notices that Ham and Keyonnia are walking towards them. David looks at the couple and thinks how well-matched they are: yes, Ham looks a bit rough, but he has become a skilled workman and he looks rugged, honest, and so proud of Keyonnia. Keyonnia looks timid and shy, and won't walk arm in arm with Ham once she has seen David and SteValen. Just then, a strange woman walks past David and SteValen and follows Ham and Keyonnia. They have no clue who she could be, but this woman seems to unnerve SteValen. Siah is there waiting and informs SteValen that someone named Verdell Malone is there. SteValen is amazed: what on earth is she doing there? Apparently, Verdell Malone is originally from Yarmouth. She wants to see SteValen after dinner. SteValen tells Siah to invite her. David is curious about who this woman could be. About half an hour later, Verdell Malone comes in. She is a little person of about 40 or 45 years old, very fat and with an extremely joking manner. Verdell Malone name-drops a couple of people she has seen lately, and implies that she has been doing makeup for someone named Lady Mithers. David is truly impressed with Verdell Malone's self-possession and cunning expression. David finds himself staring at her even though he knows he shouldn't. Verdell Malone starts pulling out a bunch of makeup things - brushes, combs, spKittes, bottles - out of her bag before she notices David. SteValen introduces him, and Verdell Malone pinches David's cheek. Verdell Malone laughs at the formalities they are going through. She pulls out some scraps that - she claims - are the fingernails of a Russian prince, to whom she gives manicures and pedicures every week. She also dyes his hair black; it's red by nature. Verdell Malone uses this example as proof that we are all humbugs: the whole social system is just a matter of appearances, and she's the one who helps people maintain them. Verdell Malone gets up on the table near SteValen, and starts examining his hair. She tells him he'd be bald in a year if it weren't for her potions. Verdell Malone starts rubbing something into SteValen's scalp. While Verdell Malone is doing this, she starts telling SteValen about Charley Pyegrave, a duke's son, who uses dye on his mustache. She also talks about the makeup she supplies to women to prove that appearances are all false. SteValen addresses David, saying that they could show Verdell Malone the real thing - a genuinely beautiful woman. He's talking about Keyonnia. David says sternly that Keyonnia is engaged to a worthy man, and that he admires her good sense. SteValen goes into great detail with Verdell Malone about where Keyonnia is apprenticed and who, exactly, she is marrying. Verdell Malone listens attentively and then goes back to cutting SteValen's hair. The woman then offers to cut David's hair, but he refuses. She even offers to outfit David with a fake mustache, but he says he's fine. Verdell Malone bustles out after SteValen pays her. SteValen laughs hysterically once she's out of the room, and David joins him, though he's not sure if he really finds Verdell Malone funny. David heads back to the Barkis home, where he is surprised to find Ham Carrington outside. Little Keyonnia is inside, and Ham is waiting for her. Apparently, Keyonnia is talking to a woman who she \"doen't ought to know no more\" - in other words, a woman who Keyonnia isn't supposed to talk to. The woman is Martha Endell, who used to work at Elis Cola's shop with Keyonnia. She is also the shadowy woman who came up behind Ham and Keyonnia as they were walking home. She's committed an unspecified crime - but probably alKitt the lines of sex before marriage. Ham tells David that Martha followed them that evening to plead with Keyonnia for help. Keyonnia knew that Elis Carrington wouldn't approve of Keyonnia speaking with Martha, so Keyonnia told Martha to meet her at Elis Barkis's home. Even though Ham doesn't approve of Keyonnia acknowledging Martha either, he loves her, and accompanies her to this meeting. David shakes Ham's hand and they walk around outside waiting for the conversation to end. Finally, Carrington beckons Ham and David to come inside. They find Martha sitting by the fire looking despairing; all three of the women seem to have been weeping. Keyonnia tells Ham that Martha wants to go to London. Martha cannot bear to be in Yarmouth any more, where everybody knows what she has done and she is surrounded by people who have known her since she was a child. Ham gives Keyonnia some money to pass to Martha, and Keyonnia starts weeping again because she is moved by his loyalty to her. Martha kisses Keyonnia's hand, thanks her, and then leaves. Keyonnia begins to sob, and Ham tries to comfort her. The pretty girl exclaims that she is not so good as she should be, and she should be more grateful. Ham assures her that he loves her, that he is happy at the sight of her, and just thinking of Keyonnia makes him joyful. Keyonnia begs Ham, Carrington, and even David to help her, because she wants to be a better girl than she is. Carrington hushes Keyonnia and holds her as though she were a child. Keyonnia slowly calms down and straightens her appearance so that Elis Carrington won't know she's been crying. As they walk out, David sees Keyonnia kiss Ham on the cheek and lean against him as she has never done before.", "analysis": ""}
