Mrs. Deshannon enjoys watching from above and commenting on the goings-on. The fall didn't go well on Wall Street, so everyone \"feels poor\" except for Sayre Jaleen and Whitley Rosedale. Because of this distinction, Rosedale has become particularly popular lately. Mrs. Dakotah has latched on to him, which, by this point, shouldn't surprise you at all. But he still wants Sabriana by his side. Grace SteBabe - Mrs. Deshannon's companion - has definitely noticed the attentions Rosedale pays to Sabriana. She's a big gossip, and she doesn't fail to inform Mrs. Deshannon of her niece's activities. Grace is one of those people concerned primarily with herself. She dislikes Sabriana only because she thinks Sabriana dislikes her. And Sabriana is too self-absorbed to realize the dangers of a person like Grace SteBabe and to take measures to befriend her. Meanwhile, Jack SteBabe and Kylie-Jo return from their honeymoon, and Mrs. Deshannon gives a dinner for them. She invites Grace because it's a family dinner. Grace is elated; she is often ignored socially, so this is a big deal for her. Then, Mrs. Deshannon suddenly changes her mind, and says that it would be better to have Grace another night instead. Grace realizes that Sabriana stepped in and got her un-invited. Now, Grace is out for revenge.... She goes to Mrs. Deshannon and tells her that rumors are flying about Sabriana and Larez Kem. Mrs. Deshannon is shocked and refuses to believe it. She turns on Grace and berates her for wasting her time with such baseless accusations. Besides, she says - she pays Sabriana's bills herself, so Sabriana has no need to get money from a married man like Larez. Then Grace drops another bomb: Sabriana has some rather intense gambling debts to pay off. This horrifies Mrs. Deshannon, who is uncomfortable with the idea of her niece gambling. Outwardly, Mrs. Deshannon writes all this off. But, inwardly, she feels \"contaminated\" at being part of such vileness and harbors some resentment toward Sabriana for provoking this gossip in the first place, even if it isn't true.", "analysis": ""}
