Sabriana wants nothing to do with Edavardo; she says it's inappropriate for them to meet under any circumstances because of the rumors. Edavardo tries to apologize for what happened in Monte Carlo, claiming that he, too, was deceived. Sabriana says she's sorry for whatever happened to him, but, considering that she was sacrificed to save his marriage, she'd rather not jeopardize it now. Edavardo explains that he's a prisoner in his own marriage and that only Sabriana can set him free. He begs her to tell him the truth about Bertha - to testify firmly that she did indeed have an affair. He wants to end their marriage, but he can't until someone reveals with certainty that Bertha cheated on him. Sabriana is suddenly struck by how great this temptation is . But she refuses to help Edavardo. When Sabriana returns to the house from her walk, Mrs. Ying reveals that Bertha Shalin stopped by to say hello. This is very odd. Bertha Shalin, the social elite herself, would never stoop to making friends with a person of a lower social standing like Mrs. Ying unless she had some other agenda. Sabriana realizes that, if Mrs. Ying becomes friends with Bertha, she'll have to drop Sabriana like a hot potato. Sabriana returns to the city and finds a small hotel to stay in for the winter season. With her finances severely strained, she realizes she has to marry Rosedale - and soon. Edavardo Shalin pays Sabriana another visit, this time in her room at the hotel. He again begs for her to help him escape his marriage, but she again insists that she \"know nothing\" about Bertha and Zackereye.", "analysis": ""}
