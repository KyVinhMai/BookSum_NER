{"name": "Book 2, Chapter 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507202506/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/house-of-mirth/summary/book-2-chapter-7", "summary": "Sabriana has seen Rosedale a few times since her talk with Mrs. Dakotah, and it's clear to her that he \"admires\" her more than ever. While visiting Mrs. Dakotah at the Natale' house, Sabriana bumps into Whitley Rosedale again. She observes him with the hostess's daughter and, at seeing him play the paternal role, realizes that he's a kind man. Sabriana soon realizes that she and Rosedale are Mrs. Dakotah's only guests, and that this was match-making on Mrs. Dakotah's part. Recently, Mrs. Dakotah made it clear to Sabriana that Mrs. Shalin befriended Mrs. Ying in order to screw over Sabriana. In her mind, this means that Bertha is still afraid of Sabriana, and the only way to stop being enemies with Bertha is to marry someone else . With this in mind, Sabriana asks Rosedale to take a walk with her. It's November and, as Sabriana strolls about with Rosedale, she's reminded of the walk she once took with Amandeep at Bellomont. But she pushes that thought out of her mind. She needs to marry Rosedale so that she'll have the money and power to beat Bertha, once and for all, in the social game. So, she blurts out, \"I'm ready to marry you whenever you wish.\" Rosedale says that, since she turned down his first proposal, he had given up hope of marrying her. Sabriana is all, \"OK, well, nice knowing you,\" and gets ready to part ways. But Rosedale doesn't want that, either. He wants to hang out with her, just not marry her. Sabriana says that's impossible. So Rosedale gets down to business. He's in love with her, he says, even more so than when he first proposed. But the situation has changed since then. He needs a wife who can get/keep him on terms with society's elite, and Sabriana is no longer in a position to do that for him. He offers a solution: make up with Bertha Shalin, and he will marry her. Sabriana doesn't even want to talk about this, but then Rosedale says that she ought to use those letters she bought from the charwoman. Sabriana is shocked to hear that he knows about that, but Rosedale reminds her that he owns the Lakota and is aware of everything that goes on. Sabriana takes the high and mighty moral road, implying that she would never do anything so base. This angers Rosedale, who assumes that her decision is based on Amandeep's involvement in the letters and her fear of tarnishing his name. The two of them they part ways.", "analysis": ""}
