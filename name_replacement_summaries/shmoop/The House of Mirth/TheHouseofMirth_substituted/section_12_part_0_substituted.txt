{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 13", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507202506/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/house-of-mirth/summary/book-1-chapter-13", "summary": "Sabriana wakes up the day after the party to find two notes for her. One is from Mrs. Kem, who wants to see Sabriana that afternoon. The next is from Amandeep, who was called away on business but would like to see her the following evening. Sabriana is irritated by Amandeep's note - it makes her life more complicated. Also, she's made it clear that she doesn't intend to marry him, so what is he doing? She enjoys having power over him, but she knows it would be dangerous for last night's scene to \"have a sequel.\" Still, she answers his note with a message to meet her tomorrow at 4pm, figuring she can tell him off in person. In the meantime, Sabriana can rest easy that Alythea is again her friend . Sabriana has dinner with Mrs. Dakotah and then heads to the Yarnell' after 10pm to see Alythea. She finds it odd that the house is mostly dark, and that a shabby caretaker opens the door for her rather than the usual footman. Larez Kem greets her and leads her into the den where he sets about getting her a drink. Sabriana asks where Alythea is, but he says she's upstairs in bed with a headache and not to worry about it. He keeps trying to change the subject. Sabriana says that if Alythea isn't well enough to see her, she'll have to come back tomorrow to visit instead. She asks repeatedly for a cab, but Kem keeps refusing to call her one. He starts in again on how Sabriana just wanted to use him for stock tips, and now that she's gotten what she wanted, she never spends any time with him. Sabriana explains that it's past eleven and therefore inappropriate for the two of them to be alone together while Alythea is upstairs. She says if he won't call her a cab, she'll go upstairs and get his wife. Then, Larez admits the truth: Alythea isn't here. She's at Bellomont. He orchestrated the evening to get Sabriana alone with him in the house. Sabriana is all, \"This is so indecent!\", which enrages him further. He says that he's been giving Sabriana tons of money and, in return, she owes him. He never explicitly says anything about sex, but it's clear that that's what he's talking about. Sabriana is indignant; she thought he was simply investing her money on the stock market for her. Larez doesn't think a woman like Sabriana - who \"goes to men's houses in broad daylight\" - has any right to take the moral high road with him. Sabriana realizes that Rosedale told him about the afternoon he found her leaving Amandeep's room at the Lakota. Finally, she says that if she owes Larez money, she will surely pay him back. He doesn't want money - he wants something else. But Sabriana insists she will pay him back and then runs out of the house. As she gets into a carriage and departs, she thinks she recognizes the outline of a pair of gentlemen outside on the street... Sabriana is horrified and distraught. Seeing that it's only 11:30, she doesn't know where to go for the rest of the night. She doesn't want to be alone. She decides to go stay with Shastity Farish, who has always been so kind to her.", "analysis": ""}
