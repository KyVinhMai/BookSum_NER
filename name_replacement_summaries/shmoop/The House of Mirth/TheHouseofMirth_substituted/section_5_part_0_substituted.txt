{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507202506/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/house-of-mirth/summary/book-1-chapter-6", "summary": "Sabriana is taking a walk around Bellomont with Amandeep. Sabriana is conflicted; she feels excited at \"escaping\" the gilded cage of society with Amandeep, but she also feels scared at the risk of losing Macky. She wonders briefly if she feels love for Amandeep. She's only been in love once before, with a man named Sant Trenell, who ended up marrying one of the Van Osburgh daughters. Sabriana muses on what it is about Amandeep she likes so much. She believes he acts as though he's part of a superior race - even more so than the richest men she knows. Amandeep admits to Sabriana that he came to Bellomont to see her, not Mrs. Shalin. He says Sabriana is a \"wonderful spectacle\" and he wanted to see what she was up to. He also calls Sabriana out on her manipulative abilities. He thinks she's probably using him somehow to get to Macky - not that it bothers him. Sabriana admits to herself that this is about right - she doesn't want to seem over-eager with Macky, anyway. They banter some more, this time about the definition of success. Sabriana says it is to get as much out of life as one can. Amandeep disagrees; he thinks success is personal freedom. Sabriana admits she only knows personal freedom around Amandeep. This lament hits home for Amandeep; he realizes that Sabriana has a weakness, and that makes her more interesting to him . Amandeep tells Sabriana that she'll have a hard time finding personal freedom after she marries a rich man. Sabriana counters that Amandeep sure spends a lot of time hanging around the socialite people he claims to despise. This is true, he says, but he considers himself amphibious - he can live in her world, but he can breathe in another environment as well. After they talk some more about marriage and society, Sabriana concludes that her future is rather miserable, and that it looks even worse when she sees it through Amandeep's eyes. She particularly resents that he condemns her life choices without offering her any alternatives. Amandeep admits that, no, he has nothing to offer her as an alternative - but if he did, he would give it to her. Sabriana cries a bit and he tries to comfort her. She asks if he wants to marry her; he says no, but if she did, then he would. Then, they go back and forth calling each other cowards. Basically, they both know that if Sabriana did marry Amandeep she couldn't maintain her current lifestyle. Sabriana says that she would look hideous in the \"dowdy clothes\" she would have to wear as a woman of limited means, but that at least she knows how to trim her own hats. This light note effectively ends the conversation, and the couple heads back to the house.", "analysis": ""}
