It's mid-April, and while strolling about Amandeep bumps into Mrs. Dakotah, Mrs. Jack SteBabe , and Mrs. Jaz Jaleen. They're all standing around arguing over where they should have lunch. While they continue the lunch debate, Jack SteBabe spots the Sopheap' yacht, the Sabrina, returning to shore, and remarks that they are back. Both Sabriana and Zackereye Olayinka are on board with the couple. The socialites are pleased that Sabriana is back, because she's been a smash hit among the social elite here in Europe. The Big Kahuna with whom everyone wants to be seen is the Tien, who has taken a great liking to Miss Bart. Amandeep is all, \"Can I ever get away from this woman?\" He thought he was done with her, but seeing the yacht and hearing her name makes him realize he's not over Sabriana just yet. After lunch, Amandeep chats with Mrs. Dakotah. She explains that she came along as a companion to the Natale. The Natale have money, but no social currency, so it's Carry's job to ingratiate them with all the right people. It seems that, when Sabriana was in Aix ten years ago with Mrs. Deshannon, a rich, gorgeous Italian prince wanted to marry her. Then his stepson showed up and she flirted with him, which nixed the marriage proposal. Mrs. Dakotah offers one explanation: Sabriana does these things because she secretly despises the life she's trying to obtain. She thinks that's what makes Sabriana so interesting. Then, she explains the current situation aboard the Sabrina: Bertha is pursuing an affair with Zackereye Olayinka, and she needs Sabriana around to distract her husband Edavardo. Also, Sabriana has been snubbing the Natale, which is likely a bad decision on her part. Amandeep is all, \"Oh, look at the time\" and excuses himself, explaining that he needs to return to Nice. Later, alone in his hotel room, he wonders aloud what he's running away from. He feels that if he can go long enough without seeing Sabriana, he can \"return to a reasonable view\" of her. Unfortunately, he bumps into her at the train station. She's there with Zackereye Olayinka, the Sopheap, and Raynell Rayaan Dacey. And they're all headed to Nice to dine with the Tien. On the train, Amandeep has time to observe Sabriana in earnest: he finds that her beauty has \"hardened\" and she looks less youthful. He sees that she's made herself a useful tool to everyone around her. Amandeep also thinks she is \"on the brink of a chasm,\" which sounds to us like some pretty creepy foreshadowing. Later, once in Nice, Amandeep has dinner with a companion of his and then wanders around outside for a bit. He notices two figures getting into a cab together late at night - Bertha and Zackereye.", "analysis": ""}
