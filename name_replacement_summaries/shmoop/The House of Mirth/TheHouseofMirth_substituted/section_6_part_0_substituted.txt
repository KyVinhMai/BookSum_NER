{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507202506/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/house-of-mirth/summary/book-1-chapter-7", "summary": "Mrs. Kem berates Sabriana for being completely flaky and indecisive. Because Sabriana took Amandeep away from Bertha, Bertha retaliated and turned Macky against Sabriana by giving him all the dirt on her. She told him how Sabriana gambles, smokes, and doesn't go to church. Now, Macky has left Bellomont, essentially to run away from Sabriana. It takes a while, but Sabriana finally realizes how screwed she is. At lunch, Sabriana discovers that Amandeep has departed from Bellomont, in addition to Macky. Mrs. Shalin is there, playing nice on the surface, but obviously mean underneath. She's all, \"Oooh, Sabriana, I wonder why Mr. Oluwaseyi isn't here anymore! How curious!\" and that sort of thing. Sabriana suffers inwardly at the thought of the rich life she just lost. As Sabriana heads away from the table, Mrs. Kem asks her to go to the station and pick up her husband, Larez Kem, and bring him back to Bellomont. She said she would send Carry Dakotah, but she knows that Mrs. Dakotah is always trying to get money out of Larez. On the way to the station, Sabriana devises a plan to get out of her hidden debt with the help of Larez Kem. Of course, Sabriana knows that a married woman can do things that a single girl cannot . She decides that she'll have to tread carefully. Larez Kem is \"red and massive.\" Sabriana is well aware of the fact that he finds her attractive. Kem starts talking about his work. He admits to Sabriana that it takes a lot of time to keep Alythea in the lifestyle they live. He also says that he's made a good deal of money trading on tips from Whitley Rosedale - he wishes his wife would stop being so snobbish and invite Rosedale to dinner, since he's such a useful business acquaintance to have. Sabriana realizes this is the angle she can work. When they arrive at Bellomont, she asks Kem to keep driving, so they can enjoy this nice little carriage ride together a bit more. Sabriana starts lamenting how awful her financial situation is, how she can't play bridge anymore and can't buy such pretty dresses, etc. She asks for Kem's help in explaining to Alythea that Sabriana can't stay with them as she does. She needs to go back to her aunt's, where the social pressure to spend money all the time isn't there. This touches Kem. He hates the thought of the beautiful Sabriana Bart having to do without. He asks for her to give him the small amount of money she has - about 500 dollars - and let him speculate with it on the stock market. Sabriana is relieved, and exhilarated with the sense of her own power.", "analysis": ""}
