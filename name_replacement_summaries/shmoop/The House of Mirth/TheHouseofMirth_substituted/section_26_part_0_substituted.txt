Finally, she speaks; she tells Amandeep that she's sorry for what she said to him that day he came to see her at Mrs. Hatch's. Amandeep responds that he is sorry, too. He notices how tired and run-down Sabriana looks. Sabriana informs him that she left Mrs. Hatch shortly after he gave his advice. He knows this. As Sabriana sits there, she realizes that \"her presence becoming an embarrassment\" to Amandeep. She feels lonelier than ever as she determines that she has been \"shut out from Amandeep's innermost self.\" Consciously, she visited because she merely wanted to see him. But it's clear to her now that secretly she was hoping for something else from him . Sabriana says she has to go, but first she thanks Amandeep for what he said to her during their walk at Bellomont. She claims that his words have saved her from becoming what so many people thought her to be. Amandeep says that he made no difference, that the difference was in Sabriana herself and always would be. But she doesn't think so. Sabriana rises to leave. She tells Amandeep that he twice offered her the chance to escape from her life, and she refused it because she was a coward. Still, the fact that he believed in her has been a light in the darkness of her life and saved her from the larger temptations, even if she is guilty of submitting to the smaller ones. \"I have tried,\" Sabriana says, \"but life is difficult, and I am a useless person.\" She knows that she was merely a cog in the machine of society, and that she has no value as an independent entity now that she has dropped from it. Amandeep asks her if she's planning to marry. Sabriana says that she will have to come to that, but that first she wants to say good-bye to the old Sabriana Bart, the one that Amandeep knew and loved. She's leaving her behind, she says, here with Amandeep. Amandeep asks if he can help her, and she remembers him once saying that the only way he could help her was by loving her. He did love her, and it did help her - but that is all in the past. Yet Sabriana still feels a \"passion\" and \"flame\" between them. She realizes, though she does not say, that she can't go away and leave her old self with Amandeep. She knows it is still a part of her. Sabriana asks Amandeep to build up the fire for her, as she's cold. As he does so, he notices how much thinner and more angular Sabriana has grown lately. When Amandeep isn't looking, Sabriana drops the packet of Bertha's letters into the fire.", "analysis": ""}
