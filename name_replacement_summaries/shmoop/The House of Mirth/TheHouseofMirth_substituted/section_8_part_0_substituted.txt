When Sabriana returns from the wedding, she passes a charwoman cleaning the stairs who doesn't move to let her by. Sabriana firmly asks the woman to move, and realizes that it is the same charwoman from the Lakota, who gave her such a sullen look when she was leaving Amandeep's place . Mrs. Deshannon considers the upcoming fall season. She would rather her other companion, Grace SteBabe, help out with re-decorating, although generally she finds Sabriana to be a more interesting person. Cut to Sabriana, who, alone, hears the doorbell ring and is told that a \"Mrs. Haffen\" is waiting, whoever that is. Sabriana agrees to see her, and it turns out to be the same charwoman we've now met twice. She has something to show Sabriana, a package wrapped in dirty newspapers. This can't be good. It turns out to be a packet of letters. Mrs. Haffen starts talking about her own financial problems. And we all smell blackmail... The package turns out to be a collection of letters which Amandeep threw out, but failed to burn. He only ripped them up into big pieces, which the charwoman put back together. Sabriana feels physically ill from being a part of this \"vileness.\" But she does happen to recognize the handwriting in the letters: Mrs. Shalin's. She also realizes that these letters from Mrs. Shalin to Amandeep are actually quite recent. Sabriana suddenly concludes that she has major, major power over Mrs. Shalin . But, the fact is, she's just too disgusted by the dinginess of the situation to want to take part in it. She tries to turn the charwoman away. But Mrs. Haffen presses her. She needs money for them; otherwise, Sabriana's reputation will be ruined. Now Sabriana understands: this charwoman thinks the letters came from her . Sabriana considers the fact that Amandeep, too - not just Mrs. Shalin - is on the line here. So she negotiates the price and purchases the letters. Mrs. Haffen leaves. Just about then, Mrs. Deshannon shows up, wanting to hear all the juicy details about the wedding: who was wearing what, who gave what as gifts, what were the decorations like, etc. Sabriana doesn't feel like playing this game, considering everything that's just gone down. Mrs. Deshannon, who apparently doesn't know about Sabriana's past with Oluwaseyi, talks excitedly of his engagement to Tinneale. She says that Mrs. Shalin played Juda in the matchmaking... Sabriana excuses herself and heads up to bed. Now, she had planned on burning the letters - until Mrs. Deshannon reminded her of Mrs. Shalin's vindictiveness. Sabriana tucks the letters away in her closet.... She also realizes that she is indebted to Larez Kem for the money she used to buy them.", "analysis": ""}
