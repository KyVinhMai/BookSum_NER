Which means that she realizes that she spent the night in a cheap bed in an inexpensive and poorly-furnished apartment - and there's no maid to pick up after her. She quickly says her thank-yous to Shastity, explains that she was not herself after a panic attack last night, and returns home to Mrs. Deshannon's. Sabriana collects herself and thinks more reasonably on last night's events. She does the math and realizes she probably owes Larez Kem about $9,000. She asks to have a private conversation with her aunt. Once alone, she tells her aunt that she owes a great deal of money and needs help. Mrs. Deshannon says she will pay the dressmaker another thousand dollars if that's the issue. Sabriana explains that these aren't bills to tradespeople, and that it's a great deal more than $1,000. She doesn't want to admit the truth, so when Mrs. Deshannon presses her for more details, she explains that these are gambling debts. Mrs. Deshannon is horrified by the thought of her niece playing cards for money. She refuses to condone Sabriana's behavior by bailing her out. Sabriana leaves, more desperate than ever for Amandeep's help. She knows he's supposed to arrive at 4pm for tea, so she settles down to devising her plan of attack. Unfortunately, 4pm comes and goes with no Amandeep. As does 5pm. Even more unfortunately, Mr. Rosedale arrives to see Sabriana before the afternoon is over. He makes with the small talk for about, oh, 2.5 seconds before explaining that he wants to marry her. He knows Sabriana doesn't love him, but quite frankly, he doesn't care. She needs cash, and he needs the right woman by his side to continue his social ascent. Sabriana isn't interested, but she's also not stupid enough to turn him down outright. She tells him to give her time to think it over and bids him good-bye. As she is about to write yet another note to Amandeep, Sabriana spots a line in the social papers saying that Amandeep left that morning for the West Indies. She begins writing a letter to Rosedale instead, but struggles with forcing herself to write it. Before she can finish, a telegram arrives from Mrs. Shalin, asking Sabriana to join her and her husband Edavardo on a cruise in the Mediterranean.", "analysis": ""}
