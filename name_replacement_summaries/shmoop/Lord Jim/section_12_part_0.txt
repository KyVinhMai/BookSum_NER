By the way, we learn that this conversation took place three years after Jim's trial, at which point Jim was working as a water-clerk. This reminds Marlow of another one-time water-clerk named Bob Stanton, who drowned while trying to rescue a woman from a sinking ship. We now interrupt this digression to bring you back to Jim and Marlow's conversation. We go back to the night of Jim and Marlow's conversation. Jim is going to be sentenced the next day, so Marlow offers him some cash to skip town, just as Captain Brierly suggested. But Jim is more moral than Marlow gives him credit for. He refuses and insists on seeing the trial through to the end. The pair parts awkwardly, and Jim runs off into the night.", "analysis": ""}
