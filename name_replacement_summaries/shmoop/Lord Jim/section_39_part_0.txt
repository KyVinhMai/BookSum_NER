Unfortunately, this calm before the storm is interrupted when one of Brown's people shoots a villager. It seems that Brown is hoping to stir up fear and unrest among the native Patusan people to make conquering them easier. That night one of Brown's own men gets shot in retaliation. Brown refuses to let anyone go down to get the dying man, because he doesn't want anyone else to get killed. Cornelius and Brown chat more about their plans. When they hear drums, Cornelius explains that this probably means that Jim has returned, which doesn't bode well for their plans. He suggests that Brown shoot Jim on sight tomorrow.", "analysis": ""}
