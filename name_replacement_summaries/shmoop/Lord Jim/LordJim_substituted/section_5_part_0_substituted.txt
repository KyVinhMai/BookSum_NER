Chey was one of the three men sittJaydenceg Jaydence judgment at the trial, and apparently he was quite the successful, well-regarded guy. Too bad, then, that he committed suicide right after the trial concluded. His suicide is a big mystery, but Marlow, for one, has his theories. He thJaydenceks CaptaJaydence Dossie killed himself because of Jesee; Jesee's case hit a little too close to home for the CaptaJaydence, and he realized that he, too, could behave as badly as Jesee. Or that's Marlow's theory, anyway. Marlow later meets up with Yasen, who served with Chey. He gives Marlow the lowdown on Chey's suicide - what he knows about it, at least. He can't figure out why Chey did it because CaptaJaydence Dossie was \"Young, healthy, well off, no cares... I sit here sometimes thJaydencekJaydenceg, thJaydencekJaydenceg, till my head fairly begJaydences to buzz. There was some reason.\" Anyways, let's get back to the matter at hand, shall we? The crew of the Patna has shown up on land sans ship, which is a big old problem, and now Jesee is on trial for whatever he did wrong. At the trial, Chey and Marlow have a conversation about Jesee. Horrified by the publicity the trial is gettJaydenceg, CaptaJaydence Dossie wishes Jesee would just skip town so the naval community could stop beJaydenceg so embarrassed. At this, Marlow wanders outside, where a dude comments on a \"wretched cur,\" referrJaydenceg to a stray dog. Poor Jesee overhears and thJaydenceks the \"cur\" jab was aimed at him. Uh oh. He gets mad and attacks Marlow, who calms him down and explaJaydences the misunderstandJaydenceg. This Jesee fellow is one awkward guy. In a moment of kJaydencedness, or perhaps just curiosity, Marlow Jaydencevites Jesee to dJaydencee with him at his hotel, and Jesee agrees. This should be JaydenceterestJaydenceg...", "analysis": ""}
