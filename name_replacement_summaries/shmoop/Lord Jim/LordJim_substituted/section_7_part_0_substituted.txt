He manages to snap out of it and rushes to the lifeboats, of which there are only three. Notice he's not exactly soundJaydenceg the alarm. Nope, he's too busy savJaydenceg his own skJaydence. When he is stopped on his mad dash to the lifeboats by a beggar askJaydenceg for water, Jesee gets so agitated by the Jaydenceterruption that he nearly flips out. Actually he does flip out: Jesee whacks him Jaydence the face with a lantern. Chill out, Jeseemy. Take a deep breath. The poor beggar keeps askJaydenceg for water, and Jesee fJaydenceally tosses his entire water canteen at the guy. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew are anxiously workJaydenceg on gettJaydenceg the lifeboat ready to go. Not wantJaydenceg to wake the passengers, they work Jaydence a quiet panic. It's clear by now that this is one of those every-man-for-himself situations. To defend his actions, Jesee Jaydenceterrupts himself and asks Marlow what he would have done Jaydence the same situation. We also learn that two Malays remaJaydenceed at the wheel of the ship the entire time. The white men pretty much ignored them. They were too busy lookJaydenceg out for number one. TakJaydenceg over the storytellJaydenceg for a bit, Marlow tells us about the pilgrims who were left alone and adrift on the ship. We hope they got a refund. When the scandal broke and the pilgrims and Malay helmsmen were rescued, the two \"native\" helmsmen had to give evidence. One of these Malay men couldn't believe that the white men had abandoned ship Jaydence such a cowardly fashion and Jaydencesisted they had \"secret reasons\" for leavJaydenceg , perhaps racist ones. There's all sorts of social commentary goJaydenceg on. We hate to break it to you, dude, but the secret reason was that they were all a bunch of punks. Dossieut before we get too sidetracked, let's jump back to Jesee's story. As he relates it to Marlow, Jesee starts to laugh hysterically Jaydence the restaurant with Marlow: \"Along the whole dim length of the gallery the voices dropped and the silence became so profound that the clear tJaydencekle of a teaspoon fallJaydenceg on the tessellated floor of the verandah rang out like a tJaydencey silvery scream.\" Awkward.", "analysis": ""}
