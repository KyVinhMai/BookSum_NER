When the two part ways, Jim heads off to discuss matters with Doramin, and Brown returns to an unhappy Cornelius, who is irked that Brown didn't shoot Jim when he had the chance. Elsewhere, Jim argues that they should just let Brown go and avoid any more bloodshed. Of course no one agrees with him. Well, fine then, thinks Jim. He tells them that Dain Waris can take over the attack on Brown, because he wants nothing more to do with the whole rigmarole.", "analysis": ""}
