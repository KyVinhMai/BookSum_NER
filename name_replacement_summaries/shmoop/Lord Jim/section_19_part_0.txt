We learn that he was a political revolutionary and adventurer who lived in Malaysia for many years. He was even married to a princess there, with whom he had a baby daughter. But his wife and daughter died, and Stein has lived alone ever since. A noted naturalist, he collects butterflies, and he tells Marlow the story of the day he captured his most prized one. Cue another digression. After getting a run-down on Stein, Marlow tells Stein Jim's story. Stein is sympathetic. He thinks Jim's problem is that he's a romantic. Well that doesn't sound so bad, right? In the end, Stein agrees to help Jim. We hope this turns out better than the last time someone tried to help our guy.", "analysis": ""}
