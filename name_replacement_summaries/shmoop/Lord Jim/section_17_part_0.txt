Jim's employer has even sent a letter to Marlow praising Jim. But then Marlow receives another letter saying that Jim has quit and is gone. Yet another letter arrives from Jim explaining that he quit because the second engineer from the Patna showed up. Jim had to flee to keep his story under wraps. Luckily, he gets a job with ship chandlers Egstrom and Blake, who both like him a lot. Unfortunately, Jim's little problem just won't go away. The Patna scandal comes up in conversation, and a captain named O'Brien goes on a rant about it. This prompts a shamed Jim to run away yet again. Egstrom and Marlow discuss the situation, and both are frustrated with Jim, whom they find stubborn and impulsive.", "analysis": ""}
