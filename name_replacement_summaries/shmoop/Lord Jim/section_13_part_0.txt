We're betting Jim does, too. The next day he goes to Jim's sentencing, at which the court finds the crew members derelict in their duty and strip them of their officer certification. There you have it, folks: Jim has been publicly shamed. After the trial Marlow runs into two guys named Chester and Captain Robinson, who are planning some shady business and want to offer Jim a job. But Marlow, looking out for his new buddy, refuses to pass along the offer and the two men leave in a huff. Good one, Marlow. Way to be a friend.", "analysis": ""}
