He gets a gig with the Yucker Brothers, which once again starts out well, but then Jim gets into a barroom brawl with a Danish guy over the Patna affair and has to skip town yet again. You'd think that would teach him a lesson, right? Alas, not so much. When Marlow gets him another job with a dude named De Jongh, Jim promptly quits that one, too. At his wits' end, Marlow decides to discuss Jim with a friend of his, a German merchant and naturalist named Stein.", "analysis": ""}
