Arcadian refers to a region in ancient Greece , and the word has come to mean a simple, peaceful, country region. And when he says \"the bush,\" he's referring to the wilderness or countryside. It appears Jim made a life for himself somewhere quiet and unpopulated. But before we get too far into Jim's current situation, Marlow wants to give us some more details about this Chester guy. He tells us Chester was at sea in a hurricane not too long after his meeting with Marlow. Back at Marlow's hotel, he wraps up his letters on behalf of Jim, and the two of them start to chat. But the ever-awkward Jim tries to rush off. Marlow calls him back.", "analysis": ""}
