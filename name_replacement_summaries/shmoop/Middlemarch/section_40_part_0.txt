Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, as everyone now has to call him , has a visitor - a guy named John Raffles. Apparently Raffles had married Rigg's mother, and Rigg has never liked his stepfather . Raffles is after money, of course. Rigg is ashamed of his stepfather; Raffles knows it and is hoping that Rigg will pay him to stay away. Rigg doesn't disappoint - he gives Raffles a brandy bottle to top up his flask, and a sovereign . Raffles fills his flask from the bottle, and wedges it closed with a letter he found lying around - something signed by \"Nicholas Bulstrode\" - and takes off.", "analysis": ""}
