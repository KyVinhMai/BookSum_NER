Mr. Brooke comes home and asks to speak with Dorothea in his library. He says that he'd had lunch with Mr. Casaubon on his way home, and that Mr. Casaubon had asked his permission to propose to Dorothea. Dorothea tells her uncle that, when and if Mr. Casaubon proposes to her, she'll accept him. Mr. Brooke is totally blown away by the news, and rambles on about how maybe Mr. Casaubon will suit her better than a younger man, after all, since she's so interested in books and ideas and stuff. Dorothea leaves Mr. Brooke bewildered about women. He really doesn't get Dorothea at all.", "analysis": ""}
