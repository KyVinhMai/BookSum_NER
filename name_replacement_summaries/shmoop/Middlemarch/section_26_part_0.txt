Mrs. Vincy is a mess - Fred was always her favorite child. But under Lydgate's care, Fred mends quickly. He continues to check on him twice a day, though, and spends evenings listening to Rosamond sing and play the piano. They flirt a lot, but Lydgate thinks he's safe from falling in love. Rosamond, meanwhile, is secretly planning her future with Lydgate. Not, mind, because she thinks he's rich. She knows he's not - but then, she doesn't really think about money at all. She knows money is necessary, but doesn't think about where it comes from. She just assumes someone will always provide it. One evening, Ned Plymdale, the son of a local businessman, is visiting the Vincys. He's already proposed to Rosamond once, and was rejected. He's persistent, though. He brought a magazine to look through with Rosamond. It's called the Keepsake, and it's pretty cheesy. . When Lydgate arrives, he plops down on the couch next to Rosamond , and picks up the magazine. He glances through it, and makes fun of it for being so cheesy. Plymdale is displeased, and tries to defend it, but Rosamond doesn't exactly help. At the end of the chapter, Lydgate is called by a servant of Sir James Chettam's to attend a patient at Lowick manor.", "analysis": ""}
