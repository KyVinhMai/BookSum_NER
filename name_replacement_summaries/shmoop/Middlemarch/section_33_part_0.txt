Celia and Sir James , Lady Chettam , Mr. Brooke, Dorothea, and Mrs. Cadwallader all watch the procession from a window at Lowick. Mr. Casaubon has politely welcomed the group, and then slipped off to his library to work despite Lydgate's warnings. Dorothea's glad to have the company, though. Ordinarily she'd be shut up in the library with Mr. Casaubon. As the funeral passes, Sir James recognizes Mr. and Mrs. Vincy and their son, Fred, along with Mr. Lydgate and a pretty young woman . After they're done watching the funeral, Mr. Brooke shows up with the news that Ladislaw is staying with him, and will arrive shortly. Mr. Casaubon, who has joined them from the library, is less than pleased - he figures Dorothea asked her uncle to invite Will to stay with him at the Grange. Mr. Brooke is totally oblivious, though, and goes on and on about how great Will Ladislaw is, and how he'll help to put his papers in order. Will sent the portrait of Mr. Casaubon as St. Thomas Aquinas with Mr. Brooke.", "analysis": ""}
