He tells her bluntly what he's done, and what it'll mean for her family. She thinks immediately of her parents, and the sacrifice this will mean for them. He apologizes again and again, and she doesn't bother to lecture him - what good would it do? He promises to do anything she asks to make it right. She tells him she'd be ashamed to love someone as lazy as he is, and then has a few nicer things to say to him, when she sees how upset he really is. Her father comes that evening to see her. Mary expected that they'd need to borrow money from her, and has put her entire savings into a bag for him. Mr. Garth doesn't care about money - he's more concerned about Mary's relationship with Fred. He thinks she's in love with him , and he's afraid he's not reliable enough. He warns her gently, and she assures him that she could never marry a man who doesn't work for his living.", "analysis": ""}
