Historical Note: this places the story in May of 1832. The Reform Bill ends up passing by June of the same year. Back to the story: the conversation is interrupted when Mr. Brooke arrives. He has bad news, he says: Dorothea is engaged to Will Ladislaw. Sir James is furious, and Mr. Cadwallader tries to calm him down. Sir James swears that he'll never see her again. After everyone else has left, Celia goes to visit Dorothea. Celia tries to dissuade Dorothea from marrying Will, but Dorothea, of course, won't be dissuaded. She says they'll live in London, and that she hopes that Sir James will forgive her someday so that Celia will be able to come and visit. Finally Celia gives up trying to persuade Dorothea to give it up, and asks to hear the whole story. But Dorothea knows that Celia would never understand.", "analysis": ""}
