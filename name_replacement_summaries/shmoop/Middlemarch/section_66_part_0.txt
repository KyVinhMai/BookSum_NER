He decides to ask for money from Mr. Bulstrode, even though he always had intended to stay financially independent of him. After all, he reasons, he's been working for Bulstrode's new hospital for free, and that's a major time commitment. He's still wavering about whether or not to ask him when Bulstrode calls him to his house - he doesn't feel well, and wants to see a doctor. Lydgate advises that he relax more . The subject turns to the hospital. Lydgate hints that he'd like a salary, instead of working gratis. But Bulstrode puts him off and says that Mrs. Casaubon is planning on taking over as the primary source of funds for the hospital. Lydgate says he'll talk to her, then. Bulstrode encourages that, but adds that Mrs. Casaubon is out of town at the moment. So then Lydgate asks for a straight-up loan from Bulstrode. Bulstrode declines, and suggests that Lydgate declare bankruptcy. Lydgate's not encouraged by this advice, and leaves.", "analysis": ""}
