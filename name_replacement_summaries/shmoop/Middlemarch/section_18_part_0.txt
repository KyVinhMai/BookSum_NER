Will Ladislaw is there, too , to study art and travel. Will's friend, Naumann, sees Dorothea across a gallery in a museum, and thinks she's as lovely as the statues she's looking at. Will sees who it is, and isn't happy about it. Naumann wants to be introduced to them, because he wants to paint Dorothea's portrait . Will objects to the idea of trying to capture Dorothea's essence in painting. He doesn't like Dorothea much , but he thinks she's too complicated to try to capture in a painting.", "analysis": ""}
