After a while, Miss Noble comes in. Will Ladislaw sent her, she says, because he's afraid that he's offended Dorothea, and wants to see her for a few minutes. He's waiting outside. Dorothea can't refuse. Miss Noble leaves, and sends Will in. Will at first tells her about the Bulstrode affair, and the new information about his mother's side of the family. Dorothea doesn't think worse of him for that, of course. And then Will says that he was never \"untrue\" to her, and she believes it. A storm is brewing outside, and a tremendous bolt of lightning is like \"the terror of a hopeless love\" . Will says that he shouldn't have said so much - he meant to leave without telling her how much he loved her, since they will always be divided. Then they smooch. They sit together for a few minutes, and then Will jumps up and says that he has to go, since they can never be married. Finally Dorothea tells him that they could. Her own fortune is seven hundred pounds a year, and that's more than enough - she doesn't need the additional nineteen hundred from Casaubon's fortune.", "analysis": ""}
