His brothers and sisters think that they and their children have a better right to the inheritance than Mr. Featherstone's dead wives' nieces and nephews . Poor Mary Garth is in charge of running Mr. Featherstone's household for him, so she has to put up with all these vulture-like relatives hanging around all the time. When Featherstone finds out that all these relatives are in his house, he flies into a rage, and tells them that he's already made his will. Fred is a welcome visitor, though, and that makes the other relatives even more furious and jealous. One person they didn't anticipate, though, is Mr. Trumbull - he's an auctioneer, and has worked with Mr. Featherstone on various business matters in the past. Trumbull has a private conversation with Mr. Featherstone, and Featherstone's brothers and sisters wonder what it was about. Trumbull doesn't tell them, though, and loiters in the kitchen for a snack to torment them by not telling them what he knows about Featherstone's will.", "analysis": ""}
