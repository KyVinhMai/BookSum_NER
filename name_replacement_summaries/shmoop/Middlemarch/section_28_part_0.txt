Mr. Casaubon opens a letter from Will Ladislaw, and finds an enclosed note to Dorothea. He hands her the sealed note, and isn't very happy about it. Dorothea's completely innocent. She thinks of Will only as a relative of her husband's who has been kind to her - she has no idea that Casaubon is jealous of Will. In his note to Mr. Casaubon, Will has suggested that he swing by for a visit when he returns to England. Mr. Casaubon repeats this to Dorothea, and tells her not to get her hopes up - he's too busy to entertain visitors. Dorothea's annoyed that Casaubon should assume that she would want to see Will if he doesn't. After all, he's his cousin, not hers. After this minor tiff, Casaubon leaves the room and promptly has what appears to be a minor heart attack. Dorothea catches him and takes him the couch, just as Celia, Sir James, and Mr. Brooke arrive for a visit. Sir James immediately sends his servant for Lydgate .", "analysis": ""}
