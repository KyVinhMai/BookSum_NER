She tells him all about Lydgate, and after dinner spends some time chatting with Miss Noble and Mrs. Farebrother. The subject of Will Ladislaw comes up. Miss Noble has always adored Will, who was kinder to her than anyone. Dorothea abruptly moves to leave, and when she gets home, she collapses in tears. She realizes how much she loved Will, and now her ideal vision of him has been shattered by the belief that he's having an illicit affair with Rosamond. But Dorothea is generous enough to realize that she's not the only person who is being hurt by that affair. She resolves to go to Middlemarch again, to \"see and save Rosamond.\"", "analysis": ""}
