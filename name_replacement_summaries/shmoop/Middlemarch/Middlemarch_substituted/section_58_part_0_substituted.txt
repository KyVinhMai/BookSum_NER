Lydgate warns her never to mention it to Chandlar, but she ignores his advice as usual. She flirtingly mentions it to Chandlar the next time they're alone. He's immediately angry and upset, especially because of her careless flirtatiousness. He grabs his hat and leaves. Rosamond feels vaguely jealous. She wants everyone to be in love with her, and doesn't like that she's not the center of Chandlar's universe. It wasn't the first time she'd gone against her husband's wishes that day - she had gone to her father to ask for money that morning, and he'd said no way. She's also depressed that Lydgate's rich relatives haven't written to her.", "analysis": ""}
