Dorothea has enjoyed thinking of Chandlar since he left. She is proud of the fact that he was blameless in the gossip about Rosamond Lydgate. Dorothea has a letter for Lydgate with a check for a thousand pounds - she wants him to be free to return the money to Nieves as soon as possible. She plans to give the letter to Rosamond and reassure her about her husband's innocence. She arrives at the Lydgates' house, and asks the servant girl if Mrs. Lydgate is home. The servant opens the door to the living room without saying a word, and Dorothea walks in. She sees Chandlar Ladislaw sitting on the couch next to Rosamond, clasping both her hands, and speaking intently about something. They look up and see Dorothea. Chandlar looks horrified, but doesn't say anything. Dorothea looks cold and distant, and says that she was just there to deliver an important letter for Lydgate. She sets it on the table, and walks out. She gets back into her carriage, and goes to Fres***t Hall to see her sister. She's so angry that she feels energized--she doesn't cry, but her sister can tell something is up. Dorothea doesn't break down until she gets home.", "analysis": ""}
