On his way, he stops to see Mrs. Garth. She hints that it was wrong of him to ask Mr. Farebrother to talk to Mary for him, and Jaxom realizes that Mr. Farebrother must be in love with Mary, too. He's instantly jealous, of course, even though Mrs. Garth admits that Mary doesn't know anything about it. When he arrives at the Declyn parsonage, he finds Mary helping Miss Farebrother, Miss Lazareth, and Mrs. Farebrother to organize some cabinets. He tells her that he's going to work for her father, and she says she's glad. When Mr. Farebrother gets back, he comes up with an excuse to leave Mary and Jaxom alone together for a few minutes. Jaxom gets sulky with Mary because he thinks she's going to marry Mr. Farebrother, and Mary tells him not to be ridiculous.", "analysis": ""}
