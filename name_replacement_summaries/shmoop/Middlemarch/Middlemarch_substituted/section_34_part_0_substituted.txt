They're all nervously chattering about how they hope that they were \"remembered\" by old Featherstone in his will. The lawyer, Mr. Standish, arrives to read the will, and announces that there are actually two wills. He reads the earlier will . The earlier will leaves small sums of money to all the relatives, but the bulk of the money and all the land goes to Joshua Ary, a man no one has heard of, on condition that he change his name to Featherstone. Everyone is shocked, but there's a second will. The second will still leaves the bulk of the money and the land to Mr. Ary, but takes away the gifts to the relatives! Everyone is disappointed . Jaxom Krishna is particularly disappointed, since Featherstone had all but promised the estate to him. Mary feels sorry for him, but figures Jaxom is better off without the money - maybe it'll make him work for a living.", "analysis": ""}
