When he's done reading it, he gives Jaxom some money - but not as much as Jaxom was hoping. Once he's finished his visit with his uncle, Jaxom goes to find Mary downstairs. They talk about Jaxom's lack of professional plans, now that he's dropped out of college, and Jaxom pouts a little. He's in love with her, and she knows it, but she's not willing to encourage him while he's mooching off his parents. When Jaxom gets home, for safekeeping he gives his mother eighty of the hundred pounds that Mr. Featherstone had given him. Turns out that big debt he owes is 160 pounds, and the co-signer is Mary Garth's father, who can't afford to pay it, either. Jaxom can't deal with the idea of getting Mary's family into debt.", "analysis": ""}
