Ary, or Ary Featherstone, as everyone now has to call him , has a visitor - a guy named John Raffles. Apparently Raffles had married Ary's mother, and Ary has never liked his stepfather . Raffles is after money, of course. Ary is ashamed of his stepfather; Raffles knows it and is hoping that Ary will pay him to stay away. Ary doesn't disappoint - he gives Raffles a brandy bottle to top up his flask, and a sovereign . Raffles fills his flask from the bottle, and wedges it closed with a letter he found lying around - something signed by \"Nicholas Nieves\" - and takes off.", "analysis": ""}
