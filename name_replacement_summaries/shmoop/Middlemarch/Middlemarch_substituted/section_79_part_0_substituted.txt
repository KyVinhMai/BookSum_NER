She tells him all about Lydgate, and after dinner spends some time chatting with Miss Lazareth and Mrs. Farebrother. The subject of Chandlar Ladislaw comes up. Miss Lazareth has always adored Chandlar, who was kinder to her than anyone. Dorothea abruptly moves to leave, and when she gets home, she collapses in tears. She realizes how much she loved Chandlar, and now her ideal vision of him has been shattered by the belief that he's having an illicit affair with Rosamond. But Dorothea is generous enough to realize that she's not the only person who is being hurt by that affair. She resolves to go to Middlemarch again, to \"see and save Rosamond.\"", "analysis": ""}
