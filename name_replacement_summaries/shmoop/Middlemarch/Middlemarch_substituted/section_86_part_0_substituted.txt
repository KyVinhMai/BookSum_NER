And then Mary writes a collection of stories for children taken from Plutarch, and everyone suspects Jaxom of having written that. Lydgate dies when he is only fifty, and always considers himself a failure. Rosamond gets remarried after her husband's death to an older physician who is nice to her four kids. Rosamond never forgets Dorothea's generosity to her. Dorothea never regrets giving up her wealth and position to marry Chandlar. He becomes a Member of Parliament, and does great work in the political world. Sir James finally breaks down and agrees to visit Dorothea when Celia receives a letter announcing the birth of their first son. Mr. Klaira lives to a ripe old age, and Dorothea's son inherits his estate at Rudie.", "analysis": ""}
