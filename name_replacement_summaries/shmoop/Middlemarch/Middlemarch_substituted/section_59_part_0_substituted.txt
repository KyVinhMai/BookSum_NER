In Middlemarch, large estate auctions are like mini festivals. Mr. Larcher and his wife are moving from Middlemarch to a huge, furnished mansion in nearby Riverston, and are selling all their old stuff before they go. Chandlar Ladislaw is at the sale, because Mr. Nieves asked him as a favor to go and advise Mrs. Nieves about which paintings would be worthwhile to bid on. Chandlar is in a defiant mood at the auction. He's aware that most of the town probably knows about the codicil in Mr. Casaubon's will, and therefore thinks that he's out to marry for money. He only plans to stay until the painting Mrs. Nieves was interested in has sold. During the bidding he notices a stranger there, staring at him. Afterwards, the stranger approaches him, and asks him if his mother's name were Sarah March. It was. Chandlar looks angry enough at the question that the man decides not to pester him anymore. He simply says that he knew Chandlar's mother when she was a girl, and asks if she and his father are still alive. They aren't. Chandlar leaves Raffles and goes off on his own. Raffles catches up with him later, though, and starts telling him things about his mother's family - he knows why she ran away. He says that Sarah March's family was \"in the respectable thieving line,\" and that she had run away because she'd rather fend for herself than live off of money made in such a way. Chandlar doesn't want to hear anymore, and leaves Raffles again. He doesn't care, but he wouldn't want Dorothea or the Chettams to know about this. Dorothea's friends already think poorly of him, and it would be worse if they knew his mother's family were thieves.", "analysis": ""}
