So now the horse is worthless, and Jaxom only has fifty pounds towards repaying the debt. He decides that the only thing he can do is to go and confess everything to Mr. Garth, and then go and tell Mary himself. Mr. Garth isn't at his office, so Jaxom goes to his house. Mrs. Garth is there, working in the kitchen while teaching two of the younger children at the same time. Mrs. Garth is an intelligent and serious woman, but she feels motherly towards Jaxom in spite of his occasional stupidity. She doesn't know anything about the debt that her husband had co-signed, though. She's happy to see Jaxom, and invites him to sit and wait for Caleb to come home. While Jaxom waits, Mrs. Garth tells him about their plan to send Alfred, the oldest of the boys, to school for a good education. They've been saving money for it, and have just scraped 92 pounds together for the purpose. Jaxom winces when he hears this - all that money is going to have to go to pay the debt. He tells them both when Mr. Garth comes home, and Mrs. Garth immediately realizes that they'll have to give up Alfred's school money, and borrow money from Mary, besides. Jaxom leaves them to discuss it by themselves. Mrs. Garth tells Caleb that he'll have to stop working for free so often.", "analysis": ""}
