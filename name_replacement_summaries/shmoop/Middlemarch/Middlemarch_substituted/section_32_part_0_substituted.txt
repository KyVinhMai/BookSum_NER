He wakes up and calls her over to his bedside. He asks her to get his will out of the safe, and gives her the keys. He wants her to burn the second will so that only the first will be valid. She refuses - without any witnesses in the room, messing with his will, even at his request, could get her in a lot of trouble. He gets frustrated, and even offers her a bribe, but she holds firm. And then he dies.", "analysis": ""}
