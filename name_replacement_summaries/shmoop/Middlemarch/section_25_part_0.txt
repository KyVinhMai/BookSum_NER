His mother calls their usual surgeon, Mr. Wrench, who prescribes the wrong thing and then doesn't come back to check in on him. So Rosamond recommends that they call Mr. Lydgate , who immediately sees that it's typhoid fever . Lydgate doesn't want to step on any toes or annoy Mr. Wrench, so he tries to be nice about the fact that Wrench totally screwed up. Everyone in Middlemarch finds out about the matter, but they all hear different versions of the story. Some gossip is even getting spread that Lydgate is the illegitimate son of Mr. Bulstrode.", "analysis": ""}
