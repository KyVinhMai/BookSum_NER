Lydgate explains that it's very important for the town to have this new fever hospital, but, because it's being funded mostly by Bulstrode, a lot of prominent townspeople are against it - Bulstrode isn't popular in certain circles. And some of the other medical men are against it, because they disapprove of Lydgate's new-fangled scientific methods. Dorothea thinks that it all sounds very petty, and agrees to help fund the hospital. She likes helping people, and thinks that this will be a good way to do it.", "analysis": ""}
