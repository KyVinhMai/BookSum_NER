They feel sorrier for Mrs. Bulstrode than they do for her niece, Rosamond, though, because Mrs. Bulstrode has always been a cheerful, friendly woman, while Rosamond is kind of snooty. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bulstrode has no idea what's going on - her husband is sick, and no one will tell her what happened. Finally, she goes to her brother, Mr. Vincy, and he gives her the scoop on her husband. When she gets home, she locks herself in her room for a while, to get used to the idea of living in humiliation for the rest of her life. But she's not about to abandon her husband, now that he's publicly shamed; she's too loyal for that. Once she's calmer, she puts on a mourning dress , and goes to her husband. They have a good cry together, and make an unspoken agreement to stick it out as a team.", "analysis": ""}
