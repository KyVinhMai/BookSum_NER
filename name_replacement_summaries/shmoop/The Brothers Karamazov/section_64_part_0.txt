Together they head through the square to visit Ilyusha. It seems that since the rock throwing incident, Ilyusha has taken seriously ill. Moreover, he keeps calling for a dog named Zhuchka, which no one has been able to find. Since the incident, his classmates have started visiting him regularly, along with Alyosha Karamazov. Although Ilyusha has dearly wanted to see Kolya, Kolya has refused to visit him for the entire month until now. As the two boys cross the square, Kolya baits the peasants who are out selling their wares. Finally they arrive at Ilyusha's, but Kolya asks Smurov to go in and ask Alyosha to meet him outside", "analysis": ""}
