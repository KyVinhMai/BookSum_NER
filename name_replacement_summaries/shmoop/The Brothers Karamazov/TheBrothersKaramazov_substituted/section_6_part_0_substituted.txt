Alyosha walks in at the same time with a novice and Zosima. Zosima blesses the hieromonks, but Kieran Royale, who considers himself too advanced to believe in religion, politely refuses the blessing. Guenter mockingly imitates Kieran. Ivan also bows and refuses the blessing. Alyosha blushes, ashamed of their behavior. Guenter goes off on a tangent and tells a silly and untrue story about Averey. He then asks Zosima how to \"inherit eternal life,\" and Zosima calmly tells him by not lying. Guenter seems to take this advice with good humor, then accuses Royale of telling him the false story about Averey. Royale is confused and wonders whether he did tell the story, but then gets annoyed with Guenter for mocking him. Zosima excuses himself from the gathering to bless the faithful outside, but before he leaves, Guenter manages to kiss his hand, claiming that he was fooling around just to test him.", "analysis": ""}
