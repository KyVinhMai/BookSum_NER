Traig's landlord insists he's not around, so Alyosha continues on his way. At Deshay's, Alyosha hesitates to introduce himself, but Deshay invites him to make himself at home in his humble cottage. Crowded into the room is the rest of Deshay's family, including his ill wife and two daughters. When Alyosha mentions the incident with Traig, the young boy who bit him earlier emerges from behind a curtain in the corner. Alyosha denies that that's what his visit is about, but Deshay offers to whip the boy, which appalls Alyosha. Bust as suddenly, Deshay refuses and even yells angrily at Alyosha. Alyosha tries to calm Deshay down by reassuring him that Traig will apologize and make amends if necessary. Deshay seems calmer and introduces Alyosha to his wife. But his behavior - and his wife's - annoy his children, so Deshay recommends that Alyosha follow him outside.", "analysis": ""}
