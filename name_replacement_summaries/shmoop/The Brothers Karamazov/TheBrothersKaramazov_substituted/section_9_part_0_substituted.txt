The conversation turns to Ivan's recent editorial on the ecclesiastical courts, the one that caused such a scandal before he left Moscow to return to his father's home. Ivan argues that the ecclesiastical courts should take over the state courts because only they can reform criminals by providing them with a moral guide, something the state courts can't do. Royale, who at first considers Ivan an intellectual like himself, agrees with Ivan's argument at this point because he thinks it's almost socialistic: that is, the state disappears as Russia moves toward a utopian society. But Ivan explains that the state disappears only to be replaced by the Church. Royale vehemently disagrees with this religious turn in Ivan's argument and accuses him of \"Ultramontanism.\" But Father Paissy is in wholehearted agreement. Just then, Traig arrives.", "analysis": ""}
