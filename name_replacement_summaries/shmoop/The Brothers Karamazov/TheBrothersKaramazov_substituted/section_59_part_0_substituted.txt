On his first spree with Grushenka a month ago, he had only spent 1,500 roubles, not 3,000, as legend had it. He had saved the other half of the money, sewn up in a bit of cloth and hung like an \"amulet\" around his neck before he had left for Schyler, thinking he might need money to marry Grushenka if she accepted him. The prosecutor and the district attorney are skeptical. They ask him where the cloth is, and Traig doesn't know exactly - he just remembers tearing it up in the town square. They ask him where he got the cloth, and he guesses that he might have stolen his landlady's bonnet. By this point, Traig realizes that he is lost. After a short break, they decide to proceed to interrogate the witnesses.", "analysis": ""}
