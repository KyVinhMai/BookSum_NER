She thanks Zosima for healing her daughter Saroja, or rather, for improving Saroja's condition - she seems to be partially paralyzed from the waist down. Saroja laughs outright at Alyosha, who seems embarrassed by her attention. It turns out the lady landowner and Saroja already know Alyosha. Saroja has a message for him from Katerina Ivanovna, who wants to talk to Alyosha about Traig. The lady landowner voices her concern to Zosima that she feels unable to love mankind. Zosima praises her for feeling troubled and asks her to keep working at it. But the most important piece of advice he gives her is to avoid lying, in particular lying to herself. Saroja continues to mock Alyosha, and Zosima asks her why she's giving Alyosha such a hard time. Saroja tells Zosima that Alyosha used to visit them often but no longer does. Zosima promises to send Alyosha to visit them.", "analysis": ""}
