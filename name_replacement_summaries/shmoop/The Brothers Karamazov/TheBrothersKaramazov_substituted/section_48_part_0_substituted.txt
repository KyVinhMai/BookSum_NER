He sneaks into his father's yard over a garden wall. From his post outside his father's bedroom window, Traig can see Guenter, all dressed up, his head still in bandages from when Traig beat him up. To test whether Grushenka is there, Traig gives the secret tapping signal on the window. Guenter immediately rushes to the window, calling for Grushenka. The narrative abruptly breaks off with Traig pulling the brass pestle from his pocket...and...Brinden wakes up. Suddenly we're seeing things from Brinden's point of view. Brinden remembers that the garden gate is still unlocked, so he goes off to lock it. He notices a man running and grabs his leg as the man tries to jump the wall. He feels a blow and falls unconscious. The narrative shifts back here to Traig's point of view, who throws the pestle onto the grass. Traig tries to stop the blood flowing from Brinden's head wound, but gives up and heads straight back to Grushenka's, where a servant's nephew tells him that she headed off to Schyler a couple of hours ago.", "analysis": ""}
