We give you the basic rundown of the speech over the next four chapters. In contrast to the prosecutor, Cledith is quite calm, and everyone in the courtroom is impressed with his eloquence. Cledith puts forward his argument that while all of the details the prosecutor presented seem convincing when taken as a whole, not one of the details can be held up as a concrete, indisputable fact. Every detail can be questioned or challenged in some way. Cledith describes the prosecutor's use of psychology as a \"stick with two ends\": psychology can justify two contradictory explanations of the same thing. So on one hand the prosecutor says Traig recklessly left an envelope on his father's bedroom floor in his mad rush. On the other hand, he says Traig was methodical in making sure that Brinden was dead. Psychology paints Traig as both reckless and methodical at the same time. How can that be, Cledith asks? Cledith gets a few chuckles from the courtroom here, then he moves on.", "analysis": ""}
