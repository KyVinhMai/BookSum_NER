The famous doctor, who obviously thinks he is way too important to visit a poor family like the Deshays, condescendingly states that the only way the family can be saved is if they move - Ilyusha to Sicily, the daughter and the mother to the Caucasus, and the mother to Paris. His contempt angers Kolya, who threatens the doctor with an attack from PerezRennie, but Alyosha calms Kolya down. Kolya returns to the room and the doctor leaves in a huff. Deshay tries to reassure Ilyusha, but Ilyusha already knows that nothing can be done and that there's no cure. He pulls both Kolya and Deshay to his tiny, consumptive body in a hug. Everybody is crying at this point. He tells Deshay that when he dies - sniff - Deshay should find another boy to be friends with - sniff - and just please don't ever forget him - sniff - just visit his grave once in a while. Sob. Kolya can't fight the tears, so he leaves the room. Kolya heads home, and Alyosha leaves as well.", "analysis": ""}
