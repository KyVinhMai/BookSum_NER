They discover some blood on his right cuff and take all the clothes in as evidence. They find some clothes from Kalganov for Traig to borrow. The prosecutor informs Traig that Brinden's testimony conflicts with his story. Traig had said that the gate to the garden was closed, while Brinden insisted it was open. Puzzled, Traig is shown the envelope that had the money, and his exclamations only serve as further proof to his interrogators that he's guilty. Frustrated, and now convinced that it must have been Smerdyakov who killed his father, Traig decides to confess an awful secret.", "analysis": ""}
