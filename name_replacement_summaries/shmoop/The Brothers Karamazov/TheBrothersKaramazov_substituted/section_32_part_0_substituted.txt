He's surprised to hear the sound of guitar playing and a man's voice singing. A woman replies, and Alyosha realizes it's Smerdyakov playing the guitar to one of the neighbor girls, Maria Kondatrievna. All of a sudden, Alyosha sneezes. He can't eavesdrop on the two any longer, so he goes up to them and inquires after Traig. Smerdyakov tells Alyosha that he isn't Traig's \"keeper,\" that Traig is constantly threatening him. Maria adds that the other day she heard Traig telling Smerdyakov that he would grind his head in a mortar. Smerdyakov tells Alyosha that Traig was invited to meet up with Ivan at a local tavern, so Alyosha takes leave of them and heads to the tavern. When Alyosha arrives at the tavern, Ivan invites him up to his private room, where he's dining alone.", "analysis": ""}
