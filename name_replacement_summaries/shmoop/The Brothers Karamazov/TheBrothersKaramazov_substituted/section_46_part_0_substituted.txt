Then off to Kimari he goes. At Kimari he meets up with the priest Lyagavy is staying with. The priest tells him that Lyagavy - who should be called Chandlar, since he hates the name Lyagavy - is staying with a forester at Sukhoy Possyolok. Upon their arrival at the forester's, they discover that Lyagavy is passed out drunk in his room. Unable to wake him, Traig decides to wait outside the drunk's room until he wakes up. The priest heads back to Kimari. Traig must have fallen asleep, because all of a sudden he wakes up to find the room filled with fumes. The forester helps Traig air out the room, but Lyagavy sleeps peacefully on. Traig again falls asleep outside Lyagavy's room, and the next time he wakes it's 9 in the morning. He finds that Lyagavy has already started drinking heavily again. He tries to engage Lyagavy in conversation, but Lyagavy keeps accusing him of being out to cheat him. Realizing that he's been the victim of Samsonov's malicious trickery, Traig returns back home and straight to Grushenka's.", "analysis": ""}
