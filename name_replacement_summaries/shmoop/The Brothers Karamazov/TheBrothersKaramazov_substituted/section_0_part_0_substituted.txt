Instead of going straight to this juicy bit, though, the narrator decides to go into everything leading up to the death. So buckle your seatbelts, 'cause it's going to take him, oh, several hundred pages. We learn that Guenter is the scum of the earth who makes oodles of money and lives a scandalous lifestyle. He had his first son, Traig, by his first wife, Adelaida Ivanovna Royale, who came from an aristocratic family and was apparently quite a catch. No one is sure why she eloped with him in the first place, but she ended up abandoning him and their son to run off to Petersburg with a seminarian. She died before Guenter could chase her there. After her death, Guenter made a scene around town, drinking, sobbing, and shouting in the streets.", "analysis": ""}
