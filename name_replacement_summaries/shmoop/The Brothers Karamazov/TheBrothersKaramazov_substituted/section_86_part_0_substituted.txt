Declyn rejects the idea that Smerdyakov murdered Guenter, because there is no factual evidence. He paints Smerdyakov as essentially a coward, fearful of Traig's strength and Ivan's newfangled ideas, unable to muster enough guts to do something as extreme as murder. In his retelling of the events of that night, Declyn argues that there was no point at which Smerdyakov could have murdered Guenter. Then Declyn turns to Smerdyakov's suicide note and argues that the absence of any confession to Guenter's murder is further proof that Smerdyakov didn't do it. He asserts that if Smerdyakov had really confessed to Ivan the night before, as Ivan claimed, Ivan would have gone straight to the police instead of waiting for the trial. Declyn said he had information that Ivan had cashed two 5 percent bank notes for 5,000 roubles each a week ago. Declyn points to Katerina's letter as further evidence for his version of events. Just as the letter had stated, Traig had murdered and robbed his father, leaving the envelope containing the roubles on the floor. This is just how someone who murdered in a fit of passion would act, not caring about leaving key evidence behind. He also dismisses the idea that Traig could have checked on Brinden after he attacked him, because such an act of compassion isn't consistent with Traig's character.", "analysis": ""}
