Alyosha unexpectedly replies that he's just like Traig; it's just a matter of degree. Traig then tells Alyosha that he'd like to tell him about his tragedy, the details of which Ivan already knows. Back in his lieutenant days, Traig had some issues with his colonel. His colonel had had two wives, now deceased, and each wife had given him a daughter. The first daughter, Agafya, was already becoming a spinster at the ripe old age of 24. The second daughter, who happens to be the Katerina Ivanovna that so terrifies Alyosha, was bright and accomplished and quite the social star. While Agafya was on speaking terms with Traig, Katerina always treated him with cold contempt. Traig had just received a large sum of money from their father, Guenter, when he learned that there were financial irregularities with the way the colonel was handling government money. Traig pulled Agafya aside and told her that if the family ever needed money, he would lend it to them, but only if Katerina came by herself to his rooms to ask for the money. Agafya was shocked and dismissed Traig's comment. As it turns out, the colonel had been loaning the government's money to a friend of his, who usually repaid the money with interest. This time around, though, his friend had not repaid the money. On top of that, a new major was in town, asking questions. The colonel was just about to shoot himself when Agafya, sensing something was amiss and thinking of Traig's words, charged in and intervened. Traig says that he was just about to go out that night when the door opened, and who should it be but Katerina Ivanovna. When she asked for the money, Traig suddenly balked at the thought and pretended he was taking back the request. But just as suddenly, filled with intense hatred, he changed his mind and wrote her a check for the sum. She bowed deeply, with her forehead to the ground, and left.", "analysis": ""}
