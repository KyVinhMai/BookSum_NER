Alyosha and Saroja are alone, so Alyosha tells Saroja about his encounter with Deshay. He reveals that he's actually glad that Deshay rejected the money because it gave Deshay the chance to prove he was an honorable man. Alyosha decides that Deshay will be more receptive to the money the next day. Saroja then tells Alyosha that her note to him actually wasn't a joke at all. Alyosha tells her he knows, and Saroja is annoyed because he seems so cold. But then he kisses her, which surprises them both. He confesses that he had her letter in his pocket all along. Saroja asks Alyosha why he seems so terribly sad, and he mentions how troubled he is by his family's conflicts and Zosima's ill health. After kissing Saroja good-bye, Alyosha heads downstairs only to be headed off by Madame Khokhlakov, who is distressed by what she's overheard between him and Saroja. Alyosha refuses to show her Saroja's letter and continues out the door.", "analysis": ""}
