His mother's cousin, Kieran Alexandrovic Royale, happened to return from Paris a year later and rescued Traig. But then Kieran abandoned Traig to go to Paris, pawning him off onto his mother's cousin, who then died and passed Traig on to one of her daughters. Traig grew up, led an unruly life, went into the military, and spent way more money than he had. He came back to Guenter's to see what he could get of his inheritance left to him by his mother. Guenter started off by giving Traig some money from time to time over the course of four years. By the end of this time, Traig was impatient for the rest of his inheritance, but Guenter informed him there was no money left. Traig wasn't satisfied with this explanation and suspected a scam.", "analysis": ""}
