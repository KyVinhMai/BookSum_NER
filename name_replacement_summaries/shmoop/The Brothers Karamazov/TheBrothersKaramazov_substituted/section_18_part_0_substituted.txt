Here we're given a little background on Smerdyakov, Stinking Lizaveta's son. A quiet, sullen child, Smerdyakov was discovered to have the \"falling sickness\" ; he would fall into fits every month or so. For some reason Guenter grew quite fond of the boy after his illness was discovered. One day, Smerdyakov was found picking through his soup, and Guenter decided that Smerdyakov should be trained as a chef. After training in Moscow, Smerdyakov came back to be Guenter's cook. Now 24, he is just as sullen and silent as ever.", "analysis": ""}
