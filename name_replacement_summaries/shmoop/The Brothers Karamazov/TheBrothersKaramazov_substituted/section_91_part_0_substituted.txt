Even if he had, according to Cledith, it wouldn't even count as parricide because of what a miserable father Guenter was. Not only did Guenter's awful parenting result in the mess that Traig is today, but Guenter so completely abandoned his obligations as a father that he doesn't deserve to be called a father at all. Cledith then digresses into a general discussion of how the future of society depends on good fathers. Citing the Gospel, he asks the jury to have mercy on Traig and declare him innocent. By this show of mercy, they will be giving Traig a chance at redemption and at living a good life, a chance his father never gave him. Cledith is frequently interrupted by applause. He ends his speech not with a runaway troika, as Declyn did, but with the image of a magnificent Russian chariot.", "analysis": ""}
