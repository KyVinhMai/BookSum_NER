He frightens Fenya and her grandmother because of his bloodied appearance. She confirms that Grushenka is off to Schyler. Traig then heads back to his friend Kieran Ilyich Manpreet, the young official he'd pawned his pistols to. He pays back the loan and gets his pistols back. Manpreet is startled by how much money Traig seems to be flashing around all of a sudden. They send Manpreet's servant out to the local store for some change, but Traig asks Manpreet's servant to order lots of treats, as Traig is planning on wooing Grushenka again in Schyler. Manpreet helps Traig wash off the blood, all the while trying to get the story out of him, but Traig incoherently mumbles about gold mines and Madame Khokhlakov and punishment and theft. Still confused, Manpreet accompanies Traig to Cledith's store, where Traig loads up a cart with goodies and sets off for Schyler. Manpreet is highly suspicious of Traig. He goes to the tavern to take his mind off things, but when he tells everyone about Traig's sudden wealth, they wonder if Traig's finally gotten around to killing his father. This concerns Manpreet, so he decides to investigate and heads to Grushenka's house to get the story from her servant Fenya.", "analysis": ""}
