Alyosha tells Traig not to feel bad about trying to escape - after all, he is innocent. He admonishes Traig just to remember his promise to reform his ways and become a new man. Traig tells Alyosha about his plans to escape with Grushenka to America, learn English, and return to Russia disguised as an American. Suddenly Katerina appears in the doorway. She rushes to Traig and clasps his hands, and they seem to come to a reconciliation over everything that's happened between them. Although they are both involved with other people now, they promise to love each other forever. Katerina also affirms that she too believes in Traig's innocence; she only revealed his letter at the trial out of petty jealousy. As Katerina leaves, she encounters Grushenka and asks her forgiveness, which Grushenka will give only if Katerina pulls off Traig's escape. Alyosha follows Katerina out the door, then heads over to a funeral.", "analysis": ""}
