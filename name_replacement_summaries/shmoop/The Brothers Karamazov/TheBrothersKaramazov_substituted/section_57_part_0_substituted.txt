Traig insists that the gate to the garden was closed, while Parfenovich and Declyn insist that it was open. Traig then tells his interrogators about the secret signals that only he, Smerdyakov, his father, and Grushenka knew, the signals that would announce Grushenka's arrival to Guenter. Parfenovich suggests that Smerdyakov may have killed his father, but Traig rejects this possibility because he believes Smerdyakov is a weak-willed coward. The interrogators keep pestering Traig, even asking him to demonstrate exactly how he sat on the garden wall when Brinden accosted him. Traig tells them about getting his pistols back from Manpreet, his suicide plans, and even gives them the note he had shown to Manpreet in Book 8, Chapter 5. The interrogators go back to the question of the money. They estimate, given how much money they've found on Traig right now and the amount he spent on the festivities, that he had roughly 1,500 roubles on him, not 3,000. Traig refuses to tell them how he got the money or why he had claimed previously that he had 3,000 roubles. They then ask Traig to strip so they can search his possessions.", "analysis": ""}
