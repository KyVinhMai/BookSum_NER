When he arrives, he discovers that not only are all the important officials there, but they have also already been notified of Guenter Karamazov's murder by the servant Marfa Ignatievna. What happened was this: Marfa is woken up by a terrible scream from Smerdyakov, the kind that always began his epileptic fits. She notices Brinden is missing, then hears groaning from the garden, where she discovers a bloodied Brinden much as Traig left him in. She rouses her neighbor, Maria Kondratievna, her daughter, and the visiting Foma, and they all go to Guenter Karamazov's house, where they discover his dead body. Marfa then runs off to the deputy commissioner's. Manpreet, Makarov, and the other officials head over to Guenter Karamazov's house to investigate. After surveying the scene, they dispatch the deputy commissioner off to Schyler to keep watch on Traig while they get the paperwork settled for his arrest. This is why, when Traig had previously met Lovell Brookes outside , the innkeeper looked concerned - he had already been notified by the deputy commissioner of Traig's impending arrest.", "analysis": ""}
