Royale had just finished apologizing for Guenter's behavior when Guenter popped in. Guenter had been planning on skipping the lunch, having caused enough commotion already, but in his carriage he had changed his mind and decided he had a couple more tricks up his sleeve. Guenter at first accuses Maximov the landowner of being somebody else - some dude named Rennie Skylan who, according to Guenter, had died a grotesque death in a brothel. Next, Guenter attacks the Father Superior and the monastery in general. He accuses them of stealing the peasants' money and spending it on lavish spreads like the dinner they're about to enjoy. He also accuses them of turning his second wife, the \"shrieker\" against him. During these tirades, the Father Superior's only reaction is to thank Guenter for giving them all a dose of humility, which Guenter ignores. Royale can't stand Guenter's behavior anymore and leaves, followed by Kalganov. Guenter also leaves, demanding that Alyosha leave the monastery as well. Ivan follows Guenter. As they get into their carriage, the landowner Maximov comes running after, thinking that the real party's with Guenter. But Ivan pushes him away from the carriage and orders the driver to leave. In their carriage, Guenter tries to get Ivan to talk, but Ivan coldly ignores him.", "analysis": ""}
