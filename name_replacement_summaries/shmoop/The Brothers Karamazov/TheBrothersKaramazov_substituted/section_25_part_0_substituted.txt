Guenter goes off on a tirade about how everyone is evil; it's just that he lives his evil openly. Guenter then explains to Alyosha that the reason that he won't press charges against Traig is because he knows that would make Traig sympathetic in Grushenka's eyes. Guenter then remarks that Ivan's a cold fish who loves no one. He asks Alyosha to ask Traig if Traig would leave Grushenka alone for one or two thousand rubles. Alyosha hesitatingly agrees, but Guenter quickly takes the offer back spitefully. Alyosha gets up to leave and kisses his father goodbye. Guenter is surprised by the gesture and wonders if he'll see Alyosha again, but Alyosha reassures him that it's just a simple goodbye. After Alyosha leaves, Guenter goes to his bedroom to sleep.", "analysis": ""}
