Donne goes first. He testifies that he finds Traig to be of an \"abnormal\" state of mind. As confirmation, he oddly states that when Traig walked into the courtroom, he should have looked to the left where the women were sitting, since he has a thing for the ladies. Instead he looked straight ahead. That's a convincing argument . Next up is the famous doctor. He agrees with Dr. Donne that Traig is \"abnormal,\" but he adds that Traig has \"mania\" and is prone to act in a \"fit of passion.\" As if to one-up Donne, the famous doctor claims that Traig should have looked to the right when he walked into the courtroom, because that's where his defense attorney was sitting. Finally comes Dr. Varvinsky. He testifies that he believes Traig to be completely sane and that it was quite natural for him to look straight ahead as he walked, because that's where the judges were sitting. Traig loudly agrees with Dr. Varvinsky. Then Dr. Donne is called up again by the defense and surprises everyone with a sympathetic story about Traig. Donne remembers coming across Traig as a young child, neglected by his father. He had bought Traig a pound of nuts out of charity. Years later, when Traig returned to town as a young man, he visited Donne and reminded him of his kindness. Traig loudly insists again on his gratitude, and everyone in the court seems impressed.", "analysis": ""}
