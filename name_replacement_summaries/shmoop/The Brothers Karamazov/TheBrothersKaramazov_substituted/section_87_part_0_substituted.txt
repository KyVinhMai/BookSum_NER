Now you've made it through Chapters 6 through 8 and have finally arrived at the final part of the prosecutor's closing statement. Declyn describes the events at Schyler. He depicts Traig as someone who thought his world had ended and his romantic hopes were dashed until he arrived at Schyler. There, according to Declyn, he realized that he still had a chance with Grushenka. Reunited with her, his desire to live is rekindled. The reason the investigators found only 1,500 roubles on him is that he stashed the rest of the money in some secret hole at the inn. Declyn claims that Traig's desire to live fuels his absurd stories during his interrogation at Schyler. When confronted with the seemingly trivial but damning detail that the gate to his father's house was open, Traig desperately came up with the fiction of the amulet and Smerdyakov's murdering his father. Declyn then begs the jury to save Russia and convict Traig for the murder of his father. His speech over, Declyn leaves the courtroom immediately and nearly faints in the next room. The chapter ends with chatter in the courtroom during a brief, twenty-minute break, before the defense attorney begins his speech.", "analysis": ""}
