Everyone insists that she couldn't possibly have entered the house without their being aware of it. Guenter accuses Traig of stealing the money intended for Grushenka and rushes at him. Traig grabs Guenter by the hair, throws him to the floor, and kicks him. Ivan and Alyosha pull Traig away. Finally convinced that Grushenka isn't in the house, Traig runs off to look for her. As he leaves, he reminds Alyosha to go see Katerina. The servants help Guenter to bed and Ivan leaves to get some air in the yard. Alyosha goes to his father, who is still out of it from drink and the beating he got from Traig. Guenter tells Alyosha he can have his mother's icon and return to the monastery. He asks Alyosha to see Grushenka, but then takes back his request. He then asks Alyosha to visit him the next day. On his way out of the house, Alyosha sees Ivan, who says that he'll protect Guenter from Traig.", "analysis": ""}
