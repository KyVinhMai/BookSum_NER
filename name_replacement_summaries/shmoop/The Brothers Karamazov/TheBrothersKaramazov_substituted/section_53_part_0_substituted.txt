Here the servant Fenya tells Manpreet that Traig had arrived earlier, covered in blood, and had even confessed to killing a man. More concerned than ever, Manpreet starts to go to Guenter Karamazov's but decides against it because he fears causing a scandal just in case Guenter Karamazov was not murdered. Instead, he decides to ask Madame Khokhlakov what happened. Although it's late - 11 at night - Madame Khokhlakov is finally roused from her bed to receive Manpreet. She attests that she never lent Traig any money and even writes a short statement to that effect. Manpreet and Khokhlakov experience a mutual attraction, despite the extraordinary circumstances, and Manpreet goes on his way.", "analysis": ""}
