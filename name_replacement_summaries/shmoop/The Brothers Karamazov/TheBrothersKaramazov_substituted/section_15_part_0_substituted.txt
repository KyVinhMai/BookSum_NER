To get to Katerina's, he has to cut through his father's neighbors' garden. These neighbors are an old woman and her daughter, a former chambermaid used to working in grand homes. As Alyosha gets to the garden, he's astonished to see his brother Traig inside. Traig waves him over. Alyosha asks him why he's whispering, and Traig shouts out that he's got a secret. But Traig's voice quickly goes down to a whisper again as he asks Alyosha to follow him to a gazebo in the center of the garden. In the gazebo, Alyosha notices that Traig has been hitting the cognac pretty hard. Traig starts to ramble, spouting off a mixture of German and Russian poetry and proclaiming himself to be the lowest, basest sensualist - as only a Karamazov could be.", "analysis": ""}
