She tells him that she craves \"disorder,\" that she wants to suffer. She also tells him that Kalganov has even proposed to her. Saroja tells him that she has horrible dreams involving tiny devils infesting her closets. Alyosha admits that he has had the same dream. She also dreams that a - prepare yourself for ugly anti-Semitism here - Jew is torturing a small child while she eats pineapple compote.
