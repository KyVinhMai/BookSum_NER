Grushenka has to be pulled away from Traig. Traig is sat at a table, where Parfenovich and Declyn begin his interrogation. A clerk takes notes. Traig is relieved to learn that Brinden is OK, and he denies that he murdered Guenter. The officials remind him that he's been talking about murdering his father for the last month or so; that he's been loudly protesting that his father owes him his inheritance; and that Traig regarded the 3,000 roubles Guenter was saving for Grushenka as his own property. Traig concedes all these points, but he still denies murdering his father. His initial joy and relief at discovering that Brinden is still alive gives way to sadness at his father's death. Grushenka bursts in to interrupt the interrogation and she has to be taken to a different floor altogether. Makarovich explains to Traig that he calmed Grushenka down and placed her in the care of Maximov and the innkeeper's daughters. Traig is grateful.", "analysis": ""}
