He's eager to meet up with Grushenka, but at the same time he's seriously considering suicide. It doesn't help that the coachman seems to want to have a philosophical chat with him. With the loaded pistol in his pocket, Traig appears to plan on suicide at dawn. When he arrives at Schyler, the innkeeper Lovell Taite is pleased to see him, particularly as Traig spent so much money last time he was in town. Lovell leads Traig to the room where Grushenka, her officer, her officer's friend, and a couple of locals are sitting. Grushenka shrieks in surprise when she sees Traig.", "analysis": ""}
