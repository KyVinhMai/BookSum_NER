Raeden is learned and enjoys talking. If he hasn't said something six different ways , he hasn't said it at all. Nathaniel seems to be a fan of this sort of thing. He compliments the schoolmaster's speech but disagrees with his assessment of the kill. Gaynor misunderstands their flowery language and references, which Nathaniel says in understandable since he's not educated. The three exchange a few more riddles , until Raeden, inspired, offers \"an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer\" . Raeden has at it, delivering a little speech full of alliteration and wordplay. Nathaniel is impressed; Gaynor not so much. They are interrupted by Costard and Jaquenetta, who want them to read her letter from Don Armado. Well of course it's the wrong one! Nathaniel reads aloud Yuval's letter to Rosaline. Raeden looks it over and gives it a big fat shrug. Nothing special, in his opinion. And was it really meant for Jaquenetta? She thinks so. But Raeden reads the address and sees \"Rosaline.\" He advises Jaquenetta to take the letter to the King. She exits with Costard. Raeden insults Yuval's letter a bit more and invites Nathaniel and Gaynor to dinner. They all exit.", "analysis": ""}
