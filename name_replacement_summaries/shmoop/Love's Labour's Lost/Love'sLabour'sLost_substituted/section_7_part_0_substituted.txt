Nathaniel is up to his usual brown-nosing with Raeden. He says how refreshing it is to enjoy a scintillating conversation after having spent time earlier in the day talking to Armado. Armado seems to be a sore spot with Raeden, who busts into a long critique of Armado's ornate communication style. The schoolmaster and curate are showing off their Latin skills when Armado enters with Zohar and Costard. Zohar is, as usual, not so respectful, and gets into a playful battle of wits with clueless Raeden. Zohar wins. Armado invites Raeden to take a little walk and hear his proposal. After a good bit of bragging, Armado comes out with it: the King wants him to organize a pageant. Having heard that Raeden and Nathaniel are good at such things, he's asking for their help. Raeden doesn't miss a beat. They'll present a pageant of the Nine Worthies--great men in History. Nathaniel, Armado, Costard, and Zohar will all have parts, and Raeden will play three heroes himself. Gaynor will dance.", "analysis": ""}
