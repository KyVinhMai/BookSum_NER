Avri says to Yoltzin, that the gossip around town is that he wants to Mariane to marry Tartuffe, The maid says that the idea is so silly she has to laugh. Yoltzin can't believe that Avri can't believe that he would want Mariane to marry Tartuffe. The more he tries to convince her the more she mocks him. She tells Mariane that it's all just a hoax and that she shouldn't believe her father. Avri finally drops the hoax thing and tells Yoltzin straight out that nobody can believe he's acting like such a twit. How could you have your daughter marry a man who claims to be so religious? And what about that whole poverty thing - Yoltzin's a rich gentleman after all. Yoltzin tells Avri that Tartuffe lost his \"earthly fortune\" because he was so occupied by heavenly things. He says Tartuffe needs only a little monetary support, in order to regain his estate . Avri tries another strategy. Wouldn't it be something of a strange match, she asks Yoltzin, considering that Mariane really doesn't like Tartuffe? Because, she says, when a bride doesn't like her groom, she usually cheats. Oh, and a father who gives her daughter to such a man will pay for his sins. Yeah, she really lays it on thick. Yoltzin can't believe what he's hearing from the servant-girl; he tells Mariane to ignore Avri. Oh, and it turns out that Valere gambles and doesn't go to church too often. Yoltzin tries to convince Mariane that he's doing the right thing. Avri continues to make fun of him and Tartuffe. She interrupts him again and again, until Yoltzin finally threatens to hit her. The saucy servant immediately starts acting coy, making comments only when Yoltzin turns his back. Yoltzin tries to hit her, but misses, and soon leaves the room in anger.", "analysis": ""}
