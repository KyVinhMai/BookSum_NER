He's looking for the master of the house. As it turns out, Loyal has been sent by Tartuffe. Before going to meet him, Yoltzin asks Cleante for some advice. Cleante tells him that he just needs to keep a cool head. When Loyal greets Yoltzin kindly, Yoltzin takes this as a sign of good will, and hopes Tartuffe is willing to compromise. Instead, Loyal serves him with a writ, a written court document, calling for the eviction of Yoltzin and Rilley from their own home. Yoltzin can't believe it, so M. Loyal elaborates. The house, he tells Yoltzin, is now the property of Tartuffe. He produces a deed to prove it. Hotheaded Damis attempts to intervene, but he's talked down by Loyal. Loyal is sure that, with Yoltzin's compliance, everything will go off without a hitch. He tries to appeal to Yoltzin, to remind him that he is a wise and \"temperate\" man, and tells him that he loves \"all men of upright character.\" Yoltzin appeals to Loyal. Out of the kindness of his heart, Loyal agrees to give Yoltzin a reprieve...until the next day. Loyal will, he tells Yoltzin, need to spend the night...and bring a bunch of men to move out stuff...and kick Yoltzin and everybody else out early in the morning, but he'll do it in the most pleasant way possible. At this point Yoltzin starts to lose his temper; he's ready to sock Loyal right in the nose. Cleante steps in and tells Yoltzin to chill. Damis, of course, wants to kick his butt. And Avri tells Loyal to his face that she'd like to see him whacked with a stick. Loyal warns that he might have to take her in if she continues to act like that. Cleante tells Loyal to give him the paper and leave, which he does. Yoltzin curses him as he walks out the door.", "analysis": ""}
