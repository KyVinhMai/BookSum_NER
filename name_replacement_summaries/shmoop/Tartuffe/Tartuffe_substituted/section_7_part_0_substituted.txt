Mariane doesn't really have a good answer. She's just used to doing what she's told; she's done it for so long. Avri puts her on the spot. Do you love Valere, she asks, or don't you? Mariane is insulted for a bit, but then she tells Avri how much she loves, really loves Valere, She says she would rather kill herself than marry Tartuffe. Avri thinks this is just about the stupidest solution to the problem she can think of. She has no sympathy for that kind hopelessness. She tells Mariane to buck up. When Mariane agonizes over disobeying her father, Avri mocks her, telling her how great a husband Tartuffe will make for her, how much fun she'll have visiting her awful in-laws, etc. This is too much for Mariane to take; she falls into despair again. This time, Avri takes pity on her, and the two set about making a plan.", "analysis": ""}
