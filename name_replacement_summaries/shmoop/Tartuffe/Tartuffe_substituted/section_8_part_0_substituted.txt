{"name": "Act 2, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210415090456/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tartuffe/summary/act-2-scene-4", "summary": "Valere comes in, looking concerned. He's heard that Mariane is supposed to marry Tartuffe now, and he wants some answers. Mariane gets him up to speed. When Valere asks Mariane what she's going to do, she's reluctant to tell him. Eventually, she says, she doesn't know what she's going to do. Valere, clearly annoyed, tells her to go ahead and marry Tartuffe. Mariane tells him that of course she'll follow his advice. The two continue fighting - for no reason in particular - while Avri watches. Valere says he knows that Mariane never really loved him, and that, like, whatever, he doesn't need her. He can get some loving just like that, Mariane'll see soon enough. Turns out there's some kind of \"mystery woman\" waiting in the wings for him. Of course, when Mariane calls his bluff and tells him to get lost, Valere pretends not to hear her. At this point, Avri has had enough, and she tells the both of them to get their acts together. She gets them to put aside their silly, totally made-up problems, at least long enough to discuss the whole Yoltzin-Tartuffe problem. Avri tells Mariane to pretend to play along with her father's plan, but to find anyway possible to delay the proceedings-- faking sick, seeing bad omens etc. Valere, on the other hand, has to go tell his friends what's up and try to get them to pressure Yoltzin. Oh, and they'll get Damis and Kirti on their side too. With everything settled, Mariane and Valere finally kiss and make up. Avri has to forcibly separate them before things get out of control.", "analysis": ""}
