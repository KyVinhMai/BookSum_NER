Cleante is amazed at how quickly Tartuffe has bamboozled Madame Ashna. Avri agrees, but she's even more afraid of the way he's tricking Yoltzin. Though he was once a wise and prudent advisor to the king, he seems to have gone a bit soft in the noggin. Now, she says, he's obsessed with Tartuffe and ignores everyone else. Avri points out that Tartuffe has been growing rich and fat thanks to his ignorance - this is what we literary types call exposition.", "analysis": ""}
