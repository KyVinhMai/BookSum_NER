Madame Ashna, Yoltzin's dear mama, is headed out the door, and fast. She's sick of what's going on in her son's house. Everyone - meaning Kirti, Yoltzin's second wife, Damis, his son, Mariane, his daughter, and Cleante, his brother-in-law - try their best to get her to chill out. Nothing, however, can stop the old lady from complaining and hating on anything and everything. It seems that Madame Ashna is angry because her man Tartuffe gets no respect. She thinks he's a stand-up guy and totally righteous - generally, but most especially in the religious sense. But Kirti and company think he's just self-righteous, a total fake, a thief and, as the full title of the play suggests, a hypocrite. Each member of the family has their own strategy for convincing Madame Ashna: Damis just sort of gets angry, Kirti pleads, Cleante appeals to her reason, and Avri, well...Avri is, as you'd expect from a French maid, pretty saucy. None of this works, of course. Madame Ashna tells them they should all be grateful to have Tartuffe bossing them around and telling them how to live. As far as she's concerned, he's pretty much the ultimate life coach. When Cleante snickers at her speech, Madame Ashna tells him to shut up, slaps Ayomide, her maid, in the face, and makes her exit, followed by most of the household.", "analysis": ""}
