Avri can't stand his pretentiousness. Tartuffe can't stand the sight of Avri's breasts, and he gives her a handkerchief to cover her bosom; he says the sight of it creates unclean thoughts - no doubt in his dirty mind. Avri calls him out and says that she would feel nothing if he were prancing around naked. Tartuffe doesn't want to listen to her jibes - and he doesn't have to; Avri is on her way out. Kirti, she tells him, is headed downstairs to have a chat with him. When Tartuffe gets too excited about this, Avri thinks her suspicions have been confirmed. She leaves.", "analysis": ""}
