He's got even worse news for Yoltzin: he's headed to prison. Yoltzin curses Tartuffe and calls him a villain. Tartuffe pays no attention, saying that \"those who serve Heaven must expect abuse\" . He still hasn't given up his self-righteous act. Cleante and Avri insult Tartuffe, then Mariane, then Yoltzin again. He doesn't care; even when Yoltzin reminds him that he saved him from poverty, Tartuffe merely says that his \"first duty is to serve King.\" He would sacrifice his wife...family...friend...to serve him\" . Again, Kirti and Avri insult Tartuffe. Cleante asks him where this newfound patriotic zeal came from, and wonders how he \"could condescend\" to be the heir of a traitor. Tartuffe pays no attention to this; he sics the police officer on Yoltzin. Plot twist! The officer turns around and arrests...Tartuffe. Tartuffe is, of course, blown away. The office turns to Yoltzin and explains himself. The King, it seems, is a little more with it than Yoltzin; he saw right through Tartuffe's little scheme. He's the kind of guy that Cleante would love: he knows true piety when he sees it, he's wise, and he has experience foiling these kind of liars. Oh, and as it turns out, this isn't the first time Tartuffe has tried to swindle someone; he's got a long criminal record, long enough to fill \"ten volumes and be writing still\" . He's a bad, bad, bad dude. The officer gives Yoltzin back the papers from the strongbox, and declares that the deed Tartuffe had written up is invalid. The King also pardons Yoltzin for hiding the papers, on account of his loyal deeds in the late civil war. Yoltzin a war hero? Whodathunkit? Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and praises the Lord. Except for Yoltzin. He begins to chew out Tartuffe, but luckily Cleante intervenes before he can say anything too stupid. He reminds Yoltzin that Tartuffe is already going to suffer for what he's done. Hopefully, he says, Tartuffe can actually find God, become a good person, and maybe get out on parole. You'd be better off, he tells Yoltzin, thanking the King for his kindness. And so Yoltzin lets bygones be bygones and gets ready to go see the King. Once that's been done, he says, we can finally get Mariane and Valere married. And they all lived happily ever after.", "analysis": ""}
