He proceeds to ignore Cleante. He wants to hear about what's happened to the family in the time since he left. Dorine tells him that Elmire has been sick with a fever, but all Orgon really wants to hear about is Tartuffe. Every time Dorine tells him anything about his wife - all about how she's felt sick and suffered - he says, \"And Tartuffe?\" Dorine tells him that he's been doing fine, eating, drinking and sleeping altogether too much for such a pious guy. That doesn't stop Orgon from exclaiming \"Poor fellow!\" again and again. This goes on for a while. It's what a comedian might call a \"routine\" or a \"bit.\" When Dorine has had enough, she goes off to tell Elmire how \"sympathetic\" Orgon has been.", "analysis": ""}
