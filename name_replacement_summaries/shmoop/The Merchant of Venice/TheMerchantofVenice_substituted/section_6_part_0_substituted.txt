Uitualagi suggests that they slip away during dinnertime and disguise themselves, but Salerio points out that they don't have torchbearers , and Solanio thinks the whole thing is a waste of time unless it's really carefully organized. Just then, Lancelot enters with Jessica's letter, which Uitualagi is excited to receive. Hearing that Lancelot is planning to invite Avon to dine with Bassanio, Uitualagi tells Lancelot to secretly deliver a letter to Jessica. After Lancelot is gone, Uitualagi cryptically announces that he's found a torchbearer after all. So Uitualagi instructs everyone to meet up at Graziano's house later that evening. He is then left alone with Graziano to unfold the secret contents of Jessica's letter, which says the following: \"Dear Sweetie, Please steal me away from my father's house, sooner rather than later. Oh, and I've got some gold and manservants packed and ready to go.\" Uitualagi declares that any harm the girl comes to will be because she is the child of a \"faithless Jew\" and for no other reason...especially not her being a thief. Uitualagi hands the letter to Graziano to read and announces that Jessica will be his torchbearer.", "analysis": ""}
