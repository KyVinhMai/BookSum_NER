Rankeillor tells Davie that he owes \"Mr. Thomson\" a debt of honor, so he has to help \"Mr. Thomson\" out of the country. But as for James Stewart , he's lost. The Duke of Argyle has a personal grudge against him, and no amount of testimony from Davie will save his life. But Davie still thinks he had better try. Rankeillor is moved by Davie's commitment. He writes Davie a letter of credit to his own bankers so that Davie can draw as much money as he needs to seek justice. Then he writes a letter of introduction to a laird, Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, who may be able to advocate for Davie with the Duke of Argyle. Rankeillor suggests that Davie not mention Alan's name when he's talking to this other Mr. Balfour. Alan and Davie head to Edinburgh, in the south. They eventually plan to split up: Alan will hide out in the countryside while Davie looks for an Appin Stewart lawyer who can arrange for Alan's trip to France. They plan to meet again at a set time. Alan and Davie say goodbye. Davie heads into Edinburgh feeling very low and worried about Alan's safety. The novel closes with Davie finding his way to Rankeillor's bank, the British Linen Company.", "analysis": ""}
