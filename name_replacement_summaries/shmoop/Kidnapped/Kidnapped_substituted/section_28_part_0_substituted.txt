Alan calls up that he's here to speak to Shakobe about Davie. Shakobe says he'll let Alan in. Alan says he has no plans to enter Shakobe's house. He wants to have this conversation on the man's doorstep. Shakobe comes downstairs to talk to Alan. Alan tells Shakobe that his own story is of no consequence, but that he has friends currently living near the island of Mull. Alan lies to Shakobe and says that his friends took Davie in after the wreck of the Covenant and spent a lot of money on him. Now they've come to collect silver for his return. Shakobe says Davie isn't worth much, and he doesn't plan to pay his debts. Alan warns Shakobe that, if his friends learn that Shakobe isn't going to fork over some money for Davie, they'll toss him out. Shakobe doesn't care. Alan argues that he had imagined two possibilities: either Shakobe loves Davie and would pay to have Davie back, or Shakobe hates Davie, and would pay Alan's friends to keep him away. To be clearer, Alan asks Shakobe point blank: \"what do ye want done with him, and how much will ye pay?\" . Will Shakobe pay to have Davie kept a prisoner, or will he pay to have Davie killed? Finally, Shakobe says he'll pay to have Davie kept - after all, Davie is his nephew. Alan then asks how much Shakobe paid Hoseason to take Davie. Shakobe's freaked out that Alan knows Hoseason, and Alan claims that they're partners in this thing. Shakobe exclaims that anything Hoseason says is a giant lie. Davie wasn't kidnapped! But, well, it is true that Shakobe gave Hoseason twenty pounds, and that Hoseason was to have the profits of Davie's sale in the Carolinas. At this, Rankeillor steps out of his hiding place, along with Davie and Torrance. Shakobe is in such shock at seeing these people that he doesn't protest when Alan takes away his gun. Torrance, Alan, and Davie settle in for supper and wine in Shakobe's kitchen while Rankeillor goes off to talk seriously with Shakobe about his fate. In the end, Davie and Shakobe agree that Shakobe will pay Davie two thirds of the income that comes from the Shaws tenants. So all's well that ends well.", "analysis": ""}
