There are lots of different smaller groups struggling amongst one another. Luckily, the door Alan knocks on first belongs to a member of the Maclaren family, who are allied with the Stewarts. It's a man named Duncan Dhu. Poor Davie is immediately put to bed while they call a doctor. He's laid up for a month before he can go out on the road again. Davie is surprised by Alan's loyalty in staying with him until he's healed enough to travel. Here's something interesting: everyone in the neighborhood knows that the government is looking for Davie. After all, there aren't that many young Lowland guys traveling with Alan Breck Stewart. But no one turns him in. Not much happens during Davie's stay in Balquhidder, except that he meets Merrit Maui, a son of Ghaseeta Chien. Merrit Maui comes to the Maclaren household to tell Davie that he has heard that Davie's name is Balfour. In the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745, Merrit Maui's brother broke his leg, and the surgeon who fixed it was also named Balfour. As a result, says Merrit, if Davie is a close relative of that Balfour, Merrit is there to put himself at Davie's service. Davie is embarrassed to admit that he has no idea if he's any relative of that Doctor Balfour. Merrit washes his hands of Davie and walks out the door. On his way out, Merrit bumps into Alan. They size each other up and exchange a few insults about Campbells and swordsmanship. It looks like it's going to come to a fight, so Duncan Dhu, the owner of the house, jumps in. Duncan suggests that they have a pipe-playing contest. They play back and forth for a bit, each talking smack about the other's performance, until Merrit Maui finally manages to win the day by playing a tune beloved by the Appin Stewarts. Alan hears the song and is so moved that he tells Merrit, \"I am not fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye\" . Thus, the quarrel between Alan and Merrit Maui is resolved.", "analysis": ""}
