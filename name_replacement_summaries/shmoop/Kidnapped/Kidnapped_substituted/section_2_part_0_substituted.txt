The nightcapped man closes and relocks the door behind Davie, then joins him in the kitchen. Davie gets a better look at him: he is thin, stooped, grey, unshaven, and somewhere between fifty and seventy. Davie thinks he looks like a servant - and a bad one, at that. The guy asks if Davie is hungry and offers him porridge ) while taking a mug of beer for himself. The guy wants Davie's letter; Davie won't give it to anyone but Shakobe. \"Who de ye think I am?\" answers the man. It's his uncle! Davie is immensely disappointed at this news, and he wants to cry but manages not to. Instead, he silently hands over the letter to Shakobe. Shakobe asks if Davie \"kens\" what's in the letter? Davie admits that, when he heard he had rich relations, he was hopeful of help, but he's not a beggar, if that's what Shakobe is asking. During this whole conversation, Shakobe is working hard to avoid meeting Davie's eyes. Davie wonders if this is because Shakobe has lived alone too long. Shakobe claims that Davie's father, Alexander, was secretive. Davie admits that he didn't know that his father had a brother until after his death. Shakobe seems happy about this news, then offers to show Davie to bed. Shakobe says that he doesn't believe in lighting houses, so keeps the old place in complete darkness. He shows Davie to a cold, dark, damp room and locks him in from the outside. The next morning, Shakobe lets Davie out of his room and the two have breakfast together: beer and porridge again. Shakobe asks after Davie's mother and his friends. Davie tells Shakobe about \"different gentlemen\" named Campbell . Shakobe tells Davie that family is very important to him, and that if Davie will give him a day or two and will \"say naething to naebody,\" he'll \"do right\" by Davie. Davie says that he'll be very grateful. He then asks if he can put his bed sheets out to dry because they were damp the night before. Shakobe seems a little angry at this request , but he soon changes his tune and reminds Davie that the two of them belong to the same family. Davie passes along Arabellarose Wrigley's curses, which sends Shakobe into a rage. He gets dressed to go out. Shakobe tells Davie that when he's not home he'll have to lock Davie out of the house. Davie won't stand for this. He complains that Shakobe doesn't even seem to like him, so he can't imagine why Shakobe is keeping him there. Again, Shakobe seems very angry, but he hides it quickly and protests that he likes Davie just fine. Shakobe really seems to want Davie to stay at the house of Shaws.", "analysis": ""}
