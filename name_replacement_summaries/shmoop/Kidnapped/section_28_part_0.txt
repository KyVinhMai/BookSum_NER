{"name": "Chapter 29", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422032710/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/kidnapped/summary/chapter-29", "summary": "Alan knocks violently on the door until Ebenezer appears from the upstairs window holding his blunderbuss, just as he did when Davie first arrived. Alan calls up that he's here to speak to Ebenezer about Davie. Ebenezer says he'll let Alan in. Alan says he has no plans to enter Ebenezer's house. He wants to have this conversation on the man's doorstep. Ebenezer comes downstairs to talk to Alan. Alan tells Ebenezer that his own story is of no consequence, but that he has friends currently living near the island of Mull. Alan lies to Ebenezer and says that his friends took Davie in after the wreck of the Covenant and spent a lot of money on him. Now they've come to collect silver for his return. Ebenezer says Davie isn't worth much, and he doesn't plan to pay his debts. Alan warns Ebenezer that, if his friends learn that Ebenezer isn't going to fork over some money for Davie, they'll toss him out. Ebenezer doesn't care. Alan argues that he had imagined two possibilities: either Ebenezer loves Davie and would pay to have Davie back, or Ebenezer hates Davie, and would pay Alan's friends to keep him away. To be clearer, Alan asks Ebenezer point blank: \"what do ye want done with him, and how much will ye pay?\" . Will Ebenezer pay to have Davie kept a prisoner, or will he pay to have Davie killed? Finally, Ebenezer says he'll pay to have Davie kept - after all, Davie is his nephew. Alan then asks how much Ebenezer paid Hoseason to take Davie. Ebenezer's freaked out that Alan knows Hoseason, and Alan claims that they're partners in this thing. Ebenezer exclaims that anything Hoseason says is a giant lie. Davie wasn't kidnapped! But, well, it is true that Ebenezer gave Hoseason twenty pounds, and that Hoseason was to have the profits of Davie's sale in the Carolinas. At this, Rankeillor steps out of his hiding place, along with Davie and Torrance. Ebenezer is in such shock at seeing these people that he doesn't protest when Alan takes away his gun. Torrance, Alan, and Davie settle in for supper and wine in Ebenezer's kitchen while Rankeillor goes off to talk seriously with Ebenezer about his fate. In the end, Davie and Ebenezer agree that Ebenezer will pay Davie two thirds of the income that comes from the Shaws tenants. So all's well that ends well.", "analysis": ""}
