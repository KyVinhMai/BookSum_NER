At Marheyo's, for instance, the whole household gathers to chant before bed, drumming with sticks. While the women are melodic, the men are more guttural. One night, Tommo sings an old folk song at the Ti, and Mehevi and the others are astounded by his voice, which is notable for its melody by Typee standards. After this, Mehevi often calls upon Tommo to sing, and also to shadow box with an invisible opponent, for his own delight. Walking by the lake one day, Tommo sees a mother dipping her infant into a stream, acclimating it to the water, teaching it to swim over several weeks. Tommo then goes on to talk about how Typee gals do their hair.", "analysis": ""}
