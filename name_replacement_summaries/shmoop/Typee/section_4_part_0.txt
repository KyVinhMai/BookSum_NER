He decides that, if he can get to the mountains and stay with the kind Happars, he can watch his ship sail off, then return to the coast and catch a ride on a different boat home. All he needs to do is avoid those fearsome Typees. Tommo is planning on leaving alone, and in secret, but as he's hanging out with his shipmate Toby one night, it becomes obvious that Toby is also unhappy on the ship. Tommo decides to tell him the plan, and invite him along. Within an hour, Toby has taken up the escape planning and the two friends spend the next day gathering information.", "analysis": ""}
