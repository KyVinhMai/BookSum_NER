Then they eat a morning meal and smoke a pipe. Post-breakfast there are naps or minor chores, after which Tommo heads to the Ti to eat with Mehevi. After, Tommo sails around the lake with Fayaway, or goes swimming, then watches the young women dance. At last, he returns to the house of Marheyo, to eat a bit, smoke a bit, and go back to sleep. It sounds like a real grind.", "analysis": ""}
