Next comes a warrior in full finery, covered with tattoos. It is only after a moment that they recognize him at Mehevi, their new chief pal from the night before. They discuss, as best they can, their own home customs, and all of the business with the Nukuheva and the French. Mehevi notices Tommo's leg and sends for a healer, who gives Tommo a sort of overly-aggressive massage, plus some leaf-based bandages, and then leaves him to rest. Tommo is introduced to a young man named Kory-Kory, who will be his manservant. After Mehevi leaves, around sunset, it becomes clear that Tommo and Toby are staying in a household with ten or twelve residents, including Kory-Kory. Tommo describes the building, which is made of coconut tree trunks, reeds, and branches, with sacks hanging from the beams for what seems like storage. Along with Kory-Kory, the household includes his father, Marheyo , his mother Tinor , and a collection of young men and women . One resident of the house is Fayaway, a young woman with whom Tommo becomes quickly transfixed, spending lots of real estate on the page regarding the beauty of her face, form, dress, and presence.", "analysis": ""}
