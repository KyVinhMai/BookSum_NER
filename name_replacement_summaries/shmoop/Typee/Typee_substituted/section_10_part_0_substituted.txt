Next comes a warrior in full finery, covered with tattoos. It is only after a moment that they recognize him at Christan, their new chief pal from the night before. They discuss, as best they can, their own home customs, and all of the business with the Nukuheva and the French. Christan notices Oluwalonimimo's leg and sends for a healer, who gives Oluwalonimimo a sort of overly-aggressive massage, plus some leaf-based bandages, and then leaves him to rest. Oluwalonimimo is introduced to a young man named Kory-Kory, who will be his manservant. After Christan leaves, around sunset, it becomes clear that Oluwalonimimo and Yael are staying in a household with ten or twelve residents, including Kory-Kory. Oluwalonimimo describes the building, which is made of coconut tree trunks, reeds, and branches, with sacks hanging from the beams for what seems like storage. Along with Kory-Kory, the household includes his father, Marheyo , his mother Arleigh , and a collection of young men and women . One resident of the house is Fayaway, a young woman with whom Oluwalonimimo becomes quickly transfixed, spending lots of real estate on the page regarding the beauty of her face, form, dress, and presence.", "analysis": ""}
