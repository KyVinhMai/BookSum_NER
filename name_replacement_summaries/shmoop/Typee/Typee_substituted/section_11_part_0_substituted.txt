In the morning, Oluwalonimimo wakes to find Kory-Kory on one side of him and Yael on the other. All feel refreshed, and Kory-Kory leads the two men to the stream so that they may bathe. Afterward, Christan visits once again, inviting Oluwalonimimo and Yael to walk with him , through the village and to Hoolah Hoolah--a sacred ground where no females may pass. Oluwalonimimo takes time to describe the grounds, with structures and verandas laid with mats, and four or five ancient tribesmen with tattoos so thick their skin is entirely one inky color. Inside a house, the Ti, they smoke a pipe with Christan and nap. Oluwalonimimo wakes to find that only he and Yael are left, and that it's dark. Outside, however, tribesmen are dancing around a fire. Oluwalonimimo and Yael worry and joke that this is the night they'll be eaten. The men implore them to eat what Oluwalonimimo understands to be \"baked baby\" but happily, it is a baby pig. They next morning, they return to Marheyo's hut without having been eaten--good times.", "analysis": ""}
