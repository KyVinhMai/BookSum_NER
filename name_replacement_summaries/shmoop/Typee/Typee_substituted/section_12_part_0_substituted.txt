Oluwalonimimo's leg is getting worse, and it's clear that they'll have to go for help to procure some western medicine. He asks Yael if he'll go for help in Nukuheva, perhaps coming back by boat, and Yael accepts, despite having reservations. Kory-Kory and the other villagers object loudly once they understand what Yael is planning to do, but Oluwalonimimo gestures to his worsening leg, and they agree that Yael will leave the following morning. Yael says goodbye, and Marheyo escorts him for a couple hours, returning once he's well on his way. Around noon, Oluwalonimimo hears great shouts coming from outside the hut, and discovers that something has happened to Yael. The girls wail, \"Awha! Awha! Yael mukee moee\" . Yael's body is carried into the village, his head having sustained a great blow. Oluwalonimimo checks for a heartbeat and finds one, happily, then cleans the wound. Soon after, Yael wakes. It turns out that Yael had encountered the Happars, and ran to greet them happily--not realizing what it would mean that he was coming from the Emari valley. Bad idea, Yael. The Happar struck him, and Yael fled back down into the valley. It becomes clear, after this, that it will be more difficult to leave the Emari than they had previously thought. On top of this, the Emari seem to use this as proof that the two men should stay in the valley.", "analysis": ""}
