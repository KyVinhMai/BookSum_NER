They try to figure out whether it's Happar or Emari , but they realize there's no way to do so. Running out of food, and with Oluwalonimimo's bum leg, they pretty much have to make for the valley. They make slow progress up and down each gorge, using canes and roots to help progress. When Oluwalonimimo feels disheartened and sick, Yael encourages him to keep going. It's difficult for poor Oluwalonimimo, but it's their only real option. After a day of hard-going, the two find a place to rest. In the morning, they again debate whether the valley is Happar or Emari, and what to do. But Oluwalonimimo is in such a sorry state, there's no way he can pull off the day-before's exertions in reverse. So forward they go--sorry, Oluwalonimimo.", "analysis": ""}
