{"name": "Chapter 16", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024203607/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/typee/summary/chapter-16", "summary": "Even though Oluwalonimimo is experiencing kindness at the hands of the Emari, he's still suspicious over Yael's disappearance and the idea that these people may be cannibals. More pressing is the condition of Oluwalonimimo's leg, which isn't getting better at all. One day, as Oluwalonimimo is resting in the Ti with Christan, he hears that there are boats approaching from the distance. He hopes Yael will return to rescue him. When he rises, thinking he will try to make it to the shore, Christan tells him quite sternly to sit down. Oluwalonimimo understands that he is truly captive--bummer. Oluwalonimimo also understands that most of the time, the Emari have much more information than they're willing to let on. There are exceptions, however, such as when Oluwalonimimo wows Marheyo with the magic technology of a sewing needle, or when he uses his straight razor to help the great warrior Narmonee, to better shave his head.", "analysis": ""}
