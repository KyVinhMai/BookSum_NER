The water tastes, he says, like a bunch of different terrible things all in one, but the Emari seem to use it as a sort of medicine. Coming back from the spring one day, Oluwalonimimo discovers a large rock terrace set into the side of a high hill, made up of several large rocks, something like the side of a pyramid. These have been here since the beginning of history, Kory-Kory later explains. Oluwalonimimo finds this discovery interesting, and wonders about the full human history of the Marquesas as a result. Each of the huts in which the Emari dwelt sat on a large stone foundation, and these too appear to have predated the Emari.", "analysis": ""}
