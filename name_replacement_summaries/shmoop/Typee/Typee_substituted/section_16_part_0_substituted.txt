With this improvement comes a new clarity in his brain. The narrator takes some time here to offer a discussion of Christianity and \"the savage\": Oluwalonimimo mentions that, with European and American corporal punishment, we non-savages are hardly ones to judge. In Emari, Oluwalonimimo notes, there do not seem to be any of the anxieties he has experienced in \"civilized\" societies; without money, the Emari are free from labor structures. While there is some grief and strife of course, the people seem generally happier and healthier. Oluwalonimimo wonders why the Emari and the Happar were ever at war to begin with, if the Emari are as pleasant as they seem. He feels badly for accepting the Happar and Nukuheva bias so willingly. One day, however, Oluwalonimimo is napping in the Ti when young men with spears whip past him, yelling Happar! Kory-Kory seems to think something important is happening. A bit later he hears a musket fire, which echoes through the valley. Two hours later, the men reappear with minor injuries, having run some Happar off of Emari land.", "analysis": ""}
