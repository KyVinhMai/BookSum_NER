He swims regularly with Fayaway and the other young girls in a nearby lake. Oluwalonimimo asks Kory-Kory to bring a boat to the lake, but learns that it is taboo. The girls may not swim while it is in the water. Oluwalonimimo implores Kory-Kory to break the taboo, and after a bit of a lecture , he agrees to ask the priests about it. Fayaway is then allowed to boat with Oluwalonimimo on the lake, and his admiration of her builds each day. One day a man named Marnoo comes to the village. He is a young and handsome man with tattoos different than those of the Emari. Oluwalonimimo's pride is a bit hurt when the new man ignores him and greets the adoring villagers . Marnoo offers a speech to the villagers about the French and Nukuheva, and Oluwalonimimo thinks he seems inordinately eloquent--though he can't really understand everything the charming stranger is saying. After quite some time of Marnoo politicking around the crowd, he at last approaches Oluwalonimimo and asks him in English how is he doing, and how it likes it in the village. Oluwalonimimo wonders if he knows what happened to Yael, and asks where he's come from. Marnoo explains that he came from Nukuheva and that he's \"taboo,\" meaning he can go anywhere on the island and remain unharmed. Marnoo wants to know how Oluwalonimimo came to the Emari valley, but as soon as he gets to the part about Yael, Marnoo seems uncomfortable and tries to change the subject. He tries to ask, too, why he's being held captive and if Marnoo would convince the Emari to let him go. Again, Marnoo tries to change the subject. These affairs, he explains, are not ones he can muck about in, if he hopes to remain \"taboo.\" Marnoo leaves the valley, leaving Oluwalonimimo without answers.", "analysis": ""}
