A feast is laid out for all, and the Emari drape themselves around, eating and smoking and celebrating. Here, Oluwalonimimo explains a native root called \"arva,\" which is used as a stimulant. Both Christan and Kory-Kory present Oluwalonimimo special foods. On the second day of the festival, the villagers gather to watch bereaved widows enact a ritual, and then Oluwalonimimo goes onto Hoolah Hoolah ground to listen to drummers and chanters. Oluwalonimimo tries to ask again about the significance of the festival, but he and Kory-Kory can't understand each other very well. The festival goes on for three days.", "analysis": ""}
