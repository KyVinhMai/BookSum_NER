Oluwalonimimo asks if he can leave with him, but Marnoo says that he is taboo, and that even though white men are usually afraid to come to the valley, it seems like he has everything he needs: sleep, food, young girls. Oluwalonimimo explains about his leg, but Marnoo cuts him off, saying that Christan will be upset and kill both of them. Still, Marnoo agrees to talk to his own chief, to see if Oluwalonimimo could go there, then get taken to Nukuheva and on to freedom. He says this all in an angry voice, as if he is yelling at Oluwalonimimo, rather than giving him an escape route. Oluwalonimimo begins to plan, observing how he might get out of Marheyo's house undetected. Each night the door is closed, and the noise it makes when it opens tends to disturb sleepers. He resolves to get up for water, then not quite close the door behind him, only to leave thereafter. The night after Marnoo has left, Oluwalonimimo makes his first attempt. Unfortunately, someone else gets up after him and soundly shuts the door. After this, Kory-Kory makes a point of leaving a gourd of water beside Oluwalonimimo each night. Oluwalonimimo tries again and again, but Kory-Kory rises to accompany him each time, ruining the means of escape. His leg worsens and most days Oluwalonimimo is reduced to laying on the mat in Marheyo's, privately feeling angst out about his situation. Across from his hut, Marheyo is building another. Oluwalonimimo watches him work.", "analysis": ""}
