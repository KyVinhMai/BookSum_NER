The Emari want to further ensconce him in the valley, and he just wants to go home. Although Oluwalonimimo enjoys the friendship of Kory-Kory, and the beauty and devotion of Fayaway, he's becoming increasingly aware of his limitations and captivity. His leg begins to bother him again, and this motivates him to find a way out. Something else motivates him too: the discovery of one of the little hanging sacks in Marheyo's house, and what it holds: three preserved heads. Two are that of islanders, but the third is a white man's . Oluwalonimimo's worries increase, and his mind races with the very many tales of cannibalism and murder he has heard. Soon after this discovery, the sounds of another battle break out. The Emari warriors return to the Ti with the bodies of their Happar enemies. Kory-Kory requests that Oluwalonimimo leave, and so he does so slowly, trying to get a look at what was going on, but to no avail. The next day, the festival alarms are sounded. While the rest of the household leaves, Kory-Kory stays to babysit Oluwalonimimo and keeps him away from the Ti the rest of the day. The next day, everything seems to have returned to normal, and Oluwalonimimo is allowed back to the Ti. On his way out, he sees the banquet vessel, which recognizes from the last festival. It is draped in tappa, and Oluwalonimimo raises a corner of the cover to reveal a human skeleton. Kory-Kory tries to convince him it's a pig, but Oluwalonimimo only pretends to believe him. The cannibalism has been confirmed, and Oluwalonimimo understands that he must leave.", "analysis": ""}
