He decides that, if he can get to the mountains and stay with the kind Happars, he can watch his ship sail off, then return to the coast and catch a ride on a different boat home. All he needs to do is avoid those fearsome Emaris. Oluwalonimimo is planning on leaving alone, and in secret, but as he's hanging out with his shipmate Yael one night, it becomes obvious that Yael is also unhappy on the ship. Oluwalonimimo decides to tell him the plan, and invite him along. Within an hour, Yael has taken up the escape planning and the two friends spend the next day gathering information.", "analysis": ""}
