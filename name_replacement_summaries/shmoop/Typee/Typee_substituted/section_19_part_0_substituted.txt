Then they eat a morning meal and smoke a pipe. Post-breakfast there are naps or minor chores, after which Oluwalonimimo heads to the Ti to eat with Christan. After, Oluwalonimimo sails around the lake with Fayaway, or goes swimming, then watches the young women dance. At last, he returns to the house of Marheyo, to eat a bit, smoke a bit, and go back to sleep. It sounds like a real grind.", "analysis": ""}
