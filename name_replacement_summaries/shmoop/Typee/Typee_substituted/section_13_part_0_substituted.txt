He's mostly restricted to laying on the mat in Marheyo and Arleigh's crib. Outside, the villagers cry \"botee! botee!\" and Oluwalonimimo watches women and men and children harvesting and carrying fruits in baskets to the shore, to an arriving boat. Kory-Kory refuses to carry Oluwalonimimo to the boat, but Yael resolves to go alone in order to come back and rescue him. Oluwalonimimo shakes his hand au revoir, and watches the parade of villagers pass him by. By sunset the villagers begin to return in small groups, but there's no sign of Yael and the villagers are avoiding answering any of Oluwalonimimo's questions. He finds Fayaway, who seems sympathetic, but she won't answer his questions either. Unsure of Yael's fate--whether he's escaped never to return, or is lying dead in a ditch somewhere--Oluwalonimimo continues his daily life in the village, bathing, sitting by Fayaway, watching the young lovelies of the Emari swim in the stream, and smoking a pipe with Christan. We can think of worse situations to be stranded in.", "analysis": ""}
