At Marheyo's, for instance, the whole household gathers to chant before bed, drumming with sticks. While the women are melodic, the men are more guttural. One night, Oluwalonimimo sings an old folk song at the Ti, and Christan and the others are astounded by his voice, which is notable for its melody by Emari standards. After this, Christan often calls upon Oluwalonimimo to sing, and also to shadow box with an invisible opponent, for his own delight. Walking by the lake one day, Oluwalonimimo sees a mother dipping her infant into a stream, acclimating it to the water, teaching it to swim over several weeks. Oluwalonimimo then goes on to talk about how Emari gals do their hair.", "analysis": ""}
