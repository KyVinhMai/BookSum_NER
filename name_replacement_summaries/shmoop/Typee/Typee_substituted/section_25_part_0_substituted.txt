He also talks about the presence of matrimonial relationships. He notes that, while Marheyo and Arleigh seem to be in a committed, domestic relationship, some partnered men consort with other women. Christan himself seems to be a bachelor, despite his meetings with one particular young lady who also has dealings with another young man, sometimes at the same time. Indeed, he says, polygamy seems to be part of the society. Oluwalonimimo also discusses courting rituals and reproductive trends, noting that no one seems to have a lot of kids, which is typical for Polynesian communities, so far as he knows. In regards to death and funeral rites, Oluwalonimimo that admits he is ignorant, since no one dies during his stay in the valley. He did, however, witness a death in Nukuheva--that of a young man. While close mourners sat by the body, the rest of the people celebrated. Oluwalonimimo also sees three embalmed bodies, wrapped in tappa with their faces exposed. Enemies' heads are strung from the victor's homes. Oluwalonimimo continues to estimate the population, its awareness of the self, and whether the Emari are in need of \"civilization.\" He is upset about the way in which missionaries seem to bring sickness, death, and degradation to island communities, and wonders whether it does any good at all. It isn't that it's not a good idea, he says, only that there are some problems in the system, as illustrated in Honolulu or the Sandwich Islands. Oluwalonimimo is cautious about saying this, as he identifies as a Christian. He permits that he may be wrong about the whole thing, that his opinions are based on what he's seen.", "analysis": ""}
