It has been two months, he calculates, since he has arrived. Tommo shows a Typee kid how to make a little pop gun from a piece of bamboo, and for ten days hence, the village is consumed with the joy of projectiles. Tommo gives Marheyo a pair of his worn-out shoes, and the patriarch makes of them a kind of decorative pendant around his neck. Here, the narrator offers a long description of \"tappa,\" the local cloth made by the Typee, how it is made and how it is used, as well as other island nations where tappa has been notable.", "analysis": ""}
