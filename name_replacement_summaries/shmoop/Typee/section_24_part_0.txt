Even the aged have good teeth! Where Nukuheva men were bad-looking, and the women good, Tommo believes that the \"uncontaminated\" Typee are wholly attractive, no matter the gender. Tommo talks about the various tones of complexion in the native people, as well as the \"papa\" root some females use to lighten their skin. He notes that explorers before him, since the sixteenth century, have written about the peoples' rare beauty. There are few European items in the valley, limited to things like the cotton Tommo himself brought and an old British musket in disrepair. As far as he can tell, Tommo says, everyone in the valley seems fairly laid-back most of the time, with those in power mixing with those not, and markers of power or class rarely visible at all. The one exception to this is Mehevi, and Tommo is grateful to this royal chief's good graces.", "analysis": ""}
