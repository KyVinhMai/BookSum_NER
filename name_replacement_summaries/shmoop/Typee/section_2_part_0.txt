The seeming strangeness of the native culture is immediately blotted out once the sailors arrive at the beach of Nukuheva, where there are more than 100 French soldiers who have set up a very European settlement.

Tommo tells the story of the wife of the British consulate, then living on the islands, and her meeting with a band of French soldiers.
