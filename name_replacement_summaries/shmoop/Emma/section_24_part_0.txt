Sure, he's rich and can do whatever he wants...but he wants to do this? London's a long way away. And it's expensive. And, well, more than a little silly. The Westons and Emma have a long talk about what Frank's haircut means. You can tell that there's not a lot going on in Highbury, huh? Mr. Knightley hears about Frank's haircut and mutters something under his breath about Frank being an idiot. Emma pretends not to hear him. Emma learns that the Coles are giving a party. She promptly decides not to go. The Coles, you see, aren't quite as high up the social ladder as the Woodhouses. In fact, they're only the second most important family in town. Emma spends several delightful minutes thinking about how she's going to turn their invitation down. There's just one problem - she hasn't gotten an invitation yet. As she finds out, everyone else in town is already invited. All of a sudden, the party doesn't look so bad anymore...maybe she would have gone! Finally, an invitation from the Coles arrives. Mr. Woodhouse is convinced that Emma will come down with a dreadful cold if she leaves the house for a party - but she manages to talk him out of his fears.", "analysis": ""}
