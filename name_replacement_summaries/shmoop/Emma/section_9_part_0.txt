They pause to swoon over Mr. Elton's house. After congratulating Harriet on her future prospects, Emma declares that she never plans to marry. After all, she's got the best house in town already - what more could she want? It's not like she'll ever fall in love! Harriet is aghast at Emma's declaration. Emma, an old maid? Horror of horrors!! In twenty years, she'll be like Miss Bates! Emma explains that the difference between Miss Bates and herself is money. Cash makes just about anything possible - even being an old maid. They arrive at the poor family's home. Emma deals with the poor honestly, kindly, and sympathetically. She doesn't even expect them to do more for themselves than they can actually do. She just helps where she's needed. Strange? Well, not really. Emma seems to have a knack for dealing with people who are worse off than she is. Harriet stands around for awhile. On the way home, Emma and Harriet run into Mr. Elton. Emma fakes an untied shoe to let Harriet have Mr. Elton all to herself - but they only end up talking about what Mr. Elton had for dinner. He's a fascinating guy. Desperate to make something happen, Emma breaks her shoelace. Unable to walk any further, she begs Mr. Elton to take them to his house. He's delighted to agree. Harriet and Emma trek to Mr. Elton's house. Emma tries to leave Harriet alone with Mr. Elton, but not much happens. Emma's a bit frustrated - Harriet doesn't seem to be making the most of her opportunities.", "analysis": ""}
