Apparently, he's made a sudden decision to travel to London and visit his brother. Emma arrives in time to hear her father discussing her visit to the Bates house with Mr. Knightley. As he looks at her approvingly, Emma blushes. She's glad that she seems to have done exactly the right thing for once. The next day, an express letter arrives at the Westons'. Mrs. Churchill finally died. After death, everyone seems a lot nicer than they were alive. Even Mrs. Churchill. Mr. Weston begins to think that he might have liked her, after all. Emma realizes at once what this means: Mr. Churchill, Frank's uncle, is a pretty easygoing guy. It was only Mrs. Churchill who kept Frank on such a short string. Now that she's gone, Harriet and Frank can be together at last! Emma decides that there's not much she can do immediately to help forward Harriet's love.
