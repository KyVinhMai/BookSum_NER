Who wouldn't be? Frank is obviously meant for her. And he's cute. And he will be rich, if the old aunt will ever get around to dying. Why, then, isn't she more excited? There are no butterflies in her stomach. After considering her state for a few days, Emma decides that she's just the right amount in love - she's not crazy about Frank, but, well, a girl's only got so many options! And she did imagine once that he would be perfect... A letter from Frank arrives at Mrs. Weston's house. As we've mentioned before, everybody is into everybody else's business in this town. Emma, of course, reads the letter. Frank writes very, very nicely. In fact, he's a perfect gentleman on paper. Emma notes that Frank says good things about Harriet in his letter. Could he...? And Harriet? Hmm...it's an interesting idea. Emma gives up her love interest in Frank. After all, arranging a match is just so much more interesting than being in one. Harriet's still moping about Mr. Elton. Let's be honest - Eeyore is probably more well-adjusted than Harriet. Emma argues that Harriet's fixation on Mr. Elton is actually a slap in the face to Emma, which snaps Harriet out of her misery. In Harriet's world, Mr. Elton might be perfect, but Miss Woodhouse - well, Miss Woodhouse is in a class of her own. Luckily, Emma feels exactly the same way.", "analysis": ""}
