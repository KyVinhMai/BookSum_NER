Mr. Woodhouse would be devastated if his last daughter left him. Oh, yeah - and also Harriet. First things first: Emma writes a letter to Harriet, explaining all that's happened. That's enough to ruin her day - but luckily, Mr. Knightley shows up just as she's getting really sad. And who could stay sad long with the perfect man around? Right after he leaves, she gets a letter from Mrs. Weston -which includes in it a letter from Frank. Frank's letter explains all that's happened ever since he met Jane. He also apologizes for seeming to lead Emma on - but he was convinced that she knew about Jane. He says lots of nice things about everyone - including Emma - and seems truly sorry. We know, we know - it's a bit hard to believe him. But Emma does.", "analysis": ""}
