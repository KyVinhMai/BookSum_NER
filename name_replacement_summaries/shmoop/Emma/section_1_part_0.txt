Weston's an all-around good guy - a great soldier, a gentleman, and a property owner. Let us emphasize that again: he's a good guy. Got it? As if that weren't enough, we also meet Mr. Weston's son, Frank Churchill. Why isn't he Frank Weston? That's a good question. More on that later.... Frank's the son of Mr. Weston's first marriage. Frank's been raised by a wealthy aunt, which means that Mr. Weston rarely sees him. Rumor has it that Frank might be returning to pay a wedding visit, however, which has the whole town a-flutter. Our narrator takes us back to the scene of the wedding, where Mr. Woodhouse is desperately trying to convince the entire wedding party that cake is bad for the health. He enlists the expert opinion of his doctor, Mr. Perry.", "analysis": ""}
