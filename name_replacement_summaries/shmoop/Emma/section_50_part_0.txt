He's about as excited to hear about Frank as he ever was - but he tolerates it for Emma's sake. After Mr. Knightley finishes the letter, he brings up some more important business: how can they get married without making Emma's father miserable? Emma already has a plan. It's about as good as most of her plans have been. If they wait to get married until after Mr. Woodhouse dies, Emma argues, then he'll never be unhappy. We told you it was a crappy plan. Luckily, Mr. Knightley agrees with our opinion. He's got an alternate solution. Instead of Emma moving to Donwell Abbey, Mr. Knightley proposes that he should move into Hartfield. That way, Mr. Woodhouse never has to leave his own home. Astonished at Mr. Knightley's liberality, Emma immediately agrees to think it over. In fact, she pretty much agrees to agree. Harriet remains the only sticky point in Emma's life now. And, as Emma reflects, it's probably too much to expect that Harriet could love three men in one year.", "analysis": ""}
