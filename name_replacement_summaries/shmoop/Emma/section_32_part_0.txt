{"name": "Chapter Thirty-Three", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-three", "summary": "More of the Eltons: Emma notices that the Eltons go out of their way to snub Harriet. This makes Emma hate them just a little bit more. Mrs. Elton takes a liking to Jane Fairfax. She tells Emma that \"we\" must bring her out into the world more. Emma wants no part of a \"we\" that includes Mrs. Elton. Or Jane Fairfax, for that matter. Nonetheless, she does pity Jane for the \"assistance\" that she's about to receive from Mrs. Elton. Even Emma can see that Jane is approximately 37 million times more of a gentlewoman than Mrs. Elton ever could be. Interestingly, soon after this visit Mrs. Elton grows suddenly cold towards Emma. As you can guess, Emma's rather OK with that. Emma wonders why Jane Fairfax is still staying with her aunts. It can't be too pleasant to stay with the Bateses - and now that Mrs. Elton's in the picture, Emma imagines that it must be insufferable. She talks Jane's situation over with Mrs. Weston when they next meet. Mrs. Weston suggests that perhaps Miss Bates unwittingly assisted Mrs. Elton's claim to \"protect\" Jane. Once her aunt asked for help, it might have been too hard for Jane to ask Mrs. Elton to leave her alone. Mr. Knightley, who's also part of the conversation, agrees. Perhaps he was the one to send the piano to Jane? Proclaiming that sending a huge gift to a lover anonymously is the sort of thing that only a naive man would do, Mr. Knightley seems to clear himself of any such suspicions. Emma slyly asks Mr. Knightley if he likes Jane. Mr. Knightley turns a bit red - but he declares that, although he thinks Jane is perfect, he's not in love with her. After he leaves, Mrs. Weston wonders aloud if Mr. Knightley doth protest too much.", "analysis": ""}
