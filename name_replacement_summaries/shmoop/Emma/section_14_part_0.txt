The gentlemen leave to smoke on their own while the women wait in the parlor . Mr. Elton bursts back into the parlor and cozies up to Emma and Mrs. Weston in a very, very strange manner. He sits on a loveseat with them and starts to tease Emma. It's all very improper. He even wants Emma to promise him to take care of herself. Emma, of course, decides to ignore him. It's snowing! Mr. Woodhouse panics and demands to go home immediately. In the bustle to leave, Emma somehow manages to get stuck in a carriage alone. With Mr. Elton. In case we forgot to mention it, a single girl alone with a single guy is a HUGE no-no. Here's why: Mr. Elton promptly starts to proposition Emma, using every bad cliche in the book. Astonished and angry, Emma accuses him of falsely leading Harriet on. Mr. Elton, astonished and angry in turn, declares that he would never think of slumming so low. He never liked Harriet - only Emma . Awkward silence. Awkward silence. The carriage drops Mr. Elton off, leaving Emma alone with her thoughts.", "analysis": ""}
