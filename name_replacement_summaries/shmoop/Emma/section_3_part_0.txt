As Emma decides, Harriet is the perfect friend - she needs all the help she can get. Case-in-point: Harriet's thrilled about her recent visit to a friend's farm, where she meets the stable farmer, Mr. Martin. Emma, of course, is not so thrilled to hear about her friend's exploits. Emma and Harriet meet Mr. Martin on the road. He's actually pretty cute, which worries Emma: what's the point of improving Harriet if she's going to be a farmer's wife? Deciding to do some damage control, Emma convinces Harriet that Mr. Martin isn't half as good a gentleman as, say, Mr. Knightley or Mr. Elton. Emma promptly decides to set Harriet up with Mr. Elton. Remember him? He's cute - for a minister - and he's got a nice pad with a great view of the market street.", "analysis": ""}
