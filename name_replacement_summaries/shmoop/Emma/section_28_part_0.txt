It's actually quite funny - we recommend you check it out! The upshot of this meditation is that Frank decides to have a ball of his own. Emma heads over to Randalls to help Frank plan the ball. There's only one problem: Randalls is a pretty small house. In fact, they might only be able to fit three couples in one room. And who ever heard of a dance with just six people? Frank and Emma spend the morning pacing around the rooms at Randalls. Surprisingly, the rooms don't seem to be getting any bigger. Mr. Weston wants to fit everybody in the house, anyway. Mrs. Weston isn't so sure. They all stand around, perplexed. A brilliant idea! Frank proposes that the Westons rent out the local pub and have their dance in the upper rooms. Later that day, Frank and Emma share their idea with Emma's father. Mr. Woodhouse is aghast, astonished, and argumentative. A public house? He's never even been in a public house. Who knows what sort of diseases might be lurking in the corners of its rooms? Emma thinks that Frank's idea is a brilliant one. She works with Frank to convince her father that the Crown might actually be safer than Randalls for a large group of people. Finally, Mr. Woodhouse comes around to Emma's way of thinking. Emma does have a way with words! Emma joins the Westons at the Crown to plan the party. It's a bit dirty, but it's nice and big. Mr. Weston paces through the halls. Mrs. Weston and Emma decide where to have dinner. Frank remains excited about everything.", "analysis": ""}
