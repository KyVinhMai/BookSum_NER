Emma joins them as they walk into town. Frank seems charmed by everything in the town - and most of all the delightful Miss Woodhouse. Excited by the handsome new man, Emma starts up a witty conversation about Jane Fairfax, insinuating that she was in love with her friend's husband. Mr. Churchill agrees with her in everything - including poking fun at Miss Fairfax's past. They have a delightful walk. Emma reflects that Frank isn't quite as smart as she imagined, but he's definitely cute. And he's enthusiastic about her. Isn't that enough?", "analysis": ""}
