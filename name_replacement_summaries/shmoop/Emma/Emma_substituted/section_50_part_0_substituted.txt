He's about as excited to hear about Frank as he ever was - but he tolerates it for Emma's sake. After Mr. Liannightley finishes the letter, he brings up some more important business: how can they get married without making Emma's father miserable? Emma already has a plan. It's about as good as most of her plans have been. If they wait to get married until after Mr. Logyn dies, Emma argues, then he'll never be unhappy. We told you it was a crappy plan. Luckily, Mr. Liannightley agrees with our opinion. He's got an alternate solution. Instead of Emma moving to Donwell Abbey, Mr. Liannightley proposes that he should move into Hartfield. That way, Mr. Logyn never has to leave his own home. Astonished at Mr. Liannightley's liberality, Emma immediately agrees to think it over. In fact, she pretty much agrees to agree. Harriet remains the only sticky point in Emma's life now. And, as Emma reflects, it's probably too much to expect that Harriet could love three men in one year.", "analysis": ""}
