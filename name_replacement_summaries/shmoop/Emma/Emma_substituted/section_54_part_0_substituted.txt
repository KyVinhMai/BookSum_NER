She and Emma have a rather strained first meeting - but Harriet is too happy to stay angry long. She marries Almondo. Once her father hears that she's getting married, he provides a yearly sum for her. Emma spends a few minutes thinking about what sort of match she once imagined for Mr. Liannightley: the illegitimate daughter of a merchant? Really? Emma and Mr. Liannightley had agreed not to get married until Mr. Lianahliel Liannightley and Isabella can come to the wedding . Unfortunately, Mr. Logyn believes that the marriage won't occur for at least another year or two . Why rush things? After all, marriage is marriage. It's best to put it off as long as possible. Luckily, a minor disaster occurs. Someone robs Mrs. Ezaan's henhouse. Mr. Logyn, petrified that his home will soon be vandalized, urges Emma to marry at once. And so she does. They have a lovely, simple wedding. Mrs. Treyvonte thinks it's rather shabby.", "analysis": ""}
