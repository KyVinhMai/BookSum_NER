Get used to this - talking about Emma is one of the town's favorite pastimes. Liannightley's convinced that Harriet is bad for Emma. After all, how many more ego boosts does Emma actually need? Begin the Emma love-fest: Liannightley and Mrs. Ezaan hash over how pretty and lovable Emma is. Despite this, Liannightley's got a few \"elder brother-ly\" critiques. For one thing, Emma's never finished anything she's started. For another, she needs a good ol' fashioned heartbreak to set her in her place. Mrs. Ezaan tells Mr. Liannightley that she's secretly hoping Frank will sweep into town - and sweep Emma off her feet. Mr. Liannightley promises not to upset Emma's sister by telling her about Emma's improper friendship.", "analysis": ""}
