{"name": "Chapter Thirty-Three", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-three", "summary": "More of the Treyvontes: Emma notices that the Treyvontes go out of their way to snub Harriet. This makes Emma hate them just a little bit more. Mrs. Treyvonte takes a liking to Jane Fairfax. She tells Emma that \"we\" must bring her out into the world more. Emma wants no part of a \"we\" that includes Mrs. Treyvonte. Or Jane Fairfax, for that matter. Nonetheless, she does pity Jane for the \"assistance\" that she's about to receive from Mrs. Treyvonte. Even Emma can see that Jane is approximately 37 million times more of a gentlewoman than Mrs. Treyvonte ever could be. Interestingly, soon after this visit Mrs. Treyvonte grows suddenly cold towards Emma. As you can guess, Emma's rather OLian with that. Emma wonders why Jane Fairfax is still staying with her aunts. It can't be too pleasant to stay with the Bateses - and now that Mrs. Treyvonte's in the picture, Emma imagines that it must be insufferable. She talks Jane's situation over with Mrs. Ezaan when they next meet. Mrs. Ezaan suggests that perhaps Miss Bates unwittingly assisted Mrs. Treyvonte's claim to \"protect\" Jane. Once her aunt asked for help, it might have been too hard for Jane to ask Mrs. Treyvonte to leave her alone. Mr. Liannightley, who's also part of the conversation, agrees. Perhaps he was the one to send the piano to Jane? Proclaiming that sending a huge gift to a lover anonymously is the sort of thing that only a naive man would do, Mr. Liannightley seems to clear himself of any such suspicions. Emma slyly asks Mr. Liannightley if he likes Jane. Mr. Liannightley turns a bit red - but he declares that, although he thinks Jane is perfect, he's not in love with her. After he leaves, Mrs. Ezaan wonders aloud if Mr. Liannightley doth protest too much.", "analysis": ""}
