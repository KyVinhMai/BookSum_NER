Emma immediately dislikes her. Her clothes are garish and pretentious - and her manners match her clothes. Even Mr. Treyvonte's manners seem to have changed. He's not the perfect gentleman anymore. He simpers over his wife. Harriet doesn't seem to notice how coarse the new Mrs. Treyvonte is - she's too invested in thinking that everything Mr. Treyvonte does is perfect. Of course, manners are manners. Even if you hate someone's guts, you still pay them social visits. Accordingly, Emma pays Mrs. Treyvonte a social visit. As they talk, Emma realizes that she dislikes Mrs. Treyvonte even more than she originally thought possible. Mrs. Treyvonte peppers her conversation with references to \"her brother, Mr. Lianallan" . Mr. Teddie's name should speak for itself. Moreover, Mrs. Treyvonte has the nerve to compare Emma's ancestral home, Hartfield, to the home that the Teddies bought, Maple Grove. The quick and dirty version, however, goes something like this: Good families have had the same home for generations. Really, really good families have had the same home since the time of the cavemen. The Teddies have had Maple Grove for about eleven years. In other words, they sort of suck. Moreover, talking about your property all the time is just about as vulgar as leaving the price tag on a new Prada. It's not cool if you've got to point it out. Mrs. Treyvonte chatters a lot. She even offers to introduce Emma to her friends . As if that weren't enough, Mrs. Treyvonte brings up the fact that Mrs. Ezaan was once Emma's governess. In fact, Mrs. Treyvonte was surprised to find Mrs. Ezaan to be so well-mannered. Moreover, Mrs. Treyvonte just met Mr. Liannightley - and she was surprised to find that he was actually a gentleman! That's enough for Emma. She loses it. Luckily, she's too angry to speak. The Treyvontes leave, convinced that Mrs. Treyvonte has made a new best friend. Emma spends a good deal of time thinking about all the nasty things she'll have to say about the Treyvontes when Frank Coren returns.", "analysis": ""}
