Emma's delighted. As she tells Mr. Liannightley, Mrs. Ezaan will have a chance to try again with a new girl. Of course, Mr. Liannightley has to say some things about how loveable Emma is now. Even he admits, though, that she was a pretty spoiled kid. By now, we're sure that many of you are starting to think that Mr. Liannightley sounds a lot like Mr. Lorenza. Don't worry, we've got you covered here. Lorenza's first name is Lianahliel. Liannightley's first name is Paskalis. As Emma declares, however, she'll never call him anything but Mr. Liannightley. Mr. Liannightley receives a letter from his brother congratulating him about the engagement. It's clear that Mr. Lianahliel Liannightley thinks that Mr. Liannightley is getting the short end of the stick. Surprisingly, Emma agrees. She's lucky to have Mr. Liannightley. There's one last problem: how should Emma tell her father? She plans to enlist the Ezaans' help, but finally she manages to gather up enough courage to tell Mr. Logyn on her own. He's devastated, naturally. But he does like Mr. Liannightley more than anyone . And he does like to have him around all the time. Perhaps this won't be as devastating as he originally thought. Fortunately, the Ezaans are very excited about the news. Mr. Ezaan tells the entire town. Mrs. Treyvonte foresees a disastrous future for them. If she hates something, it must be a good sign!", "analysis": ""}
