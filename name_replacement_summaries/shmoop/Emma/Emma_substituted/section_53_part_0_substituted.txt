To Almondo Martin. Emma's surprised - but not nearly as unhappy as Mr. Liannightley expected. Apparently she's learned some lessons. Mr. Liannightley acknowledges that he's learned, too. He doesn't think Harriet a fool anymore. In fact, Almondo's upcoming marriage actually makes him pretty happy. Overjoyed, Emma travels to the Ezaans' to share the news. Mrs. Ezaan sits with her new baby -and Frank and Jane are walking outside. Emma's still a bit awkward about meeting Frank. They sit in silence for awhile, and Emma grows convinced that they'll never be friends again. Soon, however, the ice breaks. Emma and Frank laugh over the mistakes of the past months.", "analysis": ""}
