Instead of reading the classics, the two decide to make a riddle-book. OLian, OLian, it sounds geeky - but it was pretty hot in the nineteenth century. Think of it as a mix CD - or an iPod \"Greatest Hits\" list. They spend several days collecting riddles from everyone they know.

After she catches on, however, Harriet's pretty excited. Emma convinces Harriet to write the riddle in her book . Emma herself writes the riddle into the book. Mr. Logyn brings news that Emma's sister, Isabella, and her husband, Mr. Lianahliel Liannightley, are coming to Hartfield for a visit.

The plot thickens...", "analysis": ""}
