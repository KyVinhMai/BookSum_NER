She wishes, above all, that she could tell Mr. Knightley how sorry she feels. Emma leaves early in the morning to call on Miss Bates. She can't really apologize, but at least she can show that she's sorry! When she gets to the Bates house, the servant lets her in. There's a strange scramble upstairs, though...almost as if people are running away. As it turns out, people were running away. Jane and Miss Bates, to be precise. Feeling even more penitent than before, Emma sits down to talk to Mrs. Bates. Eventually Miss Bates comes out of a back room, apologizing that Jane is \"ill.\" Miss Bates, quick to forgive, begins chatting with Emma about Highbury gossip. Most surprisingly, she tells Emma that Jane has finally accepted the governess position that Mrs. Elton found . She'll work for a friend of the Sucklings. Really, it's hard to imagine a better opportunity. Or at least, that's what Mrs. Elton keeps saying.", "analysis": ""}
