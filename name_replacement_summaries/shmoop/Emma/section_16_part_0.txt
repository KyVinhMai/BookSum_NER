Mr. Woodhouse mourns for their loss. Emma walks over to Mrs. Goddard's, where Harriet is staying. She decides that it's time to break the bad news to Harriet - who takes it surprisingly badly. Maybe she actually has feelings, after all? Harriet goes on a long rant about Mr. Elton's perfections and all the ways in which she's not worthy. We'll just skip over that. Emma regrets the fact that she, Harriet, and Mr. Elton are all stuck in Highbury. Unfortunately for Harriet, Mr. Elton is the current pin-up man at Mrs. Goddard's school - so she has to hear about how hot he is all the time. It sucks to be her.", "analysis": ""}
