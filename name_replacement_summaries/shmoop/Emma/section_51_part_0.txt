In the letter, she offers to send Harriet to London to stay with Isabella. Apparently Harriet happens to have developed a bad tooth. Isabella loves doctors. It's a match made in heaven. With Harriet gone, Emma can finally enjoy spending time with Mr. Knightley without feeling guilty. A little bit of distance can change everything! In her spare time, Emma pays a visit to Jane and the Bateses. As she walks up to the door, Emma remembers the horrible awkwardness of her last visit. Suddenly shy, she waits at the bottom of the stairs as the maid announces her name. This time, however, Jane comes running down to greet her. Emma congratulates Jane on her engagement. They both apologize profusely and hug each other. A sappy make-up scene ensues. Or rather, a sappy make-up scene would probably ensue. Unfortunately, Jane has other visitors, so this can't happen. In fact, her other visitor turns out to be none other than our old friend, Mrs. Elton. Mrs. Elton remains as catty and superficial as ever. It's so nice to know that some things never change. Mrs. Elton is pretty sure that Emma doesn't know anything about the engagement - and so she proceeds to do a lot of loud whispering behind one hand. It's pretty funny to all concerned. Even Jane has trouble hiding her laughter. Emma and Jane part as friends.", "analysis": ""}
