Emma's delighted. As she tells Mr. Knightley, Mrs. Weston will have a chance to try again with a new girl. Of course, Mr. Knightley has to say some things about how loveable Emma is now. Even he admits, though, that she was a pretty spoiled kid. By now, we're sure that many of you are starting to think that Mr. Knightley sounds a lot like Mr. Big. Don't worry, we've got you covered here. Big's first name is John. Knightley's first name is George. As Emma declares, however, she'll never call him anything but Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley receives a letter from his brother congratulating him about the engagement. It's clear that Mr. John Knightley thinks that Mr. Knightley is getting the short end of the stick. Surprisingly, Emma agrees. She's lucky to have Mr. Knightley. There's one last problem: how should Emma tell her father? She plans to enlist the Westons' help, but finally she manages to gather up enough courage to tell Mr. Woodhouse on her own. He's devastated, naturally. But he does like Mr. Knightley more than anyone . And he does like to have him around all the time. Perhaps this won't be as devastating as he originally thought. Fortunately, the Westons are very excited about the news. Mr. Weston tells the entire town. Mrs. Elton foresees a disastrous future for them. If she hates something, it must be a good sign!", "analysis": ""}
