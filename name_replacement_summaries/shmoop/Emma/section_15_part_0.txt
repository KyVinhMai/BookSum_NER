How could she have imagined such an unsuitable match for Harriet? And how could she have missed the fact that Mr. Elton wanted her, not her friend? Now that Emma realizes how blind she's been, she vows never to match-make again. Of course, she could set Harriet up with that new lawyer-fellow in town... But that would be breaking her vow. She goes to bed miserable... ...and wakes up pretty much OK. Austen's narrator writes some funny stuff here about the fickleness of youth. Check it out! After all, it's not like Mr. Elton really wanted anything but her money . And Harriet? Well, she's not really the romantic heroine type. She'll get over it.", "analysis": ""}
