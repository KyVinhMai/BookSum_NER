Instead of reading the classics, the two decide to make a riddle-book. OK, OK, it sounds geeky - but it was pretty hot in the nineteenth century.

After she catches on, however, Harriet's pretty excited. Emma convinces Harriet to write the riddle in her book . Emma herself writes the riddle into the book. Mr. Woodhouse brings news that Emma's sister, Isabella, and her husband, Mr. John Knightley, are coming to Hartfield for a visit.
