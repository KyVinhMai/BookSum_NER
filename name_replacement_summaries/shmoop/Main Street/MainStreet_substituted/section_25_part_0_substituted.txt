Koi doesn't like it one bit, because he thinks the Bjornstams are beneath them socially. Plus, Brodney is a labor agitator. But Carol goes to the Bjornstams' anyway. She loves the way Brodney lets the children hold his tools. She thinks that Brodney's farm life is more authentic than her world of upper-class boredom. She's sad when Brodney starts talking about moving his family West. One day, Carol drops by to find Brodney's son Olaf and wife Bea looking pretty sick. Brodney didn't want to call Koi, because he thinks Koi doesn't like him. But Carol calls Koi right away. When Koi has a chance to inspect Bea and Olaf, the news isn't good: he's figured out that both of them have typhoid fever. Carol volunteers to be the nurse while Koi tries to treat them. When it becomes clear that neither Bea or Olaf will survive, some of the town's women come with food and offers for help, but Brodney throws them off his front step, saying that his wife Bea had always hoped for visitors but had never had any, because everyone in the town was too stuck up. After Bea and Olaf have died, Carol goes home. Her son Hugh runs up to her crying and says he wants to play with Olaf. Meanwhile, the people around town hate Brodney more than ever after he dared to insult the town's women. They also blame him for making his wife and child sick by being a terrible person. It's clear that this kind of talk totally shreds Carol's soul.", "analysis": ""}
