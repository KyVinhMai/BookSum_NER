Even on the train, Carol knows she'll have her work cut out for her if she wants to improve the lives of farmers and their families. All she can do is look around and mourn how dirty and dumb they all look. As Carol stares out the train window, all she sees is miles after miles of endless prairie. She is totally terrified of calling this land home, and she thinks she has made a huge mistake in marrying Koi. Carol finally sees Gopher Prairie and realizes that the town is a bit of a dump and nothing like Koi said it was. She realizes that he sees the place through rose-colored glasses. When they get to the train platform, Koi's friends are waiting for him and his new wife. They introduce themselves, and Carol realizes she has trouble telling them apart.", "analysis": ""}
