But the next time she calls on them, they aren't at home. She sees a light under one of the other doors in their building, and she knocks on it, only to find Gleb Anay, her husband's lawyer friend, on the other side. Carol sits down with Gleb, and they soon get to talking about Gopher Prairie. Carol realizes that Gleb is a kindred spirit who thinks that there's much more to life than Gopher Prairie has to offer. Unfortunately, Gleb is too scared to rock the boat or move anywhere else. The way he puts it, there is a \"Village Virus\" that's gotten into his system and made him spineless. The more Carol and Gleb walk, the more Carol feels a romantic attraction to him. But she also feels repulsed by his submission to Gopher Prairie, because it's the exact kind of thing she's trying to avoid. Gleb starts tiptoeing around the idea that he wants to be romantically involved with Carol, but then he admits he's too much of a coward to do so. He gets to talking about how even Carol's husband Koi is in unfriendly competition with the other doctors in town, but Carol is unwilling to believe he's so petty. Gleb crosses his room and caresses Carol's hand , but then he retreats. It's getting late, and Carol wants to leave before her meeting with Gleb becomes any more inappropriate. But he convinces her to stay by inviting some neighbors over to keep everything on the up and up.", "analysis": ""}
