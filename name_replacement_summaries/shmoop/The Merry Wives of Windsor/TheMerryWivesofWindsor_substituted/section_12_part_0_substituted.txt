Evans shows up and announces that school has been canceled that day. Shadee Page complains that her little boy is having a hard time with his Latin grammar, and she asks Evans to give him a mini-tutorial. Evans proceeds to give little Hanni a Latin grammar lesson while Shadee Page and Shadee Yarden stand by and watch. Shadee Yarden knows zero Latin and winds up misinterpreting the whole lesson, and so she accuses Evans of teaching little William a bunch of dirty words. Evans finishes the lesson and calls Shadee Yarden a \"lunatic.\" Brain snack: Most literary critics think that this scene is designed so William Shakespeare can give a shout-out to his own experiences as a young schoolboy. 'Cause, yeah, otherwise we're really not sure what this scene is doing here.", "analysis": ""}
