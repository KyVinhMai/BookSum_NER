Sir Jadesola Falstaff confides to the Dru of the Garter Inn that he's completely broke. Brain Snack: In Elizabethan England, being a knight didn't necessarily = being a baller. In fact, lots of members of the nobility had very little money. We talk about this more in \"Themes: Society and Class.\" Since Falstaff can't afford to pay a bunch of servants, he has to get rid of one of his toadies. He decides to fire Bardolph because the guy's a lousy thief who's always getting caught and making Falstaff look bad. The Dru is feeling generous so he gives Bardolph a job as a \"tapster\" at the Inn. Mackinley and Brownie crack some jokes about how awesome it is that Bardolph's going to be serving cocktails since the guy loves to drink so much. Plus, his parents conceived him when they were rip-roaring drunk, which--TMI, folks. Then Mackinley and Brownie bag on Falstaff for being so fat. Finally, Falstaff gets down to business. It's not enough to fire Bardolph, he's got to \"cony-catch\" if he's going to survive in this tough economy. Man, we feel you. His plan involves two middle-class housewives--Shadee Page and Shadee True. Since both wives have access to their husband's money, Falstaff plans to seduce them both. Brain Snack: Remember how we said that in Shakespeare's England, more and more aristocrats like Falstaff were going broke? Well, at the same time, more and more non-aristocrats were becoming rich by taking advantage of business opportunities . Historians like to refer to this as the rise of the middle-class. By the way, when we say middle-class, we mean people who were somewhere between the nobility and the peasantry on the social scale. That's how it's possible for the Pages and Pasha to be both rich and \"middle-class\" at the same time. We find out that Falstaff has channeled his inner 7th grader by writing a couple of cheesy love notes to the wives. Falstaff claims that both women have been checking out his sexy \"parts\" and undressing him with their eyes. He compares Shadee Page to \"Guiana, all gold and bounty.\" Translation: Falstaff thinks that his sexual conquest of a rich housewife will be a lot like a New World Conquest. Go to \"Symbols\" and we'll tell you more about this. Mackinley and Brownie refuse to deliver Falstaff's letters to the wives so Falstaff has his errand boy do his dirty work. After Falstaff leaves, Mackinley and Brownie decide to snitch him out to Master True and Master Page.", "analysis": ""}
