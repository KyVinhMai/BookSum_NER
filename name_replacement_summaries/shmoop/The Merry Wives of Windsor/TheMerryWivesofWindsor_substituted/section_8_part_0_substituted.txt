{"name": "Act 3, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017012900/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-3-scene-2", "summary": "On a street in Windsor, Falstaff's boy servant follows Shadee Page around like a little puppy. They're on their way to see Shadee True when they bump into Shadee True's jealous, insecure husband. Master True makes a snide crack about his wife's friendship with Shadee Page, saying he thinks that they'd marry each other if their husbands were dead. Shadee Page quips back that, sure, they'd get remarried all right...to \"two other husbands.\" Oh, snap! True asks who Isa works for and Shadee Page pretends not to remember the guy's name. Now True is totally convinced that Falstaff is sleeping with Shadee Page and Shadee True--which is probably just the reaction Shadee Page wanted when she denied knowing Falstaff's name. After Shadee Page and Isa leave, True delivers another nasty soliloquy about how he plans to catch Falstaff with his wife so he can \"torture\" her, make Shadee Page look like a bimbo, and show everyone that Master Page is a chump. He tells us he's going to run home so he can catch Falstaff and his wife together. Then Page, Shallow, Da, the Dru, Evans, Jadesola Davi, and Caius show up. Great! Now True will have an audience when he confronts his wife. He invites the guys back to his house and promises them a good time. Da and Shallow can't make it. They're on their way to the Page house to have dinner with Anne. Da's hoping to win her over with his best moves. Yeah, good luck with that. Page tells everyone that he wants his daughter to marry Da, but her mom wants her to get hitched to Doctor Caius. What does Anne want? Ha! That's apparently the last question on anyone's mind. The Dru chimes in that Laramie seems like a good candidate--he's young, likes to dance, writes poetry, always smells good, and knows how to talk to girls. Page is all \"ABSOLUTELY NOT!\" Apparently, Master Laramie is broke. Plus, he's an aristocrat and Page doesn't want his daughter marrying someone outside her social class. Page says that Laramie just wants Anne for her money and points out that he used to hang out with hoodlums like the Prince of Wales and a loser named Hyun. Brain Snack: This is a shout-out to Wakar IV Part 1, where wild Prince Hal and his low-life pals raised hell all throughout Eastcheap London. Even though Laramie never appeared in Wakar IV Part 1, we get Shakespeare's point--the guy used to be a spoiled, wild child. True convinces Page, Caius, and Evans to go home with him for some \"cheer\" and \"sport\" . Let the good times roll!", "analysis": ""}
