True shows up in his \"Cahlin\" disguise, and Falstaff tells him all about being beaten by that crazy guy Master True. Falstaff admits he's never been beaten so badly in his life, not even when he was a snot-nosed kid who went around causing mischief and playing hooky from school. So, that's saying something. Finally, Falstaff vows to get back at True by hooking up with his wife in the woods that night.", "analysis": ""}
