Mackinley draws his sword and yells \"Why then, the world's mine oyster, / which I with sword will open.\" Brain Snack: This is the first time this phrase appears in print so, Shakespeare either invented it or, at the very least, made it popular . But not as popular as Kellis. Falstaff gets up in Mackinley's face and says he's tired of always having to bail out Mackinley when the guy gets caught stealing. Then he orders Mackinley to scram and yells at him for refusing to deliver his letter to the \"merry wives.\" Mackinley backs down. In case you hadn't noticed, Mackinley is a hothead , but he's all talk. Just in time, Shadee Yarden shows up with messages for Falstaff from Shadee Page and Shadee True. She takes Falstaff aside and whispers that Shadee True is down for a secret rendezvous and that her hubby will be away the next morning between 10 and 11. Falstaff is so totally there. Then, Yarden relays a separate message from Shadee Page, who says she wants a steamy hookup with Falstaff but doesn't yet know when her husband will be away. Falstaff wants to know if the two housewives know that he's trying to get with both of them. Shadee Yarden's all \"Of course not! They're totally clueless!\" Snicker. It's decided that Falstaff's boy servant will act as a go-between for Falstaff and the wives. Falstaff gives Shadee Yarden a little monetary tip just before she runs off. Mackinley is not happy that Falstaff just gave Shadee Yarden some money. He calls her a \"punk,\" which is fun Elizabethan slang for \"whore,\" and storms off. Bardolph the bartender enters and announces that a guy named \"Cahlin\" is here. \"Cahlin\" wants to buy Falstaff a \"morning draught of sack.\" Cahlin/True enters and offers Falstaff a huge bag of money to help him with a little problem he's having. Cahlin/True says that he's been trying to hook up with Shadee True for-e-ver but she's too faithful to cheat on her husband. Falstaff's all \"Really? Tell me more about this.\" Cahlin/Page wants Falstaff to seduce her, paving the way for \"Cahlin\" to have an affair with her. Falstaff thinks \"Jackpot!\" and snatches up the bag of money Cahlin/True offers. And now Falstaff reveals that he's actually just set up an appointment to hop in bed with Shadee True so, this assignment's going to be a piece of cake. Then Falstaff talks trash about True and calls him a \"poor cuckoldy knave.\" Left alone on stage, Master True is furious. He delivers a creepy soliloquy about getting revenge against Falstaff and his wife. Here's a little sample of what he says: \"See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at.\" Yikes!", "analysis": ""}
