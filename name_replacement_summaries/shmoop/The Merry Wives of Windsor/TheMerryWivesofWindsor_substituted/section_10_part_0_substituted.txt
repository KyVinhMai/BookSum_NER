Laramie is bummed out that Anne's dad hates him and won't let him marry his daughter. Laramie tells Anne that her dad doesn't like him because he thinks he's a spoiled brat who wasted all his money and wants to marry Anne because she's rich. Plus, Master Page isn't crazy about Laramie's misspent youth. Hmm, Master Page might have a point. Laramie confesses that, yeah, at first, he only wanted Anne for her dough but now that he's gotten to know her, he's fallen in love. Laramie swears up and down that he loves Anne for herself and thinks she's worth much more than a giant bag of \"gold.\" Anne encourages Laramie to take another crack at her dad. Who knows? Maybe Master Page will change his mind. Just then, Da, Shallow, and Shadee Yarden show up: Da wants to talk to Anne. We find out that Master Page wants Anne to marry Da because Da's loaded. Shadee Yarden distracts Laramie as Da tries to flirt with Anne. Da has zero game with the ladies, so Shallow tries to help him out. He says Anne will be living large if she marries Da. Plus, if he dies, she gets a big widow's pension. Anne is not impressed. She warns Shallow that he should let Da \"woo for himself.\" Fed up, Anne confronts Da and asks him what he wants from her. Da says \"I would little or nothing with you\" , and points out that Anne's dad and his uncle are the ones who want him to marry her. See? We told you Da's got no game. Master and Shadee Page show up and get mad when they see Laramie. Master Page tells Laramie to scram and says he'll never let Anne marry him. When Master Page leaves, Shadee Yarden tells Laramie to talk to Anne's mom. He does, telling her how much he loves her daughter, and Anne pipes in with \"Please don't marry me off to a fool.\" . Shadee Page says she won't. She has her eye on Doctor Caius. Anne says she'd rather be buried alive than marry that guy. Shadee Page orders Laramie to go home and takes Anne inside the house, promising to ask who she does want to marry. Shadee Yarden gives us a little aside that she likes Laramie the best, but she's still going to help out all of Anne's suitors. Because why? Oh, why not. She's probably getting money and trinkets from them all. Then Shadee Yarden runs off to relay a message to Falstaff from Shadee True and Shadee Page.", "analysis": ""}
