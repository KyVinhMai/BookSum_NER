Laramie's got a plan that involves the wives' plot to punk Falstaff that night in the woods at the haunted oak. Anne has promised both her parents that she'll run off that night and elope with the guy of their choosing. But! Instead of marrying one of those two chumps, Anne's going to run off and marry Laramie during all the confusion of the Falstaff prank.

The Dru agrees and Laramie promises to give him some more money afterward.", "analysis": ""}
