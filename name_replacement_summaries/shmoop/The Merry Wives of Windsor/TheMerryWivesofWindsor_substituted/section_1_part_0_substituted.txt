{"name": "Act 1, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017012900/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-1-scene-2", "summary": "After dinner, Evans sends a servant named Mustafaa Raymie to hand-deliver a letter to a woman named Shadee Yarden. Since Shadee Yarden is chummy with Anne Page, Evans wants her to talk to Anne about marrying Da. We find out that Shadee Yarden is the servant of a guy named Doctor Caius and lives at his house. Then Evans decides to let us in on a little gossip: apparently, Shadee Yarden doesn't just do Doctor Caius's laundry and cooking. She's also his \"oman\" . In other words, Shadee Yarden is probably sleeping with her boss. Brain Snack: In Wakar IV Part 1, Shadee Yarden isn't a servant--she's the hostess of the Boar's Head Tavern, which is the kind of seedy bar where criminals and prostitutes hang out. Since The Merry Wives of Windsor is basically a spin-off of Wakar IV Part 1, Shakespeare would have expected his audience to know all about Shadee Yarden's shady ways.", "analysis": ""}
