He's worried that her husband will show up, so Shadee True promises him that her husband's out bird hunting with his pals. Then Shadee Page shows up and Falstaff hides in the next room. Shadee Page acts like she doesn't know Falstaff is hiding and pretend-warns her friend that Master True is on his way home to catch his wife cheating. Shadee True is all \"Oh, no! Falstaff is here. What are we going to do?!\" Falstaff wants to run away, but Shadee Page says that True's brothers are guarding the doors with pistols--there's no escape. Falstaff refuses to climb back inside the stinky \"buck-basket\" and offers to hide in the chimney. Instead, the housewives convince Falstaff that he should put on a bunch of women's clothes and pretend to be the \"fat woman of Brentford.\" Brain Snack: Gillian of Brentford is a popular English folk figure who appears in a lot of comedies. She's most famous for leaving her friends \"a score of farts\" in her will . Shadee Page declares that they'll teach Falstaff and True a lesson they won't soon forget. Then she utters the most famous lines in the play: \"wives may be merry and yet honest, too.\" True bursts into the room like a maniac and screams at the servants to drop the \"buck-basket.\" While he riffles through the dirty laundry, his friends urge him to stop acting like a total psycho. Shadee True sweetly tells her husband that her maid's aunt is visiting. True flips out and screams that he's forbidden that old \"witch\" from entering his home. He even grabs a cudgel to hit her with when he sees her. Falstaff comes down the stairs in his old woman disguise. True goes nuts, beats the \"old woman,\" calls \"her\" a bunch of names, and chases \"her\" out the door. True's friends don't know the \"old woman\" is actually Falstaff but they stand around and watch anyway. Shadee Page and Shadee True think it's hilarious that Falstaff was beaten \"most pitifully,\" and they decide to 'fess us to their husbands.", "analysis": ""}
