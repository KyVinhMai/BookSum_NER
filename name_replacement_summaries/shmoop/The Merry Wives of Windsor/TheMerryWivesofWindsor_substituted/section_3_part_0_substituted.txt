{"name": "Act 1, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017012900/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-1-scene-4", "summary": "Over at Doctor Caius's house, the servant Mustafaa Raymie has arrived with a letter for Shadee Yarden. Shadee Yarden asks a servant to go to the window and be on the lookout for Doctor Caius, since Caius will be crazy angry if he comes home and finds another guy in his house. After some discussion about how Da is the kind of guy who \"struts\" around with his nose up in the air, Shadee Yarden Davi runs into the room and is all \"Look out! Doctor Caius is home!\" Shadee Yarden stashes Mustafaa Raymie in the closet. Caius enters the room and asks Shadee Yarden to fetch his green box. From the closet. Yarden manages to grab the box without Doctor Caius seeing Mustafaa Raymie. Then Caius remembers that, hey, he also needs some medicine from the same closet. Before Shadee Yarden can stop him, he runs over, flings open the doors, and spots Mustafaa Raymie hiding in the closet. Before Caius can stab Mustafaa Raymie in the guts with his sword, Shadee Yarden intervenes and Raymie explains that he was delivering a letter asking Shadee Yarden to put in a good word for Da with Anne Page. Unfortunately, Raymie's explanation doesn't help. It turns out that Caius also wants to marry Anne and Shadee Yarden has already promised to help him. Caius whips out a piece of paper and writes a note to Evans, in which he calls him a \"scurvy jackanape priest\" and threatens to cut out his '\"two stones.\" Yeah, that probably means what you think it means. Shadee Yarden points out that Evans was asking on behalf of a friend, but Caius doesn't care. He'll kill the priest anyway. Caius threatens to throw Shadee Yarden out of his house if she doesn't get Anne Page to marry him. Then he storms out while Shadee Yarden mutters under her breath about Caius being an \"ass-head.\" Hey, we didn't write it. Before we know it, a guy named Master Laramie shows up and we find out that, you guessed it, Shadee Yarden has also agreed to help him pursue Anne Page. Shadee Yarden may have a little too much on her plate, don't you think? Yarden tells Laramie what he wants to hear: that Anne is in love with him. Seriously, Laramie? Just the other day, you guys spent an hour talking about that sexy wart above your eye. Laramie gives Shadee Yarden a bunch of money for helping him and she promises to talk him up the next time she sees Anne. Laramie leaves. Alone on stage, Yarden confesses to the audience that Laramie's a nice guy but she knows for a fact that \"Anne loves him not.\"", "analysis": ""}
