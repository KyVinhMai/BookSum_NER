Since Mistress Quickly is chummy with Anne Page, Evans wants her to talk to Anne about marrying Slender. We find out that Mistress Quickly is the servant of a guy named Doctor Caius and lives at his house. Then Evans decides to let us in on a little gossip: apparently, Mistress Quickly doesn't just do Doctor Caius's laundry and cooking. She's also his \"oman\" . In other words, Mistress Quickly is probably sleeping with her boss. Brain Snack: In Henry IV Part 1, Mistress Quickly isn't a servant--she's the hostess of the Boar's Head Tavern, which is the kind of seedy bar where criminals and prostitutes hang out. Since The Merry Wives of Windsor is basically a spin-off of Henry IV Part 1, Shakespeare would have expected his audience to know all about Mistress Quickly's shady ways.", "analysis": ""}
