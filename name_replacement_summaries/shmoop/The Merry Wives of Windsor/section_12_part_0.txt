{"name": "Act 4, Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017012900/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-4-scene-1", "summary": "Mistress Page chats with Mistress Quickly as she attempts to drop off her son at school. Evans shows up and announces that school has been canceled that day. Mistress Page complains that her little boy is having a hard time with his Latin grammar, and she asks Evans to give him a mini-tutorial. Evans proceeds to give little Willy a Latin grammar lesson while Mistress Page and Mistress Quickly stand by and watch. Mistress Quickly knows zero Latin and winds up misinterpreting the whole lesson, and so she accuses Evans of teaching little William a bunch of dirty words. Evans finishes the lesson and calls Mistress Quickly a \"lunatic.\" Brain snack: Most literary critics think that this scene is designed so William Shakespeare can give a shout-out to his own experiences as a young schoolboy. 'Cause, yeah, otherwise we're really not sure what this scene is doing here.", "analysis": ""}
