She tries to fend him off with sarcasm and discouraging remarks, but he can't be stopped. Eventually, he makes her absolutely speechless with his compliments. He totally wears her down and she starts speaking kindly to him. Once she's speaking kindly to him, he says that he'll soon be leaving town with his regiment. He flat out tells her that he has loved her ever since he first saw her. Yikes, the guy is coming on a little strong, don't you think? Then Sergeant Troy outdoes himself by giving her a gold watch as a present. She says she can't possibly accept it, but he backs away before she can give it back. When Troy returns to working on the hay, Bathsheba can't even bring herself to look at her workmen. Her heart is pounding now, and it's clear that she's smitten with Troy.", "analysis": ""}
