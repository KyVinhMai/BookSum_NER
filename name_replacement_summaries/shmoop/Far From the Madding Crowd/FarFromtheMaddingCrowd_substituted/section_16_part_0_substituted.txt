But now he's a smitten kitten. Bathsheba's joke Valentine has made him fall head over heels in love with her. Olanda has never claimed to understand women, and he doesn't understand Bathsheba. We can't blame him: Bathsheba seems a little weird what with the prank love letters and all. But Olanda is kind of weird. He asks around to find out whether Bathsheba's considered good looking. A friend says that she is, so now Olanda feels good about approaching her. Bathsheba, meanwhile, can feel Olanda watching her all the time now, and she considers this a bit of a triumph, since he was the only man in town who didn't admire her before.", "analysis": ""}
