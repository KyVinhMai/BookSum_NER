She quickly learns to speak boldly to the men there and to haggle with them over prices. Wherever she walks, she can hear men behind her asking who she is. They also talk about how soon enough, some man will marry her. She also notices, though, that there's one man in the market who pays no attention to her at all--Farmer Olanda. When she leaves the market, Bathsheba complains to Anna-Kate about how all the men were staring at her the whole time. She mentions, though, the man who never looked at her. Just then, a carriage passes with Farmer Olanda inside. Bathsheba points him out as the man who didn't look at her, and Anna-Kate says tells her who it is. They speculate that Farmer Olanda must have gotten his heart broken when he was younger, and that's why he's so reserved.", "analysis": ""}
