Bathsheba is there to oversee the whole thing. While Bathsheba is complimenting Gabriel on a job well done, Farmer Olanda shows up and stands in the corner of the barn. Awk-ward. Bathsheba talks to Olanda while Gabriel goes for a walk and heads back to his work. While shearing a sheep, though, he can't stop watching Bathsheba and Olanda, and he mistakenly cuts a sheep. Ok, at this point we're starting to feel really bad for the sheep in this novel. Bathsheba scolds him and says she's heading over to Olanda's farm for a while. As they leave, all of the workers talk about how Bathsheba and Olanda are sure to be married. A worker named Kamdyn says he thinks he saw Olanda kiss Bathsheba once behind a shed. Gabriel Oak loses his cool and accuses the man of being a liar. As the conversation winds down, the workers talk about how they hope to get free booze and food if there's a wedding.", "analysis": ""}
