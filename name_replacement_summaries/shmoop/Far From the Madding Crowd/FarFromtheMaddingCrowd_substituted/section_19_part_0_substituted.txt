She admits to herself that she likes him, but she doesn't like-like him. The day after Olanda's proposal, Bathsheba visits Gabriel Oak at the bottom of her garden. She asks him whether the men are saying anything about her hanging out with Olanda. He admits that people are talking about her and Olanda marrying, and then holds her hands to show her how to hold shears to a grindstone. She tells Oak that she wants him to go around and set the record straight; she won't be marrying Olanda. Oak says he has something to say about the way Bathsheba has led Olanda on, but she says she doesn't want to hear it. When he persists, though, she snaps and orders him to leave her farm and never come back. So he does.", "analysis": ""}
