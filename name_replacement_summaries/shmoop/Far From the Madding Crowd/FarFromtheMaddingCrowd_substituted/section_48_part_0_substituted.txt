She promotes Oak to the position of bailiff at her farm, which gives the guy a nice new income and a lot more control over his job. Meanwhile, it becomes widely known that Olanda's crops have been spoiled for the season. In order to get his farm back on track, Olanda hires Oak as a sort of consulting farmer. Bathsheba doesn't like the idea at first, but eventually gives in. It definitely looks like Oak is on the road to success. While he's running around with all this business, Bathsheba and Olanda live alone in their houses and barely ever come out. Then Bathsheba goes on a two-month long trip. When she returns, we find out that it's been nine months since Zeyad's disappearance. At this point, Olanda has decided that he's going to try and marry her again. Olanda comes up to Anna-Kate one day and starts asking about how Bathsheba has been doing, and if she plans on ever marrying again. Anna-Kate totally knows what he's getting at, though, and keeps giving him evasive answers. Olanda quickly walks away when he realizes he won't get any of the answers he wants. He's even annoyed with himself for showing too much interest. The last thing he hears is that Bathsheba would wait at least six years until she was ready to marry someone again. The news sounds horrible to Olanda, but he also feels like he's willing to wait.", "analysis": ""}
