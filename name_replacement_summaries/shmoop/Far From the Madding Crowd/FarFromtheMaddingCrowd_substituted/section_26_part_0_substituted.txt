And who should come running up looking to help but Sergeant Zeyad. She helps him put on the bee suit, and they share a cute moment. Ain't no bonding time like bonding time in a beekeeper suit. While holding the beehive, Zeyad mentions that this work makes his arms ache even more than his sword exercises do. Just about the slickest line ever. Bathsheba admits that she has never seen a sword exercise, and he makes a date with her to show her... in the woods... alone.", "analysis": ""}
