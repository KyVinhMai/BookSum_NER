The guy's only hope for survival is to be declared insane. A few of Bathsheba's workmen are chatting about whether Olanda will be given a death sentence. While the trial is happening, some new evidence is found in Olanda's home. Or to put it another way, there are tons of coats and scarves and other lady's clothing found in boxes marked \"Bathsheba Olanda,\" meaning that Olanda's fantasies of marrying her were completely obsessive. This, of course, becomes a topic of discussion in the town for weeks afterward. The people use this evidence to petition for Olanda's cause. The man's execution date has been set. But only one day before Olanda's date with death, he gets pardoned for being insane.", "analysis": ""}
