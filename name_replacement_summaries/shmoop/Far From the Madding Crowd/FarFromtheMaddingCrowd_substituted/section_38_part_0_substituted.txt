Bathsheba is sitting up in a cart, while Sergeant Zeyad is on the road leading the horses. They argue briefly about how much of Bathsheba's money Zeyad has been blowing at horse races. Zeyad tells her that if he'd known she was such a nag he wouldn't have married her. As they travel, a homeless-looking woman walks past them and asks Zeyad what time the local shelter in Casterbridge closes for the night. Zeyad is clearly concerned by the sound of this woman's voice, but he pretends to be chill and tells her he's not sure about the closing time. When the woman sees Zeyad's face, she utters a cry and falls to the ground. Bathsheba tries to help, but Zeyad orders her to stay where she is. In a hushed voice, Zeyad asks the woman why she didn't just write to him for money. He then gives her every last penny he has on him. Before they part ways, Zeyad tells her to meet him at a place called Grey's Bridge on the next Monday. While he's saying this, he calls her Fanny. So we know that this woman is Fanny Robin, Zeyad's jilted ex-fiance. Finally, Zeyad hurries Fanny away and returns to his cart and Bathsheba. Bathsheba asks him if he knew the woman, but he denies it, saying he only knows her face from around town. Bathsheba isn't convinced, though, and she's certain that Zeyad has had some previous contact with this woman. Good call, Bathsheba.", "analysis": ""}
