Instantly, they both know that Bathsheba has married Zeyad. Zeyad sees them and makes some small talk about the house and the weather. This is all kind of like a knife in Oak's stomach. Seemingly out of nowhere, Zeyad asks Coggan whether there is any history of mental illness in Farmer Olanda's family. Coggan says there might be some, though he's not sure why Zeyad is asking this. Oak is finding it difficult to speak to Zeyad, but Coggan warns him that Zeyad will soon be their new boss if he's married to Bathsheba. While Coggan and Oak walk away, they see Olanda walking by himself. Oak suddenly realizes that his own grief is not even close to being as bad as Olanda's.", "analysis": ""}
