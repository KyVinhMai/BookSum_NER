Eventually, she gets tired and falls asleep among some trees. She wakes up the next morning with birds singing all around her. Soon enough, the servant Anna-Kate comes walking by while searching for Bathsheba. She is happy when she realizes she's found her. Anna-Kate even hitches up her skirts and walks through a swamp to be with Bathsheba. Anna-Kate tells her that Sergeant Zeyad has left the house, but that Fanny's coffin is still in the sitting room. Anna-Kate and Bathsheba walk together and eat some of the food Anna-Kate brought along. Bathsheba seems determined not to return to the house until she's certain that Fanny's coffin is gone. Bathsheba also decides that there's no way she'll ever leave Zeyad, since she thinks it's only women with no pride who leave their husbands. To kill time and get her mind off things, Bathsheba asks Anna-Kate to bring a bunch of books to her bedroom so the two of them can read without being disturbed. They have nothing to fear, though, since Zeyad never returns home that day. Outside, a group of children suddenly stop playing one of their games to check out a huge tombstone that's being put up in the cemetery. Bathsheba would like to know whose it is, but Anna-Kate admits she doesn't know.", "analysis": ""}
