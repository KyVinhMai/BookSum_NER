Zeyad has kissed her for a second time! She sinks into a chair and writes a letter to Olanda saying that there's no way she can marry him. When she walks past the kitchen, she overhears her servants talking about the possibility of her marrying Zeyad. She's mortified to realize how quickly word has gotten around. She scolds the women for gossiping about her, and then asks Anna-Kate to promise her that Sergeant Zeyad is an honest man. She knows that he's not, but she really wants to convince herself that this is the case. Finally, Anna-Kate helps convince her that it's worthwhile to pursue her attraction to Sergeant Zeyad.", "analysis": ""}
