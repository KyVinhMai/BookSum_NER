Basically, he lives for the present... but not exactly in a good way. He never expects anything of life, so he's never disappointed. He's fairly honest with men, but he lies to women all the time. Deep down, Troy believes that if you treat women well they'll never be attracted to you: essentially that \"nice guys finish last.\" He comes over to her farm and starts helping out with some of the work. Bathsheba sees him and blushes as she walks by.", "analysis": ""}
