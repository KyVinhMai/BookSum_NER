She's not there, though. By this point, we're told that Boldwood is used to being in love and isn't afraid of it anymore. Huh. That was quick. He goes off to seek Bathsheba at the pool used for washing sheep. Once again, Oak is there with her, along with the rest of her farmhands. When he gets a chance to speak to her alone he comes out with it and asks her to marry him. Yup, that's how they went about it back in the old days. Bathsheba politely refuses, which just opens up the floodgates of Boldwood's passion. The guy practically drops to his knees to tell her how much he loves her. The sad thing is that Bathsheba ultimately knows it's her fault for making him feel this way because of the Valentine she sent him as a joke. Bathsheba tries to give him the whole, \"It's not you; it's me\" routine, but Boldwood isn't satisfied. In a last ditch effort Boldwood reminds her how rich he is. But it's still not enough. Bathsheba doesn't love him. Reminder: Oak wasn't rich enough for Bathsheba, and Boldwood isn't lovable enough. Bathsheba wants both love and money. Finally, she tells him that she won't refuse him outright, even though she'll probably never marry him. She thinks this is the nice thing to do, but it's probably way worse for him in the long run. With that, Boldwood walks away, telling Bathsheba that he'll wait forever if he needs to. But one day, he believes she'll be ready to marry him. All in all, a super-uncomfortable chapter.", "analysis": ""}
