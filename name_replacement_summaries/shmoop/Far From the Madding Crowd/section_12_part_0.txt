Liddy asks Bathsheba if she noticed Farmer Boldwood at church that week, since her pew is directly opposite his. Liddy finds it amazing that Boldwood never once looked at Liddy throughout the entire church service. At this moment, Bathsheba remembers a Valentines Day card she bought. She was going to send it to a little boy, to cheer him up. But just as she's about to address it, Liddy thinks out loud how fun it would be to send it anonymously to Farmer Boldwood. This idea gives Bathsheba pause. Eventually, Bathsheba talks herself into doing it. Worse yet, she decides to seal the letter with a wax stamp that says, \"Marry Me\" on it. Bathsheba is the queen of head games, and this letter is really going to mess with Boldwood's noggin. The narrator tells us that Bathsheba has no clue what she's getting into when she sends off the letter. We partially believe that.", "analysis": ""}
