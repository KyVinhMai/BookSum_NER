Oak knows all about falling in love. He's a pro. But he has a tough time learning how to get out of love. He's uber-depressed at this point and probably is listening to breakup music. If that weren't enough, a really bad thing happens on top of his rejection. One of his dogs, feeling a little too eager, starts chasing his sheep around a field while Oak is asleep. And wouldn't you know it, the dog chases all the sheep right off a cliff into a nearby chalk pit. Nearly every sheep Oak owns is killed. Financially speaking, the guy is toast. Everything he has worked hard for is gone. Oak's eager dog is taken out and shot the next day. At the end of it all, Oak has enough belongings to pay off his debts. But that's it. He comes out of the situation without a dollar to his name. Ugh.", "analysis": ""}
