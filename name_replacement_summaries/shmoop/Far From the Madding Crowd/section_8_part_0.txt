The narrator describes Liddy as a lighthearted English country girl. They hear someone riding a horse up to the door of the house, and Bathsheba sends a servant to go check it out. When the woman opens the door, a man with a low voice asks if Miss Everdene is at home. The guy is a rich neighbor named Mr. Boldwood. Bathsheba doesn't want to see him, though, because she's not presentable. The man just wants to know if there's been any word about Fanny Robin. When Boldwood leaves, Bathsheba asks who he is, and her servants say that he's a handsome, respected man who's been courted by all the women of the neighborhood. But apparently this guy wants to stay a bachelor forever. Liddy asks, out of the blue, whether anyone has ever proposed to Bathsheba. Bathsheba says yeah, but that she said no because the man wasn't good enough for her. She's talking about Oak, btw. Bathsheba admits that she liked Oak. Oh yeah? That's kind of a shocker. Bathsheba doesn't tell Liddy that the man she's talking about is her new shepherd. The meeting is broken up by the arrival of Bathsheba's workmen, who have come to collect their wages. Without a bailiff anymore, Bathsheba is in charge of this business herself.", "analysis": ""}
