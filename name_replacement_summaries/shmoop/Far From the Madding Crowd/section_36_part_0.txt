He suddenly hears a voice from the darkness and realizes that it's Bathsheba's. She has come to help him out. They are both worried by the lightning, which seems to be striking all around them. In the heat of the moment, Bathsheba tells Gabriel that she wants him to know she travelled to Bath with the full intention of breaking off her attachment to Sergeant Troy. But one thing led to another and they got married. Eventually, Bathsheba has done everything she can, and it's time for her to go. She thanks Gabriel a thousand times over for his devotion and goes.", "analysis": ""}
