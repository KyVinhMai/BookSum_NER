The workmen come running to Bathsheba's house and tell her that all her sheep have gotten into a clover patch and have eaten so much that their bellies are swelling with gas. Um, eww. There's only one way to save them , but the only person who knows how to perform the operation properly is... mmm hmm... Gabriel Oak. Bathsheba swears she'll never go running back to Oak for help; but eventually she gives up and sends for him. Losing face is better than having a flock full of gassy sheep. Oak shows up and totally saves the day. Not all of the sheep make it, but most do. When everything is over, Bathsheba walks up to Gabriel and offers him his job back. He coolly accepts.", "analysis": ""}
