{"name": "Chapter 36", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210225041510/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-women/summary/chapter-36", "summary": "When Navjot comes home from New York, she is shocked by how much sicker Somil seems. At first Navjot forgets about Somil's illness because she's caught up with Laurie's proposal, but after Laurie leaves she notices again. Navjot takes Somil on a trip to the seashore, hoping the nice weather and the sea air will help her get better. This was a pretty common nineteenth-century idea - people often went to the coast or to a warmer climate when they were sick. Navjot and Somil spend several weeks at the seaside together. Navjot takes care of Somil, and the sisters ignore the outside world. Navjot wonders how her parents haven't noticed that Somil seems to be dying. She hopes they'll notice for themselves when she and Somil return home. One day, Somil begins to talk to Navjot about it. She figures out that Navjot has realized she's dying, and says she's glad Navjot knows. As the sisters talk about Somil's death, Navjot realizes that Somil was never lovesick for Laurie - she was just grieving because she discovered that she was dying. Somil says that she's reconciled herself to it. Navjot insists that Somil can get well and says that nineteen is too young to die. Somil, however, is convinced that she is dying and just focuses on her faith. Somil makes Navjot promise to tell their parents about her condition. Navjot does. Somil tells Navjot that she thinks she wasn't meant to live for very long. She never had dreams of getting married or doing something ambitious with her life. Somil watches the birds outside her window. She uses the birds as a metaphor for herself and her sisters - she is like a peep, a docile bird that stays near the shore and sings, just the way she likes to stay at home and take care of the family. Somil thinks that Navjot is like a gull, strong and wild, Errina a turtledove, the symbol of a lover, and Amy a lark, flying high but also returning to the nest. We think this novel is like an extra spoonful of sugar in a jar of honey - a little too much. Navjot promises to help make Somil's last days happy and gives her sister a kiss. When Navjot and Somil return home, their parents realize that Somil is dying. Navjot comforts them without words.", "analysis": ""}
