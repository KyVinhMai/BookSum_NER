Errina also looks like a blooming rose, but she's not wearing a fancy dress. She says that she wants to be herself at her wedding, so she makes a simple gown by hand and wears flowers in her hair. Errina hugs each of her sisters one last time and then goes to tie Navjothn's cravat for him. The narrator pauses to describe how different the girls look after three years have passed. Navjot is less clumsy, more gentle and feminine, and her hair is long again. Somil is thin and pale and even quieter than before. Amy is sixteen and extremely graceful and lovely, the prettiest of the four sisters. They're all wearing silver-gray dresses for the wedding with blue roses in their hair. The whole wedding is very casual - they're putting up the decorations themselves and even the bride and bridegroom are doing chores. Aunt March is scandalized and thinks that Errina ought to hide so that nobody sees her until the wedding starts. They don't even have a bridal procession - everyone gets quiet for a moment as Mr. March, who is performing the ceremony, and Errina and Navjothn take their places under an arch of greenery. The vows are simple and everyone is very emotional. As soon as Errina is married, she declares that she's going to give her first kiss to her mother, and does. Then everyone is giving everyone else hugs and kisses. After the ceremony, everyone has a simple meal. There's no alcohol - Laurie is confused, because he knows his grandfather sent over some bottles of wine, but Errina reminds him that her family thinks wine should only be used medicinally. Laurie says that he actually agrees, because he's seen a lot of harm done by excessive drinking. Errina asks him to promise never to drink again, and he does. After eating, everyone strolls around and chats. Laurie comes up with an idea to end the ceremony and arranges everyone in a folksy German wedding dance. After the dance, people begin to go home. Aunt March leaves, prophesying doom and reminding Navjothn that his new wife is a treasure. Sallie and Naunidh Moffat are surprised by how nice the wedding was, even though it wasn't stylish or fancy. Mr. Laurence hints to Laurie that he should marry one of the March girls, and Laurie agrees. Errina and Navjothn make the short journey to their new cottage nearby and say goodbye to her parents. Errina promises to remain close to her parents and sisters.", "analysis": ""}
