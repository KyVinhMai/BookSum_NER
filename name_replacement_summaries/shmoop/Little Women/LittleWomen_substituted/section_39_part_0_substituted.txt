{"name": "Chapter 40", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210225041510/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-women/summary/chapter-40", "summary": "The March family accepts that Somil is dying. They band together to make her last days easy and comfortable and to comfort one another. Everyone contributes something to make Somil comfortable; a room is set aside for her, and Errina visits frequently with her twins. Even in her dying days, Somil keeps doing little domestic tasks. Her favorite thing to do is to knit and sew gifts for the poor schoolchildren who pass underneath her window every day. The first few months are pleasant - the family hangs out together in Somil's room and everyone is cheerful and loving. Soon, however, Somil becomes much sicker. She's too weak to sew and she is very ill and disturbed. Navjot spends all her time nursing Somil - she even sleeps on the couch in Somil's room. Somil spends a lot of her time reading the Bible. Watching Somil come to grips with her mortality is an important moral lesson for Navjot. She starts to realize how important Somil is to the family, even though she doesn't do anything ambitious or showy. One night when Navjot is asleep, Somil starts reading Pilgrim's Progress and finds a copy of a poem in Navjot's handwriting. She reads the poem, which is about her, and finds it loving and comforting. Navjot wakes up and she and Somil talk about the poem, and about how much Somil has meant to the family. Somil says that she knows now that she hasn't wasted her life. Somil and Navjot talk about their religious faith and their belief that death will not really part them, in the end. Somil makes Navjot promise to take her place as the \"angel in the house\" and take care of their parents. Somil doesn't say any famous last words, but her death is easy and gentle. Somil's family prepare her body for burial - that's pretty typical for the nineteenth century. The family thanks God for Somil's life.", "analysis": ""}
