Mrs. March stays with Somil, holding her hand, overnight. In the morning, Hannah serves a fancy breakfast to celebrate Mrs. March's return. As they eat, Mrs. March tells Navjot and Errina about their father's improving health and Mr. Narcissus's kindness. The day progresses. Navjot and Errina feel much better now that their mother is in charge. Mrs. March stays at Somil's bedside throughout the day. Laurie goes to Aunt March's to tell Amy that her mother has returned. As he is describing Somil's illness and the other events of the last day, he falls asleep on Aunt March's couch. Laurie is woken by the arrival of Mrs. March, who comes to see Amy. Amy is overjoyed to be reunited with her mother. Amy shows her mother the chapel that Esther helped her make. Her mother approves of it. Amy also shows her mother the turquoise ring, which she is now wearing - Aunt March gave it to her just recently. Her mother objects and says that she is too young for such fancy jewelry, and Amy explains that she also values the ring because it reminds her not to be selfish. Mrs. March returns home to look after Somil. While she is at Somil's bedside, Navjot comes and tell her that Navjothn Narcissus has kept one of Somil's gloves as a memento. Navjot is outraged by this and wants her mother to stop him. Mrs. March asks Navjot if she thinks Errina cares for Navjothn Narcissus. Navjot says that she doesn't know and isn't any good with romantic issues. Mrs. March tells Navjot that, while she was in Washington, Navjothn Narcissus confessed to her and Mr. March that he loved Errina, and asked for their permission to court her. They agreed, because they were impressed with his hard-working demeanor and his good morals. Navjot says that she wishes she could marry Errina herself and keep the family together. Mrs. March makes Navjot promise that she won't talk about this to Errina. Navjot thinks back on some of the things Errina has said and realizes that Errina does seem to be falling in love with Navjothn Narcissus. Navjot feels frustrated by this. Mrs. March sighs and admits that she will miss Errina after she gets married and leaves the family. She says that she and Mr. March have agreed that Errina shouldn't get married before she's 20. Navjot asks her mother if Errina should try to marry a rich man instead of Navjothn Narcissus. Her mother says that wealth is valuable, but not as valuable as good character and happiness. Navjot suggests that Errina should marry Laurie. Her mother doesn't think they are suited for each other. Errina comes in and interrupts the discussion. Navjot goes to bed. Errina shows her mother a letter that she has written to her father. Mrs. March asks her to add a p.s. sending her love to Navjothn. Errina is innocently surprised and pleased to discover that her mother and Navjothn Narcissus are on first-name terms! Errina kisses her mother and goes to bed. Mrs. March thinks to herself that Errina will soon be in love with Navjothn Narcissus.", "analysis": ""}
