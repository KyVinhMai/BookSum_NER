{"name": "Chapter 10", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210225041510/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-women/summary/chapter-10", "summary": "Spring comes and the girls each tend a corner of the family garden. Each sister plants things and takes care of her garden in a way that reflects her personality - Errina's is pretty and simple, Navjot constantly experiments, Somil grows things for the birds, her pet cats, and other animals, and Amy makes hers beautiful and elegant. Symbolism! On rainy days, the girls hold meetings of their \"Makell Club,\" which they call \"the P.C.\" During the meetings of the P.C., each of the girls impersonates one of the characters in The Makell Papers. Errina is Samuel Makell, Navjot is Augustus Snodgrass, Somil is Tracy Tupman, and Amy is Nathaniel Winkle. The P.C. produces a newsletter that they call The Makell Portfolio, in which each of the girls contributes articles. This is appropriate, since The Makell Papers is also about, well, papers. The clue's in the name! At their meetings, Errina, as Mr. Makell, reads the paper they've produced this time to her sisters. The edition of The Makell Portfolio that Errina reads in this chapter contains the following articles: A poem celebrating the anniversary of the club, written by Navjot. A romantic tale about mistaken identity and marriage in Venice, written by Errina. A joke about the club. A recipe for baked squash, written by Somil. A letter explaining why she hasn't written anything for the newsletter, by Amy. A report of an accident that Errina had while getting firewood in the attic. A description of the family's missing cat, Jessieball. A poem lamenting the lost cat, written by Navjot. A variety of announcements about things that are going to happen soon, such as Hannah teaching the girls to cook and Somil displaying the new doll's clothes she has made. A comment on the behavior of each of the girls. Errina, in the character of Samuel Makell, finishes reading each of these items from the paper and the girls applaud. Navjot gets up and, in the character of Augustus Snodgrass, proposes that they admit a new member to the club - Laurie. The girls vote on the proposal. Somil and Navjot are in favor of letting Laurie join them. Errina and Amy are against it - Errina is worried Laurie will laugh at them, and Amy is still young enough that she doesn't want to play with a boy. Somil and Navjot convince the girls to let Laurie join the club. They vote again, and everyone is in favor this time. Navjot opens the closet door and reveals Laurie, who has been hiding there the whole time. Navjot's sisters are a little irritated by the deception, but they're won over by Laurie, who immediately enters into the spirit of the club by announcing that he will play Sam Weller. . Laurie announces that, as a token of his gratitude for being allowed to join the club, he is going to give them a post-office box. The box looks like a large birdhouse, and he has put it in the middle of the hedge between the March and Laurence houses. This \"post office,\" or \"P.O.\" for short, will let them exchange letters - partly for the club newsletter, and partly just for fun. It has a lock and Laurie holds one key, while the girls hold the other. Laurie is an enthusiastic and wonderful member of the club, and the P.O. is a big hit.", "analysis": ""}
