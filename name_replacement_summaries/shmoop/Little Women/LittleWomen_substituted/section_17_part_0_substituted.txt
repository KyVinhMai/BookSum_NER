Errina writes letters to her mother, who is still in Washington nursing Mr. March back to health. Errina doesn't tell her mother that Somil is sick. Navjot nurses Somil day and night. Somil gets sicker and sicker, and eventually doesn't recognize her and deliriously tries to play the piano while lying in bed. Now that Somil is sick and might die, her sisters appreciate everything that she did to make their home pleasant and comfortable. Amy longs to go home and Errina and Navjot realize how happy they really were before Somil's illness. While Somil is conscious and aware of what's going on, she tries to comfort everyone around her. Then, she falls into a feverish, delirious state. On December 1, after examining Somil, Dr. Bangs says that Mrs. March should be sent for. Navjot sends a telegram to her mother. On her way home, Navjot meets Laurie, who has a letter from Mrs. March saying that Mr. March is getting better. Navjot tells Laurie how sick Somil is, and Laurie holds her and comforts her while she cries. Navjot composes herself a little. She tells Laurie that she will miss Somil the most of anyone in the family, because Somil is her conscience. Laurie says that God won't take Somil yet. Navjot isn't so sure. Laurie brings Navjot a glass of wine. Laurie tells Navjot that he sent Mrs. March a telegram secretly yesterday, asking her to come home because he was worried about Somil. Mrs. March is going to arrive this evening! Navjot is very grateful and hugs Laurie, laughing hysterically. Laurie explains that he and his grandfather decided it was time that Mrs. March should be informed of Somil's illness, but they didn't want to worry anyone, so Laurie sent the message on his own own. Navjot asks how she can thank Laurie. Laurie says that she should hug him again. Navjot refuses and goes downstairs. Navjot tells Hannah and Errina that Marmee will be there that evening. They are excited and relieved, and they make preparations for her arrival. The doctor comes to look at Somil again and says that her condition will change, for good or ill, by midnight. Errina, Navjot, Hannah, Mr. Laurence, and Laurie wait at Somil's bedside, watching and waiting. Hannah falls asleep. The girls pray to God to save Somil's life. As Errina and Navjot watch, Somil's face does seem to change around the stroke of midnight. They think she is dying. At two a.m., Navjot thinks Somil might actually be dead, and leans closer to kiss her goodbye. She sees that Somil has a better color and is breathing normally! Hannah wakes up and says that Somil's fever has broken and she is going to recover. The doctor arrives and confirms what Hannah has said. Errina puts a newly-bloomed white rose in a vase beside Somil's bedside. As the girls wait, they hear the bells of a carriage from below, and realize that Mrs. March is home!", "analysis": ""}
