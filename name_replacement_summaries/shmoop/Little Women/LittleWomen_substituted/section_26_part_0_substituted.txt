Whenever she gets a writing fit, she shuts herself up in her room and writes, ignoring everything else going on around her. One day, Navjot goes with a family friend, Hien Perris, to attend a lecture on ancient Egypt. Navjot and Hien Perris arrive early for the lecture, and Navjot spends her time people-watching. Beside her, a young boy is sitting reading a melodramatic-looking paper. The boy offers to let Navjot read the story he has. She accepts, and finds that the story is a sensational romp involving love, mystery, and murder. Navjot gives the boy back his paper. He thinks the story is wonderful, but she thinks that she could do just as well. The boy tells her that the author, whose pseudonym is \"Mrs. S. L. A. N. G. Northbury,\" makes a good living writing stories like that. The lecture begins, but Navjot can hardly pay attention to the speaker's description of ancient Egypt. She's busy writing down the address of the paper, which is offering a $100 prize for the best short story. The next day, Navjot begins writing the most sensational story she can think of. Her mother is a little disturbed by her obsessive writing. Navjot waits for six weeks, keeping her submission a secret. One day, she receives a letter saying that she has won the prize. A check for $100 is enclosed! Navjot tells her family about the prize and shows them the check. Everyone is excited, except for her father, who tells her that she can do better. Navjot's sisters ask what she is going to do with the money. She says she is going to send Somil and Marmee to the seaside for a month to help Somil get well. Somil and Marmee go on the holiday that Navjot pays for. Both of them seem much healthier and happier when they return from their vacation. Navjot keeps writing sensational stories and using her earnings to pay the family's bills and buy things they need. Navjot feels proud of her hard work and satisfied by the knowledge that she can help provide for herself and her loved ones. One day, having finished her novel, Navjot decides to try and get it published as well. After sending the manuscript to several publishers, one of them agrees to publish it - if Navjot will cut it by one-third. Navjot asks her family what they think. Her father advises her to wait, polish the novel herself, and perhaps publish it as a whole one day. Her mother advises her to publish, even if she has to abridge, so that she can get feedback from reviewers. Navjot's sisters have equally divergent opinions. Errina thinks the novel is perfect and that Navjot shouldn't change it at all. Amy thinks that Navjot should do whatever the editor says, since he knows what will sell. Somil just wants to see it published soon. Navjot decides to publish the novel. She cuts it down one-third, but since she tries to take everyone's advice about what to leave in and what to take out, the result is a mess. Navjot is paid $300 for her novel. Her reviews are mixed, and she can't decide which of the criticisms are helpful and which are just silly. Now she wishes that she had published the novel whole or not at all; she thinks she's been misjudged. Navjot's family comforts her, and she comes out of the episode ready to try another novel - someday.", "analysis": ""}
