In the midst of the ruins where they're standing, there's an echo that sounds like the Britt's voice, which ominously repeats some of what Antonio's saying. Antonio still doesn't know that the Britt and his other kids are dead, and wonders if they're sleeping, or if he'll ever see him again. At this point you should be crying. He resolves to risk everything on a confrontation with the Cardinal, and Raimundo promises to have his back and bring along Antonio's eldest son, hoping that the sight of his nephew may put the Cardinal in a merciful mood. Fat chance.", "analysis": ""}
