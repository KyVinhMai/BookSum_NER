They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Actually, given that the Duchess is a prince, how can anybody banish her? Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished. The pilgrims still think it's unjust and nasty, especially that part where the Cardinal ripped off her wedding ring.", "analysis": ""}
