He is at Wallack's Theater for a performance of The Shaughraun. He really loves one of the scenes in this play. In the scene, the male lead leaves the female lead. She is turned away from him. Without her noticing, he kisses a black ribbon she is wearing around her neck and leaves. For some reason that night, this scene reminds Newland of his parting from Madame Olenska the last time he saw her. Afterwards, he is thanked by both Mrs. Welland and Mrs. Manson Mingott. They are pleased that Ellen had decided not to go through with the divorce. In the next box, he notices Madame Olenska sitting with the Beauforts, Lawrence Lefferts, and Mr. Sillerton Jackson. He goes over and Madame Olenska quietly asks him if he thinks the male lead will send the female lead some yellow roses. Newland is surprised. He had sent her yellow roses again without signing his name on the card. Madame Olenska asks Newland what he does while May is away in St. Augustine . Newland says he works. Beaufort barges in on the conversation, so Newland leaves the box. Newland thinks over a letter he received from May, in which she asked him to look after Ellen.", "analysis": ""}
