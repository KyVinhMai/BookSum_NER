Mrs. Welland steps out in order to convey that they are going to decline the invitation, and May goes for a ride with her father. When the day of the Sillerton party arrives, Archer decides to see the Blenkers' home. The Blenkers, the Marchioness, and Madame Olenska will all be in town for the Sillerton party. With the Blenker home empty, Newland can see where Madame Olenska is spending all her time. When he arrives at the Blenker house, it is empty. He starts roaming around the grounds and notices a pink parasol in the summer-house. He thinks it's Ellen's, so he gives the handle a kiss. As he sits in the summer house, he hears a rustle of skirts and thinks it's Ellen. It isn't. It's one of the Blenker girls, and the parasol belongs to her. Archer is disappointed. The Blenker girl tells Archer that Ellen had been called away to Boston the day before on business. Archer politely extricates himself from the conversation and leaves for home.", "analysis": ""}
