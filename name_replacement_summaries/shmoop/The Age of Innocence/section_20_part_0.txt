Archer and May are in Newport, Rhode Island, to spend their summer vacation. On this day, Archer watches May perform in an archery competition at the Beauforts's country home. Everybody from New York society is there. Archer is surprised to meet the Marchioness there. The Marchioness informs him that she and Madame Olenska are staying with the Blenkers's. The Marchioness also talks about her continued fascination with Dr. Carver. When May steps up to take her turn, Lefferts admires her form but Beaufort dismisses her. Archer is insulted by Beaufort's comment. May wins the competition and receives a shiny diamond pin. May and Archer head over to Mrs. Manson Mingott's after the archery competition. Archer is surprised to learn that Madame Olenska is visiting Mrs. Mingott at the same time. Mrs. Mingott sends Archer to get Madame Olenska, who is taking a walk outside. Archer finds Madame Olenska standing on a the end of a pier, facing the sea with her back to him. Archer decides that if she turns around by the time a boat crosses the Lime Rock lighthouse, he will go down to her. She does not turn around. Archer goes back up to the house with the excuse that he couldn't find Madame Olenska. On the way home, May wonders whether Madame Olenska would be better off with her husband. Archer thinks this idea is cruel. Archer lies awake thinking about Madame Olenska all night.", "analysis": ""}
