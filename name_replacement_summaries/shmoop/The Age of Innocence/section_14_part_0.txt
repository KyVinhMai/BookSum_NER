On Saturday he spends all day with them and their guests. On Sunday he heads out for Skuytercliff to see Madame Olenska. When he arrives, the butler tells him that Madame Olenska has left with Mrs. van der Luyden for church, and Mr. van der Luyden is napping. Newland walks out to meet the women as they walk back. He's pleased to see that only Madame Olenska is walking down the road. Mrs. van der Luyden has gone off to Rhinebeck to visit some aunts. Newland and Madame Olenska go to a small old house on the grounds that used to belong to Mr. van der Luyden's ancestor. Newland tries to get Madame Olenska to tell him what she's running away from. In the course of their conversation, Newland turns his back on her in order to look out the window. He fantasizes about her throwing her arms around him. Instead, he sees Mr. Beaufort walking toward the house. Madame Olenska is dismayed to see Mr. Beaufort, but Newland calls out to him to let him know where they are. Mr. Beaufort and Madame Olenska head to the main house while Newland heads back to the Chivers's. On Monday he takes a train back to New York City and thinks over the events of the past weekend. That evening he is unpacking his books and decides to read a book of poems, The House of Life. Three days pass. On the fourth day he gets a note from Madame Olenska, who wants to explain about the past weekend. Newland thinks it over all night, then the next morning packs up a suitcase and hops a boat to St. Augustine.", "analysis": ""}
