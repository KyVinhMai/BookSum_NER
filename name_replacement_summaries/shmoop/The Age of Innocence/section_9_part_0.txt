Those wild and crazy kids. Newland tries to convince May to get married soon, but May says her mother insists on a long engagement. The next afternoon, Newland is smoking in his study before dinner, instead of hanging at the club like he usually does. His sister Janey comes in with the scandalous news that Madame Olenska was seen at Mrs. Struthers's with the Duke and Mr. Beaufort. Scandalous, because Mrs. Struthers is considered \"common.\" Sophy Jackson has arrived to discuss the matter with Mrs. Archer, and Sillerton Jackson is off discussing the matter with Mrs. van der Luyden, before he comes over to the Archers's to do the same thing. Newland thinks Janey and the rest of the family are being ridiculous. He confesses that he knew that Madame Olenska planned on attending Mrs. Struthers's party with the Duke and Mr. Beaufort, and Janey doesn't understand why he didn't stop Madame Olenska. Next, he sees his mother in the drawing room; his mother is equally shocked and thinks that Madame Olenska has offended Mr. van der Luyden by acting in a vulgar way. His mother wants Newland to take her to see Mrs. van der Luyden. Suddenly, the butler announces that Mr. van der Luyden has arrived for a visit. When Mr. van der Luyden enters, he tells them all that he's just been to see Madame Olenska. He's not offended: he thinks she's charming, but he did give her a warning about traipsing around town in unfashionable places like Mrs. Struthers's home.", "analysis": ""}
