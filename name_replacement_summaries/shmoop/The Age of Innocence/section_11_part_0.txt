On the way, he sees many members of New York society who are also in the process of making various visits, including Mr. Beaufort, who is climbing into his carriage. Newland imagines that Mr. Beaufort is off to visit his mistress or in some other disreputable pursuit. Newland arrives at Madame Olenska's to the unpleasant surprise of... Mr. Beaufort, who is chatting with Madame Olenska when Newland walks in. Mr. Beaufort tries to convince Madame Olenska not to visit the van der Luydens and have fun with some performer types at a dinner he's giving. He invites Newland as well. Mr. Beaufort leaves. Newland then tells Madame Olenska that he works for Mr. Letterblair's firm. He advises her not to go through with the divorce because of the scandal it might cause, particularly if the stuff in her husband's letter were made public. Madame Olenska agrees. Newland kisses her hand and leaves.", "analysis": ""}
