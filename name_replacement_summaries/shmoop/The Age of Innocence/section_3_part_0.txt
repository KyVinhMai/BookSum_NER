They are accompanied by Mrs. Welland. The first visit up is to Mrs. Manson Mingott. May shows off her sapphire engagement ring. During their visit, Countess Olenska enters, followed by Julius Beaufort. With their arrival, Archer and the Wellands get up to leave, and Countess Olenska walks with them to the door. Archer apologizes for neglecting to tell Countess Olenska about their engagement, and she's totally okay with it. On the ride home, they talk about everything but Countess Olenska, which means, of course, that they are all thinking about Countess Olenska. Everyone is a bit scandalized that Countess Olenska is traipsing around town with the married Julius Beaufort.", "analysis": ""}
