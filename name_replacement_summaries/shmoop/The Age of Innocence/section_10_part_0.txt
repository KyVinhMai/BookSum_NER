Mr. Letterblair calls Newland into his office and announces that the Mingotts want Newland to advise on Madame Olenska's divorce. Newland really doesn't want to be involved because of his connection to May, but Mr. Letterblair insists. The family doesn't want Madame Olenska to divorce but Madame Olenska wants a legal opinion. Mr. Letterblair hands Newland some papers to consider. Newland reviews the papers, which contain some correspondence between Madame Olenska's lawyers and the Count's, as well as a letter from the Count to Madame Olenska. He heads home and sends a note to Madame Olenska, asking if he can meet with her. She agrees to a meeting later that evening since she is leaving for the weekend for the van der Luydens's country home. He then heads to dinner with Mr. Letterblair. Mr. Letterblair is surprised Newland is taking Madame Olenska's request for a divorce seriously, despite the potential for scandal. Newland tells him that he would like to speak with Madame Olenska first before he gives an opinion.", "analysis": ""}
