Madame Olenska lives in a bohemian neighborhood that isn't as stylish as the neighborhoods where everybody else in Archer's circle lives. Madame Olenska isn't in, but her Italian maid asks him to wait in her drawing room. Soon, Newland sees Madame Olenska arrive outside with Julius Beaufort. She and Julius speak, and then Julius leaves in his carriage. Madame Olenska enters the house and greets Newland. They have a conversation about how maze-like New York society can be. Madame Olenska finds all the social rules overwhelming and even cries a little. This makes Newland uncomfy. The Duke of St. Austrey arrives along with Mrs. Struthers. Newland takes his leave. Newland stops by his florist's. He's forgotten to send May the lilies-of-the-valley that he sends her every day. He also sees some yellow roses, which he sends to Madame Olenska, but without a card with his name.", "analysis": ""}
