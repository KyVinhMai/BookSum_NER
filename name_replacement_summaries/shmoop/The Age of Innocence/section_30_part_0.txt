He watches Madame Olenska leave the Beauforts's house, then walks up to her and asks her to meet him at the Museum the next day. They meet at the Metropolitan Museum the next day at 2:30 in the afternoon and wander over to the Cesnola antiquities. There, once again, Archer tries to convince Ellen to run away with him. She refuses and then suggests that she come to meet him once alone, presumably for love-making, before she returns to her Count. Otherwise, she couldn't bear to stay and hurt everybody with their affair. Archer agrees, and they agree to meet the day after tomorrow. When Archer arrives home, May isn't there, so he sits in the library to think things over. When May enters, she tells Archer that she had a long talk with Ellen and decided that Ellen isn't such an awful person after all. They get up to get ready for a dinner date. May embraces Archer and reminds him that he hasn't kissed her yet today.", "analysis": ""}
