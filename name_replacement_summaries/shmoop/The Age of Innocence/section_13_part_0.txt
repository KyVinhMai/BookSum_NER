They walk out together. Newland discovers that Ned Winsett lives in Madame Olenska's neighborhood. In fact, Madame Olenska had helped Winsett's son when he cut his knee. The next morning at work, Newland is bored. He sends a note to Madame Olenska to see if he can come by for a visit. No reply from Madame Olenska. The next day there is still no reply. Finally, on the third day, he receives a note from her. She's staying with the van der Luydens at their country home, Skuytercliff. She says she is running away from something, but she doesn't say what. Newland is bummed out. He has just declined an invitation to visit the Reggie Chivers's at their country home, which is close to Skuytercliff. He changes his mind and decides to visit them.", "analysis": ""}
