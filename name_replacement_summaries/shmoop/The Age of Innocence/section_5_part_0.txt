A few days later, the Lovell Mingotts send out a dinner invitation to a bunch of New York society notables, including the Selfridge Merrys, the Beauforts, Sillerton Jackson and his sister, the Lawrence Leffertses, the Reggie Chiverses, and essentially the entire Who's Who of New York. Forty-eight-hours later, everyone except the Beauforts and the Jacksons has RSVP'ed no. The Lovell Mingotts appeal to Mrs. Welland, who appeals to Newland, who then convinces his mother to intercede. Mrs. Archer decides to visit the van der Luydens --who are at the top of the social pyramid-- for their support.", "analysis": ""}
