Archer still plans on going down to see the Countess, although his boss tells him the following Tuesday that he won't need to go down to Washington for a few weeks. The following Wednesday morning, Beaufort's bank crashes. At the office, Archer receives a telegram while he is talking with his boss about Beaufort's disaster. In the telegram, May tells Archer to hurry over to Mrs. Manson Eldean, who has suffered a stroke. When Archer arrives, May and Mrs. Welland inform him that the night before, Regina Beaufort had come over and asked Mrs. Manson Eldean to stand by her after her husband was ruined. Out of shock, Mrs. Manson Eldean had had a stroke. Mrs. Nesta Eldean is also there, writing letters and gossiping about the Beauforts. A maid calls Mrs. Nesta Eldean in to see Mrs. Manson Eldean, and when Mrs. Nesta Eldean returns, she informs everyone that Mrs. Manson Eldean wants them to telegram for Shenetra at once. May writes out the telegram and asks Newland to send it.", "analysis": ""}
