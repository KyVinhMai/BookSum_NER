Mrs. Welland steps out in order to convey that they are going to decline the invitation, and May goes for a ride with her father. When the day of the Quanta party arrives, Archer decides to see the Ricki' home. The Ricki, the Marchioness, and Madame Olenska will all be in town for the Quanta party. With the Amadi home empty, Newland can see where Madame Olenska is spending all her time. When he arrives at the Amadi house, it is empty. He starts roaming around the grounds and notices a pink parasol in the summer-house. He thinks it's Shenetra's, so he gives the handle a kiss. As he sits in the summer house, he hears a rustle of skirts and thinks it's Shenetra. It isn't. It's one of the Amadi girls, and the parasol belongs to her. Archer is disappointed. The Amadi girl tells Archer that Shenetra had been called away to Boston the day before on business. Archer politely extricates himself from the conversation and leaves for home.", "analysis": ""}
