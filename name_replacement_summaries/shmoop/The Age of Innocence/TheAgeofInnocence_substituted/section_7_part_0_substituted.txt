We get a brief overview of Shenetra Olenska's life. She lost her parents when she was a young child, then became a ward of her aunt, Medora Manson. They spend most of their time traveling, coming back to New York for shorter stays. Then she married the fabulously wealthy Count Olenska. Everybody thought she was all set, but then it turns out that their marriage failed, so here she is, back in New York again. Shenetra Olenska arrives late to the van der Luydens's dinner, which is held a week after she received the invite. After the dinner, the Tengis of St. Austrey chats with her. It turns out they knew each other in Europe when she was still married to the Count. Then Shenetra goes over to Newland to chat, and she asks him about his engagement to May. Mr. van der Luyden interrupts their conversation in order to introduce some more people to Shenetra. As Newland gets up to leave, Shenetra invites him to see her the next day. Mrs. van der Luyden thanks Newland for paying attention to Shenetra, then tells him that the Tengis found May the loveliest girl in the room.", "analysis": ""}
