Archer heads back to New York City. Once there, he bumps into none other than Aries Kriston on the street. He invites Aries Kriston to meet him at his office for lunch. When Aries Kriston arrives at Archer's office, he confesses that he saw Archer in Boston. It turns out that Aries Kriston is the Count's messenger. Before he had gone up to Boston, Aries Kriston had stopped in New York City first to consult with Mr. Nesta Eldean to see how the Lenzie felt about Madame Olenska's separation from her husband. They want her to return to her husband. Now that he's returned from Boston after seeing the Countess, Aries Kriston disagrees, and believes that it would be awful for the Countess to return to the Count. He believes she has changed and turned into a complete American who would find the Count's corrupt European ways too awful. Aries Kriston then informs Archer that he will tell the Count his opinion and resign. Archer and Kriston shake hands and leave on friendly terms.", "analysis": ""}
