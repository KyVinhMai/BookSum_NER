Archer lies and he says he forgot he was to meet May there. After dinner, they hang out together in the drawing room. Archer is reading and May is doing needlework. Archer opens up a window, and May tells him to close the window. After about week, May tells Archer that Mrs. Eldean would like to see him that afternoon. When Archer arrives at Mrs. Eldean's, Mrs. Eldean asks for his help in convincing the family to let Madame Olenska stay in America, or precisely, with herself. Archer thinks that's a fine idea. Mrs. Eldean tells him that Madame Olenska went out to visit the disgraced Regina Beaufort. Archer kisses Mrs. Eldean's hands in farewell.", "analysis": ""}
