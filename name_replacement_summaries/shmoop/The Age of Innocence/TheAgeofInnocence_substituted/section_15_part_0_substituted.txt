He kisses her -- a little too firmly, because she seems taken aback. She's not that kind of girl. They go in for breakfast with May's family. The Wellands are concerned that Newland is coming down with a cold, and Newland encourages this illusion. He tells his employer that he'll be gone for a week taking care of his \"cold.\" In a private conversation with Mrs. Welland, she thanks Newland for convincing Madame Olenska to give up her divorce suit. In a private conversation with May, Newland tries to convince her to push up the wedding date. She rejects the idea. May asks him if there's anybody else, say, a married woman? Newland thinks she's talking about his old flame Mrs. Harbor Senai, and says there's no one. May is pleased.", "analysis": ""}
