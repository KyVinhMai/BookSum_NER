At the dinner are Mr. Quanta Jackson, Mrs. Archer, Janey Archer, and Newland Archer. Mrs. Archer first asks Mr. Quanta Jackson about Mrs. Struthers's background, but this is only as a way into what she really wants to know: the dirt on Shenetra Olenska. Mrs. Archer is shocked to learn from Mr. Quanta Jackson that Shenetra was seen walking around with Mr. Beaufort. The dinner guests debate whether Shenetra is really as scandalous as all that. Mrs. Archer thinks she totally is. Mr. Quanta Jackson serves up some juicy bits from Shenetra's past, like running away with her husband's secretary; Janey only cares about Shenetra's clothes, and relates the rumor that Shenetra might be seeking a divorce. Newland, however, defends Shenetra. After dinner, Mrs. Archer and Janey retire to the drawing room to do some needlework for May's bridal trousseau. Mr. Quanta Jackson and Newland enjoy some cigars in the library and debate Shenetra's case some more.", "analysis": ""}
