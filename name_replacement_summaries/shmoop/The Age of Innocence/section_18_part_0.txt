Newland stands at the altar, waiting for his bride, worried that he might have forgotten the wedding ring. It's in his pocket. During the entire ceremony, Newland is in a daze. But he manages to appear cheerful. After the wedding, Newland and May climb into a carriage. May surprises Newland by embracing him in public. Gasp. They head over to the wedding breakfast, which is being held at Mrs. Manson Mingott's house. After the breakfast, they head off for their honeymoon in Rhinebeck. When they arrive in Rhinebeck, the coachman tells them that Miss du Lacs's house is unavailable because of a leak in the water tank. He takes them to the van der Luydens' home at Skuytercliff instead. May is thrilled with the change in plans. Of course, Archer is stunned because he associates Skuytercliff with meeting with Madame Olenska there.", "analysis": ""}
