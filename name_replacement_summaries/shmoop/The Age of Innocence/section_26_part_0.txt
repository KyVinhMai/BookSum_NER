Archer still plans on going down to see the Countess, although his boss tells him the following Tuesday that he won't need to go down to Washington for a few weeks. The following Wednesday morning, Beaufort's bank crashes. At the office, Archer receives a telegram while he is talking with his boss about Beaufort's disaster. In the telegram, May tells Archer to hurry over to Mrs. Manson Mingott, who has suffered a stroke. When Archer arrives, May and Mrs. Welland inform him that the night before, Regina Beaufort had come over and asked Mrs. Manson Mingott to stand by her after her husband was ruined. Out of shock, Mrs. Manson Mingott had had a stroke. Mrs. Lovell Mingott is also there, writing letters and gossiping about the Beauforts. A maid calls Mrs. Lovell Mingott in to see Mrs. Manson Mingott, and when Mrs. Lovell Mingott returns, she informs everyone that Mrs. Manson Mingott wants them to telegram for Ellen at once. May writes out the telegram and asks Newland to send it.", "analysis": ""}
