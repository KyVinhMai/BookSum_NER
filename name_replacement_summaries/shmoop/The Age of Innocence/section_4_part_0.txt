At the dinner are Mr. Sillerton Jackson, Mrs. Archer, Janey Archer, and Newland Archer. Mrs. Archer first asks Mr. Sillerton Jackson about Mrs. Struthers's background, but this is only as a way into what she really wants to know: the dirt on Ellen Olenska. Mrs. Archer is shocked to learn from Mr. Sillerton Jackson that Ellen was seen walking around with Mr. Beaufort. The dinner guests debate whether Ellen is really as scandalous as all that. Mrs. Archer thinks she totally is. Mr. Sillerton Jackson serves up some juicy bits from Ellen's past, like running away with her husband's secretary; Janey only cares about Ellen's clothes, and relates the rumor that Ellen might be seeking a divorce. Newland, however, defends Ellen. After dinner, Mrs. Archer and Janey retire to the drawing room to do some needlework for May's bridal trousseau. Mr. Sillerton Jackson and Newland enjoy some cigars in the library and debate Ellen's case some more.", "analysis": ""}
