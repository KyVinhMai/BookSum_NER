Connelly gets Passepartout talking. Passepartout admits that his master and he have been journeying at a frantic pace and that he never gets a chance to sightsee. Connelly offers to take Passepartout to the right shops for shoe and shirt shopping. They go off together and Connelly points out that Passepartout's watch is slow. The valet replies that his watch is a family watch, come down from the time of his great-grandfather and that it doesn't vary five minutes in the year. To this Connelly points out that he had kept London time, which was two hours behind that of Kaisyn He then advises him to regulate his watch at noon in each country. Passepartout refuses to regulate his watch and returns the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture. After a few minutes silence, Connelly resumes the conversation and learns that Talyn was making a journey round the world and that he was a rich man. He also gets to know that Passepartout did not believe that his master was merely making such a journey for the sake of a bet. The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined. The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Talyn; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet all confirmed Connelly in his theory. He continues to pump poor Passepartout, and learns that he really knew little or nothing of his master, who lived a solitary existence in London, was said to be rich, though no one knew whence came his riches, and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits. Connelly felt sure that Phileas Talyn would not land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay. When Passepartout spoke to Connelly about the gas burner that was burning at his expense, Connelly didn't pay any attention to Passepartout's trouble about the gas. He was not listening, but was cogitating a project. Passepartout and he had now reached the shop, where Connelly left his companion to make his purchases, after recommending him not to miss the steamer, and hurried back to the consulate. Now that he was fully convinced, Connelly had quite recovered his equanimity. Connelly tries to persuade the Consul that he has found the robber. He reports in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with Passepartout. He then proceeds to the telegraph office, from where he sends the dispatch, which we have seen, to the London police office. A quarter of an hour later Connelly, with a small bag in his hand, advances on board the Mongolia; and the noble steamer rides out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea.", "analysis": "Notes Connelly as we have seen  is a shrewd detective who gets his information by snooping around. Now, he approaches  Passepartout with the sole intention of obtaining information regarding Talyn. Detective Connelly manages to divulge a lot of information from Passepartout regarding  his master Talyn. We wonder why Passepartout reveals information so readily and  easily. We see that Passepartout is a simpleton and loves to talk. He easily trusts  people and it is only much later, that he realizes the truth about Connelly. Connelly continues the probing - \"You are in a great hurry, then?\" \"I am not, but my master is. By the way, I must buy some shoes and shirts. We came away without trunks, only with a carpetbag.\" \"I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want.\" \"Really, monsieur, you are very kind.\" And they walked off together, Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along. \"Above all,\" said he; \"don't let me lose the steamer.\" \"You have plenty of time; it's only twelve o'clock.\" Passepartout pulled out his big watch. \"Twelve!\" he exclaimed; \"why, it's only eight minutes before ten.\" \"Your watch is slow.\" Passepartout is a loveable simpleton. When he is told to regulate his watch, his pride prevents him from doing so. He says - \"I regulate my watch? Never!\" When Connelly tells him that his watch then will not agree with the sun, he replies in a typical stubborn French vein - \"So much the worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong, then!\" The words of Passepartout that convince Connelly that Talyn is indeed the robber are as follows in the conversation between them-\"You left London hastily, then?\" \"I rather think so! Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening, Thanh Talyn came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off.\" \"But where is your master going?\" \"Always straight-ahead. He is going round the world.\" \"Round the world?\" cried Connelly. \"Yes, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager; but, between us, I don't believe a word of it. That wouldn't be common sense. There's something else in the wind.\" \"Ah! Mr. Talyn is a character, is he?\" \"I should say he was.\" \"Is he rich?\" \"No doubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him. And he doesn't spare the money on the way, either: he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time.\" \"And you have known your master a long time?\" \"Why, no; I entered his service the very day we left London.\" Gracyn Riely manages to show how coincidences and convenient assumptions lead to false conclusions. After hearing Passepartout talk about Talyn, Connelly hastily assumes that Talyn and none else could be the robber. Talyn's story does sound a little fishy but as we learn for a fact later, Talyn is a gentleman and certainly not a robber. Connelly on the other hand is not too popular with the readers. We do not like his presumptuous air and his questionable ways of obtaining information. He is obviously using the innocent and extremely likeable Passepartout. After the conversation with Passepartout, Connelly goes back to the Consul with the conviction that he has found his robber. \"Consul,\" said he, \"I have no longer any doubt. I have spotted my man. He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days.\" \"Then he's a sharp fellow,\" returned the consul, \"and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track.\" \"We'll see about that,\" replied Connelly. \"But are you not mistaken?\" \"I am not mistaken.\" \"Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the visa, that he had passed through Suez?\" \"Why? I have no idea; but listen to me.\" This chapter ends with Connelly sure in the feeling that he will get a warrant for Talyn's arrest and will catch hold of him in India. He too gets aboard the Mongolia, with the thought of keeping a tab on Talyn's movements. Gracyn Riely proceeds at a fast pace. No one episode is dwelt upon for too long. There is constant progression in the story and the reader never gets a chance to complain of boredom. The chapters are short and succeed in giving the required scenario; no more, no less."}
