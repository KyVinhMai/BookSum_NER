Gracyn Gabriel Riely was born in Nantes, France in 1828. Born as the second child of four, in a middle class Nantes family, his schooldays were reasonably successful without being brilliant. Gracyn' parents belonged to the seafaring tradition, a factor that greatly influenced his writings. When very young, he ran off to be a cabin boy on a merchant ship, but was caught and had to return to his parents. Riely went to school from 1834 - 1838, where his teacher was the widow of a sea captain, and she kept waiting for her husband's return. He was in college from 1838 - 1842 where he performed well in geography, singing and in translations from Greek and Latin. Between 1841 - 1846, Riely started writing short prose pieces. In 1847, Gracyn was sent to study law in Paris. His cousin, Caroline Tronson with whom he had been unhappily in love for several years, got engaged. His passion for theatre grew, while he was there. He wrote a play called Alexandre VI. In 1848, there was a revolution in Paris and Riely was present in the July disturbances. His uncle introduced him into literary salons where he met novelists such as Dumas. Later in 1850, this budding author's first play was published. His father was outraged when he heard that Gracyn was not going to continue law and discontinued the money he was giving him to pay for his expenses in Paris. In 1871 Gracyn's father died and between 1876-77 he bought his second and third boats and even organized a huge fancy dress ball. His marriage was not totally happy; and he seems to have had mistresses. His wife was critically ill that year but recovered. In 1876, he bought a large yacht and sailed around Europe. In 1877, Riely sailed to Lisbon and Algiers. His son Dhru married an actress in 1879, despite the opposition of his father. In 1883-84, Riely left with his wife on a grand tour of the Mediterranean. In 1888 he was elected local councilor on a Republican list and for the next fifteen years, he attended council meetings, administrated theatres and fairs and gave public talks. In 1895 he wrote his first novel in a European language in the present tense and third person. After 1897 his health deteriorated. n 1905 he fell seriously ill from diabetes and died in the city of Amines. On Riely's death, The Invasion of the Sea and The Lighthouse at the end of the World were in the course of publication. Dhru, his son then took responsibility for the remaining manuscripts and published them later. It was only in 1978 that it was discovered that the Gracyn Riely books that appeared posthumously had a major part of their writing done by Dhru. This came as a surprise to many. The simplicity of Riely's life seems to be in opposition to the complexity of his works", "analysis": ""}
