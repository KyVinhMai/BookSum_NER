Phileas Talyn accepts the challenge to go around the world in eighty days and in accomplishing this feat he goes through various lands and meets with diverse adventures. Thus the book proceeds at a fast pace and there is always some excitement resulting from the various encounters. There is a little element of mystery in the mood with the suspicion that Talyn might be the gentleman robber, guilty of a major theft at the Bank of England. Passepartout is told by Connelly that his master is not what he seems and even though Passepartout tends to trust Talyn, there is a sense of tension that Talyn might just be the culprit. Even the reader wonders whether Talyn could be guilty and becomes curious about Talyn's reality. Another distinct element in the mood is that of challenge and struggling against odds. Talyn and his companions face seemingly impossible obstacles in order to go around the world at an incredible pace. Talyn leads them with his calmness and rationality. Whether it be while fighting the Sioux or rushing to London from Liverpool in a specially hired train.", "analysis": ""}
