After eleven days, the General Grant reaches San Francisco.", "analysis": "Notes The journey on the ship General Grant is related  after we are told what transpires, when John Bunsby signals the larger ship. Verne  manages to interpolate various episodes, the past and the present neatly and systematically. So all the gaps in the story are bridged. The reader gets to know exactly how  Fogg, Aouda and Fix reach Yokohama. At Yokohama, Fogg takes extreme pains to locate  Passepartout, one can see that the master is genuinely anxious about his valet,  though he may not express it so openly. Aouda on the other hand is very open about  her affection for Passepartout. Once, the two parties are reunited Fogg shows  that he can be large hearted and forgiving. He does not reprimand Passepartout  for getting intoxicated at Hong Kong. He merely gives him some money quietly for  clothes. We know that Passepartout respects Fogg greatly. We now learn that Aouda's  affection for Fogg is deepening into love. This romantic interest in the novel  seems natural and does not seem contrived. We can understand how a young beautiful,  helpless princess can fall in love with a calm efficient and handsome man of the  world. However we do not know how Fogg feels as he rarely expresses his emotions. Passepartout understands Aouda's heart and hopes the best for her. In this chapter too a little space is devoted to the depiction of the ship and its passengers. This is necessary in order to create an authentic background. The detective Fix is not doing too well. His warrant of arrest for Fogg has expired and he now has to follow the man all the way to England. Fix is clever and manages to convince Passepartout that he will be aiding Fogg to reach England early. It's a pity that Passepartout trusts Fix so easily. In Verne's otherwise compact and believable story, the relation between Fix and Passepartout seems a little anomalous. We wonder why Passepartout does not reveal Fix's true intentions to Fogg but we see how this step then contributes to the growth and development of the plot. Passepartout and Fix agree to be allies. Fogg finally reaches San Francisco and has so far neither gained nor lost a single day."}
