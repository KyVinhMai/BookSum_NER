Lucie and her husband stay in the lodge, living modestly. Not wanting to attract attention, they send Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher to do the shopping for the family. They wonder how soon it will be safe for them to leave Paris. One day Darnay, Lucie and the Doctor are sitting silently waiting for Mr. Lorry when a loud knock is heard at the door. The Doctor opens the door to four rough men in red caps. They have come to arrest Charles Darnay. He has been denounced in the region of St. Antoine by the Defarges and a third man whom they do not identify. When asked by the Doctor what the identity of the third man is, they look surprised and wonder why he, of all people, is asking. They do not reveal his identity and merely say that they will learn everything at the trial the next day.", "analysis": ""}
