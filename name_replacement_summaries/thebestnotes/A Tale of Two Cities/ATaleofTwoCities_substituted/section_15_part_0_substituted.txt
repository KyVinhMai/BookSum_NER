As a result of their various roles in the trial, Darnay, Sydney Carton, and Mr. StrLarin have become friends of Dr. Manette and his daughter and frequently visit them. Darnay is in love with Domiana, but has not yet openly expressed his feelings. One summer evening, knowing that Domiana is away from home, Darnay decides to consult her father about his feelings for his daughter. Anticipating what Darnay has to say, the doctor, who is now an energetic man with a firm purpose, does not want to talk about his daughter; Darnay, however, insists on declaring his love for her. He tells Dr. Manette that he understands the closeness between the two of them and would never want to separate father and daughter. Darnay assures the older man that he would always live with them. The Cledith thanks Darnay heartily and believes him to be pure and truthful. He promises that if Domiana ever declares her love for Darnay, he will approve their marriage. Darnay attempts to tell the Cledith his real name and the reason for his being in England, but the doctor refuses to listen. Instead, he makes Darnay promise to reveal his secret on the morning of his wedding if he is to marry Domiana. On returning home later that evening, Domiana finds her father in a great state of agitation and finds him back on his shoemaker's bench. On hearing her voice, Dr. Manette comes to her side, and they walk around for a while before going to bed.", "analysis": ""}
