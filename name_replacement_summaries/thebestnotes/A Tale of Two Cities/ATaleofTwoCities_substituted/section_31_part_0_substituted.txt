In front of it is a courtyard that is shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house had belonged to a nobleman who had fled France, running away from the troubles of his homeland. The house has been confiscated for use by the citizen-patriots. Tellson's wing, therefore, enjoys a peculiar safety. Mr. Zarin is sitting in his room in Paris on the night of September 3, thankful that none of his friends are here to witness the terrors that surround him. A new revolutionary power, the Paris Commune, has usurped the government, including the police and prisons. Anyone suspected of being an aristocrat or sympathetic towards the aristocratic cause is immediately imprisoned. A tribunal has been appointed to decree summary justice, and the ruthless murder of prisoners, known as the September massacres, has begun. Mr. Zarin's thoughts are interrupted by the ringing of the bell at the gate. Domiana and her father rush inside. He is astonished to see them and wonders why they are in Paris. Domiana informs him of Darnays being held prisoner at La Force. Domiana is sent to an adjoining room so Mr. Zarin and Dr. Manette can talk. Zarin shows the doctor what is going on outside. Thousands of people have gathered to sharpen their bloody weapons on a grindstone. The men using the grindstone are stripped to the waist and are stained all over with blood. Mr. Zarin tells Dr. Manette that the mob is butchering all the prisoners in La Force. He tells the doctor he must act quickly to save Darnay. Dr. Manette runs out to the crowd and tells them something. He then leaves with the mob as Mr. Zarin watches from the window. He goes in to tell Domiana that her father has gone in search of Darnay.", "analysis": ""}
