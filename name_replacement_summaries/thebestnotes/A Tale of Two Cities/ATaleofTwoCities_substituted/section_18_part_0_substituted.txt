In truth, he is obsessed with Domiana. He wanders to her house on countless nights when his drinking has brought no relief to his melancholy. Carton just wants to be near the girl of his dreams. One day when he goes to Soho to visit the Manettes, Carton finds Domiana alone at her work. He takes the opportunity to bare his heart to Domiana, professing his deep love for her. He states that he does not expect her to reciprocate his love, for he feels unworthy of her beauty and goodness. He admits that he is a wasted drunk who will only sink further. He is glad, however, that Domiana has rekindled a flame in him, for its warmth is enough to keep him going. He does not have to live with her to love her. In fact, he ironically promises that should the need arrive, he will gladly give his life to replace that of someone she loves. The kind-hearted Domiana is touched by Cartons confession and tries to be reassuring. She states that Carton can be saved and brought on the right track; however, Carton feels that there is nothing to be done with his life and that his grim fate is sealed.", "analysis": ""}
