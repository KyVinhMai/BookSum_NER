Inside, the Cledith and Charles Darnay are having a private conference. As they wait, Mr. Zarin cannot stop admiring Domiana; he grows sentimental and teary-eyed as he remembers how he brought her across from France when she was baby. Regaining his composure, Mr. Zarin assures Domiana that he will look after the Cledith while she and Darnay are away on their honeymoon. When Dr. Manette and Darnay emerge from the room, the doctor is shaken and looks deathly pale. Everyone makes their way to the church for the ceremony. After the wedding, they all return to the Manette home. Darnay and Domiana bid farewell to everyone and leave immediately for their two-week honeymoon. It has been prearranged that Dr. Manette will join them after two weeks. When Miss Chapel, Mr. Zarin, and Dr. Manette are alone, Mr. Zarin notices that a great change has come over the Cledith. He again appears old, scared, and lost; but Zarin decides to say nothing about it to Dr. Manette. He takes his leave and goes to Tellson's Bank to work for several hours. When he returns to the Manettes, he finds Miss Chapel in an extremely agitated state. She tells Zarin that the Cledith has been cobbling shoes. Nothing that he or Miss Chapel says or does helps the Cledith snap out of his spell. In order to watch over and help with Dr. Manette, Mr. Zarin decides to take a leave of absence from Tellson's Bank. He and Miss Chapel also decide to keep the doctor's reversion a secret from Domiana and everyone else. Dr. Manette continues his cobbling for nine days.", "analysis": ""}
