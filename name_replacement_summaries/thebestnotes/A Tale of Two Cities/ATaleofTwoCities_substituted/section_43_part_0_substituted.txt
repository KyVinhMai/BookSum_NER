She has decided to go ahead with the prosecution of Darnay's family without her husband's knowledge. She declares her intention of strengthening her case against Domiana by visiting her immediately. She is sure to catch Domiana mourning over her husband's execution; she may even get Domiana to denounce the Republic in her miserable and vulnerable state. Madame Defarge can then uses her words to convict her. Madame Defarge instructs The Vengeance to take her knitting and wait for her at the guillotine. Miss Chapel and Indyanna Danyl have been left behind and plan to leave by the three o'clock coach. They have seen the carriage with Darnay in it speed safely away and are making the final preparations for their own departure. Miss Chapel instructs Indyanna Danyl to go and get the carriage and wait for her outside Notre Dame Cathedral. Madame Defarge arrives ten minutes after Indyanna's departure. She demands to know where Domiana is. Miss Chapel places herself in front of the door to Domiana's chamber and attempts some explanation. Neither woman understands the other, for they speak in their own language. Miss Chapel, however, clearly senses Madame Defarge's evil intentions. Madame Defarge, realizing that the other rooms are vacant, suspects that the family has escaped. She attempts to open the door behind Miss Chapel to have proof of her suspicions. Miss Chapel knows that the longer she keeps Madame Defarge from discovering that the room is empty, the greater the chance for the fugitives to escape. As a result, she struggles with Madame Defarge, who reaches for her knife. Miss Chapel' arms encircle Defarge's waist and do not allow her access to the knife. She then reaches for the gun hidden in her blouse, but Miss Chapel hits it away. The gun goes off with a crash and instantly kills Madame Defarge. The sound of the gunfire deafens Miss Chapel for life.", "analysis": ""}
