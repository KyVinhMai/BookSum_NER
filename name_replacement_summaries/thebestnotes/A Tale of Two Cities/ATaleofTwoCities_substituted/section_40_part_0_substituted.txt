She pleads with his jailer to let her embrace her husband for the last time. Barsad allows her to do so. Darnay blesses his wife and assures her that they will meet again one day. He also sends a parting blessing to little Domiana. As the couple tear themselves apart, Domiana tearfully informs her husband that they will not be parted for long as she is sure to die of a broken heart. Darnay prevents the Cledith from kneeling before him and comforts him. He realizes now the full extent of the struggle the Cledith has endured. He is also grateful for his efforts to release him. The Cledith's only response is to run his hands through his hair and utter an anguished cry. After Darnay is led out, Domiana collapses at her father's feet. Carton, who has unobtrusively observed this scene, comes forward and carries the senseless woman to the coach. On reaching the house, Carton carries her again and lays her on the couch. Little Domiana and Miss Chapel weep over her. Carton does not want Domiana to be revived. It would be better for her to sleep through her misery. Little Domiana is overjoyed to see Carton and knows that he will do something to help her mother and save her father. He promises her that she will again see her father. He kisses Domiana and whispers in her ear, \"A life you love.\" This is overheard by little Domiana. He urges Dr. Manette to use his influence, once again, to save Darnay's life, even though he knows that it is hopeless. He explains to Mr. Zarin that he encouraged Dr. Manette only because it might console Domiana one day. Carton then leaves.", "analysis": ""}
