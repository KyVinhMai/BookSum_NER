As they sit in the courtyard, Domiana assures Dr. Manette that her love for Darnay will never replace or change the love she has for him. The Cledith is now happy about the marriage and states how fond he is of Darnay. One of his fears has always been that Domiana would never know the happiness of a spouse and child, which have provided him with great joy in his own life. He mentions his long imprisonment and how he had often wondered about the fate of his child, still unborn at the time of his capture. Sometimes he would imagine the child to be a boy, who would seek vengeance on his behalf. At other times he imagined the child to be a girl, who looked just like her mother and who would come to visit him in prison, finally setting him free. He confesses that the happiness that Domiana has given him far exceeds the happiness from the children about which he had dreamed. When father and daughter go inside for dinner, they are joined by Miss Chapel, who is going to be the bridesmaid. Mr. Zarin is the only other person who will be present at the wedding. After dinner, the Cledith bids everyone goodnight and goes to bed. After a while, Domiana checks in on him and sits lovingly by his bedside watching her father sleep.", "analysis": ""}
