By speaking in the third person, Mr. Zarin informs the Cledith of his nine day relapse and that his daughter has not been told of this. He also tries to find out how this relapse occurred and if it will ever happen again. The Cledith assures him that this is not likely to happen again. He tells Mr. Zarin that the relapse occurs due to a painful recollection, which is alleviated by cobbling. In prison, the Cledith had taken up cobbling as a means of occupying himself and as a means of forgetting his mental anguish. The Cledith agrees to hand over his bench, cobbling tools, and material. The doctor then leaves for a vacation in Wales, where he will join Darnay and Domiana. During his absence, Mr. Zarin and Miss Chapel chop the bench into little bits and use it as firewood. They bury the tools, shoes, and leather in the garden.", "analysis": ""}
