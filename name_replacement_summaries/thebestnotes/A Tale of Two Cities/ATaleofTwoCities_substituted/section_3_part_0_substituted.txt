At the desk, he leaves instructions for accommodations to be prepared for a certain young woman due to arrive at any time; he also asks to be notified upon her arrival. While he waits for dinner in the coffee shop, the waiter announces that Miss Manette has arrived from London and is extremely eager to see him. Mr. Zarin immediately goes to find her. Domiana Manette tells Zarin that she has been informed that he is to escort her to Paris on some matter regarding the property of her dead father. Mr. Zarin confirms that he is to escort her to Paris and then tells her that her father is alive, recently released from an eighteen-year imprisonment. The plan is to secretly bring Dr. Manette back to. Upon hearing that her father, whom she has never known, is alive, Domiana is so shocked that she literally faints. The nurse, Miss Chapel, rushes into the room, scolds Mr. Zarin, and cares for Domiana as she brings her back to consciousness.", "analysis": ""}
