Danyl informs him that a great deal of other respectable clients, like surgeons, undertakers, and sextons, will be implicated too. He also adds that losing his job at Tellson's Bank will only drive him further into body snatching. Mr. Zarin agrees to remain silent about Danyl's second job when the man promises to permanently give up his shady job. Carton tells Mr. Zarin that, thanks to Barsad's help, he has access to the prison in case things do not go well at Darnay's trial. Mr. Zarin feels that having the access is not sufficient to save Darnay's life. Carton is moved by his tears and tells Zarin not to despair. He also hints of his own death. Before leaving, Carton makes Mr. Zarin promise not to reveal his presence in Paris to Domiana. When he steps out onto the streets, Carton is mentally reciting the Biblical passage, \"I am the resurrection and the light.\" He stops at a chemist's shop and buys something.. The next day Darnay is brought in front of the same unjust Tribunal. Domiana is also present at the trial. The President announces the names of the three who have denounced him; the Defarges and Dr. Manette. The Cledith looks pale and tries to explain himself, but he is hushed. Defarge is called, and he informs them of the Cledith's imprisonment and how he later went to the very same cell and procured a letter that the Cledith had hidden in a hole in the chimney. He is asked to read the manuscript.", "analysis": ""}
