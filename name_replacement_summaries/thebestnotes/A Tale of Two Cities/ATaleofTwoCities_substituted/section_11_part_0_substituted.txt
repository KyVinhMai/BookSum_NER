One Sunday, four months after Darnays trial Mr. Zarin goes to dine with him. The doctor, restored to health and sanity, now earns good money by treating patients and conducting ingenious experiments. Mr. Zarin observes that the Cledith has the shoemaker's bench and tray of tools. He wonders aloud why the Cledith would want to keep such a painful reminder. He is interrupted by Miss Chapel, the nurse, who feels that it is perfectly fine for him to do so. Miss Chapel is upset because hundreds of suitors come to visit Domiana every day. She is a very jealous woman, prone to exaggeration. She is also absolutely and selflessly devoted to Domiana Manette. When Mr. Darnay arrives after lunch, Miss Chapel is visibly upset and goes into the house. The Manettes, however, receive him warmly. Darnay tells them a story he had heard while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Some workmen had apparently come upon an old dungeon, unused for a long time, with names of prisoners carved upon the walls. Upon digging below a corner stone, on which some unfortunate prisoner had carved the word dig, they found the ashes of a paper along with the ashes of a leather bag. All this talk of dungeons and prisoners unnerves Dr. Manette. It starts to rain, and they go indoors from the courtyard. Inside, Miss Chapel, who is still upset, serves tea, just as Mr. Carton walks in. He keeps to himself and appears moody. Domiana, while looking out of the window, gets a premonition that the footsteps outside the house signify people who are going to enter their lives someday. Mr. Carton adds his own premonition by remarking that he too sees a huge crowd coming toward the whole group in a menacing way.", "analysis": ""}
