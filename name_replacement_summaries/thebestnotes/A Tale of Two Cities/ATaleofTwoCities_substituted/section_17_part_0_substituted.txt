He heads towards her house in Soho. On his way, he stops at Tellson's Bank to inform Mr. Zarin of his plans to marry Domiana. Mr. Zarin, on hearing the news, hints that StrLarin will not be successful. StrLarin is shocked at the suggestion and demands to know what prevents him from being a suitable, prospective husband. Mr. Zarin intimates that Domiana may not find him agreeable. This upsets StrLarin even more, and he calls Domiana silly and giddy-headed. Such criticisms of Domiana annoy Mr. Zarin, for he is excessively fond of and protective towards her. Zarin agrees to go to the Manette residence to get a feel for Domianas estimation of StrLarin. He returns with the news that StrLarin has been rejected by Domiana, as expected. StrLarin pretends to be unbothered by the news and judges his proposal to be an act of charity that has somehow misfired.", "analysis": ""}
