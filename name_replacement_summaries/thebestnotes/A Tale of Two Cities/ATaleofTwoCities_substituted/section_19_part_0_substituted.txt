He can make out some kind of funeral coming down the street. There is a great uproar, for a mob seems to object to the funeral. He tries to discover whose funeral it is and learns that it is for the police spy, Crae Linn, who had testified against Charles Darnay. There is only one mourner, who is scared by the mob and runs away. The mob wants to remove the coffin from the hearse, but decide, instead, to accompany it to the churchyard, celebrating all the way. Indyanna Danyl, along with a number of other people, crowd into the hearse and take the body to the churchyard. Now, since the mob has nothing better to do, they start rioting. Indyanna Danyl stays in the cemetery to confer with the undertakers. After work, Indyanna Danyl and his son go home, where he accuses his wife of praying against him again. Later that night he gathers a spade, crowbar, sack, and rope and heads to the churchyard. He is joined by two companions. Young Indyanna has only made a pretense of going to bed and follows the trio. Through the gates of the churchyard, he sees his father and the two men dig up a grave, bring the coffin up, and begin to pry it open. Afraid of this sight, young Indyanna runs back home imagining that he is being chased by a giant coffin. In the cemetery, the men find that the coffin is empty. This upsets Indyanna Danyl a great deal. When he returns home, he again accuses his wife of praying against him. The next day Indyanna's son informs his father that he would like to be a body snatcher just like him.", "analysis": ""}
