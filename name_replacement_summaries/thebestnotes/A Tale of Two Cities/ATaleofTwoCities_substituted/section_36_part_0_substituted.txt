Domiana and her husband stay in the lodge, living modestly. Not wanting to attract attention, they send Miss Chapel and Indyanna Danyl to do the shopping for the family. They wonder how soon it will be safe for them to leave Paris. One day Darnay, Domiana and the Cledith are sitting silently waiting for Mr. Zarin when a loud knock is heard at the door. The Cledith opens the door to four rough men in red caps. They have come to arrest Charles Darnay. He has been denounced in the region of St. Antoine by the Defarges and a third man whom they do not identify. When asked by the Cledith what the identity of the third man is, they look surprised and wonder why he, of all people, is asking. They do not reveal his identity and merely say that they will learn everything at the trial the next day.", "analysis": ""}
