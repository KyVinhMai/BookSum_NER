It is an old-fashioned, small, ugly, and somewhat decrepit building. Appropriately, all the employees that are seen in the bank are old men; and they are very conservative. Tellson's Bank is a strong supporter of the death penalty and has caused the death of many offenders Jerry Cruncher, the messenger seen previously in Chapter 2, is an odd-job man at the bank. He is usually found working outside the old building during business hours, unless he is out on a bank errand. He is helped by his son, young Jerry, who is simply a smaller version of his father. In this chapter, Jerry Cruncher is at home lying in bed. He is angry with his wife and throws the boot at her saying that her prayers are like curses against him and his son. After grumbling a bit he gets up, polishes his boots, readies himself, and sets out to work with young Jerry. He has been called to the bank by one of its messengers.", "analysis": ""}
