Inside, the Doctor and Charles Darnay are having a private conference. As they wait, Mr. Lorry cannot stop admiring Lucie; he grows sentimental and teary-eyed as he remembers how he brought her across from France when she was baby. Regaining his composure, Mr. Lorry assures Lucie that he will look after the Doctor while she and Darnay are away on their honeymoon. When Dr. Manette and Darnay emerge from the room, the doctor is shaken and looks deathly pale. Everyone makes their way to the church for the ceremony. After the wedding, they all return to the Manette home. Darnay and Lucie bid farewell to everyone and leave immediately for their two-week honeymoon. It has been prearranged that Dr. Manette will join them after two weeks. When Miss Pross, Mr. Lorry, and Dr. Manette are alone, Mr. Lorry notices that a great change has come over the Doctor. He again appears old, scared, and lost; but Lorry decides to say nothing about it to Dr. Manette. He takes his leave and goes to Tellson's Bank to work for several hours. When he returns to the Manettes, he finds Miss Pross in an extremely agitated state. She tells Lorry that the Doctor has been cobbling shoes. Nothing that he or Miss Pross says or does helps the Doctor snap out of his spell. In order to watch over and help with Dr. Manette, Mr. Lorry decides to take a leave of absence from Tellson's Bank. He and Miss Pross also decide to keep the doctor's reversion a secret from Lucie and everyone else. Dr. Manette continues his cobbling for nine days.", "analysis": ""}
