He heads towards her house in Soho. On his way, he stops at Tellson's Bank to inform Mr. Lorry of his plans to marry Lucie. Mr. Lorry, on hearing the news, hints that Stryver will not be successful. Stryver is shocked at the suggestion and demands to know what prevents him from being a suitable, prospective husband. Mr. Lorry intimates that Lucie may not find him agreeable. This upsets Stryver even more, and he calls Lucie silly and giddy-headed. Such criticisms of Lucie annoy Mr. Lorry, for he is excessively fond of and protective towards her. Lorry agrees to go to the Manette residence to get a feel for Lucies estimation of Stryver. He returns with the news that Stryver has been rejected by Lucie, as expected. Stryver pretends to be unbothered by the news and judges his proposal to be an act of charity that has somehow misfired.", "analysis": ""}
