They notice his resemblance to Darnay and assume that he cannot understand them. They continue their argument. Madame Defarge wants the Doctor, Lucie, and the child to be guillotined. Defarge, however, draws the line with Darnay. She tells the Vengeance and Jacques Three how on the day that the Bastille fell, Defarge discovered the letter in Dr. Manette's cell. She had then revealed to her husband that the family mentioned in the letter is her own and that she is the surviving sister. She wants revenge and has doomed in her register the entire Evremonde family. She is not to be stopped. From this conversation and from what the spy Barsad tells him, Carton realizes that Madame Defarge will not stop until she kills Lucie and her child. Since she has seen Lucie signaling to Darnay in prison, she will use this as evidence of a plot to rescue her husband. Furthermore, Lucie will surely mourn for her husband and it is a capital offense for anyone to mourn for or sympathize with a victim of the guillotine. Carton relates his fears to Mr. Lorry and asks him to keep in his possession all their passports including his. He plans to visit Darnay and explains that he should not carry his papers as it would be dangerous. He instructs Mr. Lorry to make arrangements for the homeward journey and to have the carriage waiting for him at Tellson's Bank until two o'clock. In the meantime, the Doctor has tried, in vain, to save his son-in-law. He returns home demented and asks for his shoemaker's bench.", "analysis": ""}
