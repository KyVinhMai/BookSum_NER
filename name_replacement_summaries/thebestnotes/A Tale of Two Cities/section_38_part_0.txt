Cruncher informs him that a great deal of other respectable clients, like surgeons, undertakers, and sextons, will be implicated too. He also adds that losing his job at Tellson's Bank will only drive him further into body snatching. Mr. Lorry agrees to remain silent about Cruncher's second job when the man promises to permanently give up his shady job. Carton tells Mr. Lorry that, thanks to Barsad's help, he has access to the prison in case things do not go well at Darnay's trial. Mr. Lorry feels that having the access is not sufficient to save Darnay's life. Carton is moved by his tears and tells Lorry not to despair. He also hints of his own death. Before leaving, Carton makes Mr. Lorry promise not to reveal his presence in Paris to Lucie. When he steps out onto the streets, Carton is mentally reciting the Biblical passage, \"I am the resurrection and the light.\" He stops at a chemist's shop and buys something.. The next day Darnay is brought in front of the same unjust Tribunal. Lucie is also present at the trial. The President announces the names of the three who have denounced him; the Defarges and Dr. Manette. The Doctor looks pale and tries to explain himself, but he is hushed. Defarge is called, and he informs them of the Doctor's imprisonment and how he later went to the very same cell and procured a letter that the Doctor had hidden in a hole in the chimney. He is asked to read the manuscript.", "analysis": ""}
