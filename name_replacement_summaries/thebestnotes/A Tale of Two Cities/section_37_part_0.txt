They make a few purchases and turn into a wine shop. Miss Pross is startled to see her brother Solomon. Jerry Cruncher recognizes him as John Barsad, the police spy. Sydney Carton arrives in the shop and tells Miss Pross that John Barsad is now a spy among the prisoners. When Carton suggests that Barsad should accompany him to Mr. Lorry's house, the spy, knowing that Carton has too much information against him, relents. Carton informs Mr. Lorry of the re-arrest of Darnay and states that the Doctor's influence is not likely to save Darnay again. Carton, however, says he has made plans, which he refuses to divulge to anyone. He gives strict instructions that Dr. Manette, by using his influence, should procure papers for himself, Lucie, and the child. Barsad is at first unwilling to aid Darnay's friends, but he is reminded that Carton has a great deal of information against him which could have him denounced as an enemy of the Republic and send him straight to the guillotine. As a result, Barsad agrees to help.", "analysis": ""}
