Looking at the jury and the onlookers, he feels as though the usual order has been reversed and that now the felons are trying the honest men. The men in the courtroom are armed with various weapons while the women are wearing knives and knitting. Darnay notices Defarge and his wife; she has a spare piece of knitting under her arm and whispers into Defarge's ear. At first, the onlookers seem hostile towards Darnay, but they respond favorably when they hear that he is married to Dr. Manette's daughter. They are sympathetic to the Doctor and appreciate the work he does. Because of this, their attitude towards Darnay changes from hostility to sympathy. With Dr. Manette's testimony, Gabelle's letter as evidence, and the sympathy of the crowd, Darnay is released. As he leaves, the crowd follows him. They are jubilant, rejoicing, and dancing the Carmagnole; they lift Darnay up and carry him home. Along the way, Darnay looks for the Defarges, but they are nowhere to be seen. At first, he is a bit apprehensive about what is happening and imagines himself to be heading toward the guillotine. This feeling soon passes. Once he reaches home he hugs everyone, kisses his wife, and carries her upstairs. Lucie prays thankfully.", "analysis": ""}
