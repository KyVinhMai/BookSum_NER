The clerk gives him a note that he is supposed to pass to Mr. Lorry by way of the doorkeeper of the courthouse. The case being tried that day is for treason. The punishment is that the guilty be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Jerry Cruncher thinks the punishment is barbarous. Due to the nature of the trial, a large crowd of spectators has gathered outside the Old Bailey. Jerry Cruncher makes his way quietly through the crowd to the door of the courthouse and hands the note to the doorkeeper, as instructed. A few minutes later the door opens allowing him to squeeze in. The doorkeeper takes the note to Mr. Lorry, who is seated amidst some gentlemen in wigs. Not far away sit two more wigged gentlemen. One is Mr. Stryver, counsel for the prisoner, while the other is Mr. Sydney Carton, who sits with his hands in his pockets staring at the ceiling. Jerry Cruncher manages to catch the attention of Mr. Lorry who nods and signals to him to wait there. The prisoner is brought in. Everyone turns to look at him except Sydney Carton, who continues to stare at the ceiling. The prisoner is a young man of about twenty-five, good-looking, and obviously a gentleman. He is dressed plainly in dark colors, and his hair is gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck. He is self-possessed, bowing to the judges and standing quietly. He looks around the room, and his eyes rest on two witnesses, a young woman of around twenty-five and a gentleman who evidently is her father. The father looks remarkable due to the whiteness of his hair and the intense look on his face, like a man who is absorbed with his own thoughts. The daughter has one hand drawn through his arm and the other pressed upon it.", "analysis": ""}
