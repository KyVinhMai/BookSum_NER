Lucie arranges her Parisian household as if her husband were there in hopes that he will soon appear. She also lives in fear. Every day she sees the tumbrels loaded with the condemned on their way to the guillotine and prays that Darnay is not included. Every day she and little Lucie would walk to the prison, hoping to catch a glimpse of Darnay. She is informed by her father that Darnay sometimes catches a glimpse of her standing outside. Next to the prison is a woodcutter's shop, and the road-mender from earlier in the novel is the wood sawyer. Lucie is at first scared of him, but she still talks to him and offers him drinking money. One day, there is a crowd rejoicing, as if there were a festival. A mob wildly rushes around the prison in a Revolution Dance called the Carmagnole. Lucie is frightened as the mob passes and is relieved to see her father standing protectively over her. He tells her that Darnay is to be brought to trial the next day. He also says that because of the activity it will be safe for her to signal Darnay. As Lucie gives her signal, Madame Defarge walks by; it is a bad omen. Lucie and her father go to give Mr. Lorry the good news about Darnay. Mr. Lorry has a visitor that he does not want them to see, so he hurries the person into the next room before receiving the Manettes.", "analysis": ""}
