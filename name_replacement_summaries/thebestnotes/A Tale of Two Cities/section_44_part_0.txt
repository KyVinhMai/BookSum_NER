Carton stands at the back of the third tumbrel with his head bent down, trying to ignore the roar of the crowd. He talks to the young and frightened seamstress while holding her hand. He notices that in front of the guillotine, seated in chairs, are a large number of women knitting. One of the most noticeable women is The Vengeance; she looks frantically around in search of Madame Defarge. The first tumbrels arrive, and the guillotine starts crashing. The women count each head as it is held up. The third tumbrel arrives, and Carton steps down, holding the hand of the seamstress. He places her with her back to the guillotine; she looks bravely into his face and thanks him for his kindness. Carton kisses her as she heads for the guillotine. He then follows in a calm and victorious mood. As he goes to his death, Carton has a vision that all the revolutionaries will follow him to the guillotine. He also envisions the Darnay family living happily, making the sacrifice of his wasted life very worthwhile. Carton is also pleased to think that he will always be remembered and honored by the Darnays. His last thought comes to full fruition when Lucie and Darnay name their son in honor Carton.", "analysis": ""}
