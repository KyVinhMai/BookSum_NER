Shortly after arriving, he gets an assignment with Mr. Kimbro, a very loud and angry man. He learns to mix chemicals into paint to make it white. However, Mr. Kimbro does not explain everything properly, and the narrator ends up making batches of useless gray paint. After he finishes correcting his work by adding a darker paint, he is sent back to the main office where he is assigned another position in the plant, as Lucius Brockway's assistant. Lucius Brockway does not really want an assistant, fearing that personnel is trying to replace him from his job. He accepts this young man, since the narrator does not appear threatening. His first assignment is to read the gauges in the basement. Mr. Brockway talks a little more about himself and the company before the narrator leaves to take his lunch in the break room, where he is stopped by members holding a union meeting. Fearing he is a traitor, they hassle him. Eventually, he has lunch and returns to the basement. Mr. Brockway threatens to kill him when he hears that he encountered a union meeting. They engage in a physical fight, until Mr. Brockway gives in. Then Mr. Brockway leaves the scene laughing when the narrator loses control of a machine. There is an explosion of machine parts, which fall on him, and the narrator loses consciousness.", "analysis": ""}
