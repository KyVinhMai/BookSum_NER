At one point, he is unexpectedly approached by a woman, who invites him for coffee and asks him to help her with her ideological problems. At her home, he is shocked by her wealthy lifestyle and wonders if she is not trying to buy off some of her guilty conscience with Brotherhood donations. However, she is consciously and overtly feminine in her behavior and appears very interested in learning about the Brotherhood. She serves wine and explains that she wants to adopt a new philosophy in order to replace the emptiness in her life. She tells him that although he makes one feel very secure with his ideology, he also makes her feel afraid. He is shocked by her word choice until she clarifies that she thinks he is very forceful and powerful. He explains that the power is in the organization. She tells him that she feels compelled to respond to his speech whether or not she understands his meaning. The narrator becomes aware of their physical closeness and hesitates, but she urges him to continue to speak. When a bell rings, he gets up to leave, but she asks him to stay. She explains it is only the phone and that her husband is in Chicago. She begins touching his biceps as she speaks to him. He feels many different emotions, wanting to stay, wanting to be violent, fearing people are about to walk into the room with cameras. In the end, he stays and they have sex. Later, he is awakened by a man in the hallway, who looks into the room where the two lovers are and calmly announces his arrival before retiring to his own room. The narrator is frantically scared. He finds his clothing in the dark and is too afraid to awaken the woman. He sneaks out of the house quietly. He cannot figure out why the man did not say anything about his presence. It is again as if he is invisible. Although the narrator fears he will be caught with the woman, he continues to see her. One day he is called to headquarters and thinks at once it is about his affair with the white woman. Instead he is told that Tod Clifton has disappeared and the Brotherhood is losing the people of Harlem to Ras and the nationalists. Jack tells the narrator that he must return to Harlem immediately. The narrator wonders what could have happened to Clifton and wishes he had not lost contact with him in the first place.", "analysis": ""}
