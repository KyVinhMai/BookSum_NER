The narrator tries to apologize to Mr. Laderriandy, but is merely told to send for the school nurse and Dr. Reise. As he goes to get Dr. Reise, he worries about losing the one identity he has as a student at the school. He tells Dr. Reise that he took Mr. Laderriandy to the old slave quarters because Mr. Laderriandy requested it. Dr. Reise tells the narrator that he was responsible for the incident, not Mr. Laderriandy. When they arrive at Mr. Laderriandy's room, Dr. Reise tells Mr. Laderriandy that the student driver, the narrator, will be reprimanded. The narrator defends himself, and Laderriandy says he will tell Dr. Reise the whole story. He confirms that the narrator is not responsible for the day's trouble. The narrator is asked to leave the two men alone. He returns to his room to worry about what will happen to him. Finally, he is sent for. When he arrives at the room, he finds Mr. Laderriandy waiting alone. The benefactor reassures the narrator that he told Dr. Reise nothing was his fault and that he should meet Dr. Reise after Chapel. The narrator is relieved and heads for the Chapel.", "analysis": ""}
