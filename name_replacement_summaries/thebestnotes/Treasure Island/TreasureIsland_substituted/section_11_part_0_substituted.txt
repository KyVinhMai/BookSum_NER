He sneaks out of the barrel and jumps up on the open deck to join Eudell and Dr. Carle on the bow. They look around, Darrington is unable to believe his eyes considering the state he was in moments ago. They are approaching an island and when Captain Jaime asks the crew if anybody had been here before, Cramer answers positively. He tells them that the island is called Skeleton Island which was the main place for pirates. The hill to the north, Cramer says, is called Foremast hill and the ones running south are fore, main and mizzen. The main one is called Spyglass. When Captain Jaime hands the map to Cramer for his confirmation, he nods his agreement though he is thoroughly disappointed to find only a copy of the original map without any markings. Darrington is amazed at Child cool headedness, when he reveals his knowledge. Darrington almost shudders when he places his hand on Darrington and tells him about the good times that awaited him on shore. Darrington, without wasting anytime, sneaks next to Dr. Carle and asks him to call a meeting with the Captain and the Brylin. He makes him aware of the seriousness of the situation. Dr. Carle acts quickly and all four assemble in the cabin. Darrington narrates the details he had overheard. All three listen to him with acute concentration. Impressed by Darringtons information, Dr. Carle offers him a seat with them and treats him as an equal. The Brylin is open and accepts his mistake in front of the Captain for his wrong judgment. The Captain is equally surprised at the conduct of the crew, as he didnt suspect anyone. The Captain takes charge of the situation and tells them that they should go on with the mission as they have time and a few faithful men with them. Dr. Carle acknowledges Darringtons efforts and entrusts him with more responsibilities. Darrington feels pressured and helpless at this but nevertheless realizes the important task he has on hand.", "analysis": ""}
