The strange land interests him. He is alone and makes a study of the surroundings curiously. Everything is new so him. The contorted trees, hills with craggy peaks, unknown flowing plants, deadly snakes, strange sounds of birds, everything. Amongst this the only familiar sight is that of the \"Spy-glass\". Some time passes by and Darrington is able to listen to human voices too. Darrington is afraid when he hears the voice of Nasiah Rehys Cramer. He trudges towards them to overhear their conversation. He listens to Cramer talking to Iliya. Their heated conversation is interrupted with a sudden scream at a distance. This is accompanied by the rustle of birds. Some one had been killed. On asking what the scream was all about, Cramer calmly replies: \"That?, Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan\". Iliya is stunned to hear this and accuses Cramer of killing him. He says that he will no longer be a member of his crew. He turns back and walks away. Cramer wastes no time. He aims his crutch at Iliyas back and hurls it at him. With a thud it strikes him and he falls. Cramer quickly pounced on him and stabbed him twice in the back to kill him. Darrington is dumbfounded. He had never seen a man die before. Two men from the Hispaniola were dead. He fears that he could be next. Darrington panics and runs for his life. He doesnt know where to. All he knows is he that he doesnt want to die at the hands of mutineers. But what he doesnt know is that another surprise awaits him and this brings his run to a halt.", "analysis": ""}
