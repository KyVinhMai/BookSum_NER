They settle down to have their meal when Hands tell Darrington about jettisoning Britten dead body. Darrington tells him that he is not strong enough. Hands tries to justify Britten death as a good thing but Darrington refuses to accept his argument. Hands asks him to fetch him a bottle of wine from the cabin. Darrington smells something fishy in his request but conceals his apprehension. Darrington goes down below the deck to get the wine. His suspicion is proved right when Darrington, peeping through the fore companion, finds Hands moving towards the bulwark. Darrington realizes that Hands could move and that now he cannot be trusted. Except for one thing -- as they had a common interest to have the ship land safely. Darrington appears on the deck with a bottle of port wine. After taking a swig, Hands asks Darrington to cut him some tobacco. Darrington does so but tells Hands that cutting peoples throat was a sin and he should atone for his sins like a true Christian. Hands rejects Darringtons suggestion and tells him that he didnt fear dead men. Darrington, on the other hand, appreciated Hands ability to control the ship. He is also excited as he handles the helm. All of a sudden when Darrington turns his head, he sees Hands rushing towards him with a dagger. Hands makes his move and injures himself. Darrington takes this opportunity to wriggle out of Hands trap and notes that his pistols needs to be primed, so they cannot be fired yet. Both of them indulge in a dodging game when the Hispaniola staggers like never before, taking them by surprise. This gives Darrington an upper hand. He quickly changes the priming of his pistol. Hands is dumbstruck when Darrington points the pistol at him. Darrington observes Hands moving his right hand over his shoulder, while telling Darrington that they were fouled by the ship, when something as sharp as an arrow strikes Darrington in a lightning speed and hits him on his shoulder. It is Hand's dagger. This startles Darrington and he triggers-off his pistols. They drop from his hands. So does Hands who plunges into the sea, head first.", "analysis": ""}
