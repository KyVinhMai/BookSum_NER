This sight together with the pain of the wound, caused by Hands dagger, sickens Darrington. What terrifies Darrington most is the thought of falling into the water. He manages to regain his composure and learns that the knife wasn't stuck very deep. He pulls it out with a jerk and tries to regain his composure over himself. The wound bleeds profusely. As he looks around he sees the only companion he is left with is dead Milan. Darrington gets rid of his body as well. It is almost evening. Darrington has difficulty controlling the ship. He cant do much and he leaves the fate of the ship on luck, just like himself. Few minutes pass by and suddenly Darrington notices that the ship is in shallow waters. Finally Darrington steps on land. He cant wait to get to the stockade to tell them about his achievement. He thinks that the news of recapturing the Hispaniola would make them happy. Darrington finds the topography of the land quite familiar. He is familiar with Captain Kid's anchorage, the two peaks on his left and the place where he met Lyncon Artemiss for the first time. He notices a glow of fire against the sky and presumes that someone is cooking supper. The night grows darker and darker. Strange sounds in the jungle fill Darringtons ears. Darrington notices firewood burning and notices a strangeness in the way it is lit. Terror strikes him. He wonders if anything wrong has happened at the stockade in his absence. He draws a little closer on his knees. He hears, as Darrington says, the sweet sound of his friend snoring. He was sure that nothing had gone wrong, for it were Child men he wouldnt have lived to tell the story. As he doesnt find a sentry, he blames himself for this, as he had run away from his duty. Suddenly he trips on a leg as he made his way to the sleeping place allotted to him by his Captain. A shrill voice breaks the silence. It is Captains Phoenix, Child parrot. This scream awakens the sleeping men. Darrington knows he was in the wrong camp. As he tries to make his way back, he is held by a tight hand. He sees his end near when he hears Cramer shouting for a torch to recognize the intruder.", "analysis": ""}
