Darrington is overjoyed as he gets an opportunity to go outdoors. He finds his way to the Spy-glass and finds a tall, strong, smiling hunk with one good leg and the other cut off close to his hip, cheering the people at the inn. Darrington is relieved to find that Nasiah Rehys is not the same person whom the Captain had feared as he had none of the characteristics of a buccaneer. He appeared to be a very respectable man and did not fit any of the images of a buccaneer that Darrington had imagined in his dreams. Darrington approaches Nasiah Rehys Cramer and hands him the note. Just then he sees a familiar face rushing out of the Spy-glass. Darrington is sure he recognizes the person as Black Dog and he informs Nasiah Rehys Cramer about him. Nasiah Rehys doesnt recognize him. He cross checks with Iliya Morgan, who was drinking with him. But he states that doesnt know him either. Even through Nasiah Rehys doesnt recognize Black Dog by name, he admits that he had see him with a blind man named Kamari. He asks Lyncon to locate Black Dog and tells Darrington that they will keel-haul him. Nasiah Rehys then diverts Darringtons attention and involves him in a conversation. Suddenly he bursts into laughter. Though Darrington joins him, he doesnt get the joke. Later he figures out that Nasiah Rehys is laughing at himself and blaming himself for the loss of money-as Black Dog hadnt paid for his drink-and that he should takes up Darringtons position as a cabin boy in the ship. Cramer gets friendly with Darrington and him that theyll make a good company and they do. Darrington finds him very informative as he talks about various ships and the work taking place on them as they walk down to the hotel where the Brylin is staying. Nasiah Rehys Cramer tells the Brylin about the incident at Spy-glass and departs. He nods an O.K. in a seamans style when he is asked to be on board with the crew by four. Dr. Carle and the Brylin appreciate Nasiah Rehyss personality and proceed towards the ship to make an inspection, along with Darrington.", "analysis": ""}
