He crawls along the bow spirit and makes his way to the deck. He doesnt see anybody on the deck except a bottle tumbling by. The Hispaniola gets a whiff of another wind and it shudders. Darrington gets a glimpse of red cap and Israel Hands lying down in their drunken stupor. The ship rocks recklessly on the sea due to the rough weather. The coracle on which Darrington floated moments ago sinks. The rash movements of the ship, do not disturb the unconscious Red Cap and Hands except that they sink a little with every tumble. Darringtons curiosity is aroused when his eyes fall on splashes of blood around both of them. Darrington wonders if they were both dead. Suddenly he sees Israel Hands move. He moans and positions himself back on the bulwark. Darrington walks boldly to the main mast and welcomes Hands on board. Hands is too weak to say anything and he asks for brandy. Darrington takes this opportunity to rush down to the cellar. He finds some brandy for Hands and picks biscuits, picked fruits, raisins and cheese for himself. He quenches his thirst with fresh water. Hands is struck by thunder when he takes the first swig of brandy. When he asks Darrington where he comes from, Darrington confidently replies that he has come to take possession of the ship and asks Hands to call him Captain. He then pulls down the pirate flag. Seeing Darrington in a better state of health than he is, Hands accepts Darringtons proposal. Knowing that Darrington would like to sail ashore, he offers to show Darrington how to sail in return of some food, water and a bandage for his wound. Darrington accepts the deal on the condition that theyd steer the ship to the North Inlet before high tide. Darrington fulfills Hands request Hands tells him what to do. Soon they sail. Darrington feels elated when Hands addresses him as Captain. Proceeding towards the destination, Darrington finds something strange in Hands demeanor. The way Hands observes Darrington, makes him feel suspicious.", "analysis": ""}
