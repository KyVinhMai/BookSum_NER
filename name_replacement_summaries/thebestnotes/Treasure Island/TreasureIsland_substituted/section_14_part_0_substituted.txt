He cannot tell if it is a man, a monkey, or a bear, but he is terrified. He thinks that he would prefer to die at the hands of Nasiah Rehys Cramer, than some strange creature and retraces his steps to the boat. The figure reappears and Darrington finds the creature running like a man. Darrington suddenly realizes that he had forgotten he has a loaded pistol for his defense. Darrington confidently approaches the man hiding behind the tree trunks. The man comes out into the open and kneels in front of Darrington. The man tells Darrington that his name is Lyncon Artemiss and that he is a Christian. Darrington observes that he is white man. Tanned, ragged and uncouth, he is covered in pieces of an old ships canvas held together with brass buttons and bits of stick. He tells Darrington that he was marooned here three years ago and has not spoken to a man since. He has lived on berries, oysters and goats and that he was yearning for a piece of cheese. He asks Darrington if he has any with him at the moment. Darrington promises him to get it if he gets on board again. Then, Darrington hears the strangest thing from him. Lyncon Artemiss proclaims that he is rich and he will make Darrington rich too. Lyncon Artemiss inquires if the ship anchored here belonged to Captain Phoenix. Darrington tells him that Phoenix is dead but there are Phoenixs men on board. When Darrington mentions Child name Lyncon Artemiss recognizes him. Darrington tells Lyncon Artemiss about his voyage. He tells Darrington that he is a good lad and asks if the Brylin was liberal minded, and would he agree to give him a thousand pounds and a ride back home if he helps them. Darrington said that they were all going to share, so yes. Lyncon Tells Darrington about his voyage with Phoenix while he buried his treasure. At that time he had served as a mate with Donson Larkin and Cramer. He also tells Darrington that he was marooned on the island by a group of other sailors, when he had returned to find the treasure, and failed to find it. To get to the ship, Lyncon Artemiss says that he has made a boat which will help them. Just then they hear the thunder of a cannon and small arms fire. They run for their lives. As they run Lyncon Artemiss keeps on talking about things Darrington couldnt comprehend. Not far away from them they see a Union Jack flutter.", "analysis": ""}
