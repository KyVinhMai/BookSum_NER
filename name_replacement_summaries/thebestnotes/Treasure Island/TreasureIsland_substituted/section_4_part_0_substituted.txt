Hiding behind bushes, Darrington sees seven or eight men running towards the Inn. Darrington spots the blind beggar who orders the men to break down the door to get inside. When the marauders find Donson dead and the sea chest already opened and cleared of its treasure, the beggar concludes that Darrington is responsible and must be nearby. He tells his men to find Darrington and his mother and to destroy the Inn. A whistling sound is heard, like the one Darrington and his mother had heard earlier, upon hearing it, the men stop their activity and quickly prepare to leave. Kamari, the blind beggar, tries to entice them to stay with the treasure that is awaiting them. This doesnt work and much to the relief of Darrington they start quarreling amongst themselves. The men hear the sound of four or five horse riders approaching, then coming into sight in full gallop. The men abandon Kamari and run away. Even with his handicap, the blind man also tries his best to save himself, but he was trampled by the horses and drops dead. Darrington and his mother are saved and are relieved to find Supervisor Dance and his revenue officers making their appearance just in time. With a hope of tracking some men who were stationed at Kitts hole, Mr. Dance goes back, only find that they have already left. Proud that he has captured Kamari, Mr. Dance returns with Darrington to the ruined inn. He asks Darrington what the men were after, Darrington tells him that the secret is safe in his pocket and that he would like to hand it over to Dr. Carle.
