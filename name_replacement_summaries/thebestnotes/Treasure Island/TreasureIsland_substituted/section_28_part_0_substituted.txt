Cramer, by this time, has started talking to Darrington in a friendly tone. Darrington sees the group of buccaneers proceeding towards the stockade. Unlike Darrington, Cramer is hardly concerned. When the door opens, one of the men is pushed ahead to hand over a piece of paper to Cramer. Its the Black Spot again. Cramer condemns their act, as he recognizes the paper as having been cut out of a bible. He taunts Deiren for doing this. At this, Kosmas is furious and asks Cramer to do his part of his duty by reading it. He asks Cramer to step down from his position for a common note. In the heated conversation that followed, Cramer is accused of releasing the prisoners and saving the life of Darrington. Now it is Child turn to lash out at their arguments and prove his superiority. He answers their arguments one by one. Firstly, he accuses Anderson, Hands, Kosmas and Davy Jones for crossing him. He goes on to tell them that they will be better off as tailors than sailors. As for Darrington, he says he is a hostage and killing him would be a waste. He reminds them about the consort. He also reminds them that he was the one who bargained for food without which they would have been, by now, crawling on the floor. Much to their surprise, he then throws the original treasure map in front of them. The men are dumb founded. Cramer gives a final warning to Kosmas and asks him to shut his mouth if he wants to live. To prove his supremacy once again, Cramer asks who the Captain is. Cramer throws the piece of paper to Darrington. The paper contains two verses of the Bible. This is blackened with wood ash which soiled out as Darrington took it in his hand. `Deposed was written on the blank side. Darrington is unable to comprehend any thing. That ends the nights activity. Darrington lies down admiring the remarkable tactics Cramer used to control the mutineers and save his life.", "analysis": ""}
