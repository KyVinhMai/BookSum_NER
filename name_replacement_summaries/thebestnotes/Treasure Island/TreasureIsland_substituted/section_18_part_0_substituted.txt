He tells Darrington that his friends are in control of the stockade. Lyncon Artemiss doesnt join Darrington, instead he asks Darrington to first talk to them about his demand he mentioned earlier and come back to him where Darrington found him first. Their conversation comes to a halt when a cannonball lands ten yards away from them. Darrington moves carefully towards the stockade. From the thicket Darrington could see the Hispaniola. The black flag of the pirates-the Jolly Roger now fluttering on the mast. Darrington lies there for some time observing the destruction the pirates had done to the island. He hears the pirates yelling loudly in a highly spirited mood. Darrington makes it to the stockade. He is welcomed warmly by the crew. Darrington tells them what has happened since he has been on the island. Captain Jaime issues orders for everyone to proceed with their activities. Everybody is given a task. Two are sent to fetch firewood. Two more to dig a grave for Ottie; the doctor serves as the cook and Darrington is appointed as a sentry. The doctor, while cooking, often comes to the door for a breath of fresh air. He inquires about Lyncon Artemiss during these relaxing moments. After learning Lyncon Artemisss craving for cheese, he keeps aside his Parmesan cheese, which he always carried in his snuff box, for Lyncon. They bury Ottie. The food was cooked. After supper the three leaders sit down to discuss their future plan of action. They can hear the sounds of the pirates who are just half a mile away. Darrington dozes off after a long hard day. He is awakened when he hears Cramer shout the flag of truce. It is another day on the island.", "analysis": ""}
