Though Darrington is happy to hear this, he cant face him as he feels ashamed of his conduct. Cramer welcomes the Tomie and tells him that he has a surprise for him. Dr. Carle asks Cramer if it was Darrington. He proceeds to treat his patients without paying much attention to Darrington. He is quite absorbed in his work. After checking on everyone, Dr. Carle asks Cramer if he can speak to Darrington in private. Cramer accompanies Darrington outside and leaves him with the Tomie. The Tomie had a lot to say. He tells Darrington that leaving his crew and running away during the time he was needed most was unkind and cowardly. Darrington weeps at this and tells the Tomie that he had blamed himself enough for it. When the Tomie begs him to escape, he tells him about the word given to Cramer. He tells the Tomie that he had recaptured the ship and briefly describes his adventures. Dr. Carle is delighted to hear this and praises Darrington for his efforts. He asks Cramer not to rush for treasure. Cramer agrees to it. He tells him that he wont, at least not at the cost of his and Darringtons life. Dr. Carle assures him a fair trial after they get back. Cramer is thrilled to hear this. After asking Cramer to take care of Darrington, the Tomie leaves the stockade alone.", "analysis": ""}
