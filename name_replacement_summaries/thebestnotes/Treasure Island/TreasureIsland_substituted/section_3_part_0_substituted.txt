With the Captain dead, the chances of recovering the money are dim though not impossible. They have to act fast before the Black Dog and the blind beggar return and grab it. The thought of staying alone in the inn, with a dead body and the danger of the place being ransacked by the Captains old mates terrify them both, but they are owed money for the Captain's stay in their Inn. Seeking help to protect them from these desperate men, Darrington and his mom approach the people from the town to assist them. Much to their dismay, the village folk not only refuse but also discourage them. The mention of the pirate Captain Phoenix brings fear to those who have heard of him. They relate this within the presence of some strange men on the road. Darringtons mother jeers at the men of the village calling them chicken-hearted and decides that she will undertake the task herself as-Darrington, a now fatherless boy-rightly deserves the money they presumed to be kept in the sea chest. A loaded pistol, a bag from Mrs. Breslin, and saddled horses is the only help offered. No one will assist them. They return to the Inn and are relieved to see the door still bolted, Darrington and him mother enter the inn. He discovers the \"black spot\" when he finds a small piece of paper with a short message. The message, though unclear, gives them some kind of hope as it says that they have until ten that night. Darrington finds the key to the chest hung around the Captains neck. Darringtons mother opens the chest and under a heap of miscellaneous things his mother finds a canvas bag which jingles with coins. Determined to collect only the amount due to them, Darringtons mother begins to count. Soon she realizes that this is a mammoth task as the coins are from different countries. Darrington is terrified when he hears the tapping sound of the blind beggar's walking stick approaching and asks his mother to quickly grab the entire bag. Stubborn as she is, she refuses to take even a dime more than what she deserves. Darrington rushes outside. They hear hurried footsteps approaching them. Sensing the approaching danger, Darringtons mother faints but he manages to drag her to safety in the thick fog as the men approach.", "analysis": ""}
