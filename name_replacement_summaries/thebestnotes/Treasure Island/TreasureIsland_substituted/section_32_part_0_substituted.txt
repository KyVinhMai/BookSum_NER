The treasure for which they had sailed all the way has gone. Cramer is quick to recall to this. He passes a double barrel pistol to Darrington. He asks Darrington to get into cover and cautions Darrington. Darrington hears the buccaneers saying that Cramer had changed sides again. The pirates dig the pit to see if they can find the already unearthed treasure. Morgan finds two gold guineas. Sherman holds it aloft pointing it at Cramer asking him if it is the seven hundred thousand pounds he had promised. Cramer, unperturbed by his taunt, asks them to dig hard to find some pig-nuts. He asks if Kosmas is again attempting to Captain the crew. But by now the crew is against Cramer. Kosmas Sherman gets ready to make a speech. He slowly raises his arm to signal an attack on Cramer when three bullet shots from the thicket hit him. His men flee for life. Cramer gives the final touches to the body as he empties two barrels of pistol into the fallen man. The Tomie, Gray and Lyncon Artemiss appears from the thicket. They think that the other pirates had fled towards the boat. Dr. Carle and the gang follow. Cramer keeps pace with them. They slow down when they find out that the men are not running towards the boat. The Tomie narrates the story of Lyncon Artemiss finding the treasure long ago and that it was safe. He tells them that he had traded the map only after he met Lyncon Artemiss. Cramer thanks his stars to have Darrington by his side. Failing which, the Tomie accepts, he would have been dead. When they reach the sea, they get in a gig boat and make their way to the North Dulet. They see the Brylin standing by Lyncon Artemiss. When they reach the north inlet, they see the Hispaniola cruising by herself. Gray handles the ship alone and after pulling it over to Lyncon Artemisss cave, guarded it the whole night. They enter the cave. Captain Jaime is lying beside the fire and the light from the blaze flickers the pile of Phoenixs treasure. Darrington is dumbstruck to see the amount of wealth accumulated in the form of gold bars and coins. The Captain welcomes Darrington. Cramer is asked what he was up to this time, to which he promptly replies that he is back to his old duty. They sit down and have supper. Darrington recalls this moment as the happiest one he has had in the whole journey.", "analysis": ""}
