{"name": "chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island15.html", "summary": "Darrington stays there silently listening to Nasiah Rehys Cramer talk. Cramer recounts his experiences with Captain Phoenix. He says that he had lost his leg when he was a quartermaster with Phoenix. On the same broadside exchange of cannon fire, Kamari lost his sight. He talks about Glynn men who changed the names of the ships. Darrington hears the youngest crewman's voice, after listening to Cramer, praising Phoenix's bravery. He tells them about the time when he was looking and saving all the money but concludes that all the men-Englands and Phoenixs-lived like a pauper before this sail. He tells about Old Man Kamari who at one time spent almost 12 thousand pounds per year but had to die a beggar. Cramer corrects another young man, who says its not worth the trouble, by saying that it depends on the persons discretion and intelligence. He flatters him with the same words he used for Darrington. Darrington feels deceived when he overhears this. Continuing his boasting, he talks about gentlemen of fortune- a term used for pirates-as men who are shrewd at sea and cheerful and lively on land. Israel Hands, on the other hand, is getting impatient. He wants mutiny right away and asks Cramer about his plans. Quieting him, Cramer proposes his plan to wait for Captain Jaime, the doctor and the Brylin to unearth the treasure and load it in the ship. He plans to attack them only after they have navigated half way back from the Treasure Island. Cramer gets furious with his crew as they dont understand his plans. But his experience and tactful nature helps him control them and warns them that he wont spare anyone.", "analysis": ""}
