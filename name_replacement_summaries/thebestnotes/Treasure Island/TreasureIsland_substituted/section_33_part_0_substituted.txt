Work is allocated for all. Gray and Lyncon go with the boat. Darrington is busy packing the coins. Darrington find them similar to the ones found in Donsony Larkin bag. They belong to all countries. This activity goes on for days. They havent heard from the mutineers for almost 3 days. On the third night, they hear some voices singing. It was the mutineers. Cramer notes that they were drunk. He advises the Tomie not to approach them, for they arent trustworthy like him. On a meeting held on the Island before boarding the Hispaniola, they decide to leave the three mutineers on the island with some leftovers of food, clothing, medicine and tobacco. They begin their journey. Back from the Treasure Island with the Union Jack fluttering on top of the deck. Soon after they at sea. They see the three men marooned in the island begging and pleading to take them back. The Tomie informs them about the supplies they had left for them at the cave. When they see that their requests are rejected, one of them fires at Cramer. He misses him but nevertheless puts everyone else on guard. They sail far from island. They anchor the ship in a port in Spanish America. The sight of Negroes and the Mexican Indians delights them. They go ashore for a while and when they return, Lyncon Artemiss who was alone in the ship informed them that Cramer has escaped. He tells them that he helps him do so only to save the lives of the men on board. The crew is pleased to hear that Child account is settled for three to four hundred guineas in loot. They reach port in Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was beginning to plan the consort. Only five men have returned from the voyage. They share the treasure among themselves. Captain Jaime retires. Gray settles down in life and becomes a mate on a ship he partly owns. Lyncon Artemiss, after spending his money in nineteen days, lived on in the port. They never ever hear of Nasiah Rehys Cramer. The bars of Cramer and the arms -- the remaining treasure still lies on Treasure Island. Darrington says that the voice of the surf hitting the rocks and the parrot, Captain Phoenixs sharp voice `Pieces of eight, pieces of eight still rings in his ears.", "analysis": ""}
