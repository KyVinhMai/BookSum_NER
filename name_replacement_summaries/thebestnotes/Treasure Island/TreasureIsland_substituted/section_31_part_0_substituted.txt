So they rest for a while. Talking in soft tones they discuss Phoenix and his men. Suddenly from the middle of the trees, the famous song of Donsony Larkin are heard. \"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\" Darrington says, he had never seen the six men more terrified. The song stops. Cramer tries to recognize the voice. Once again the voice breaks out. This time, instead of the song it says \"Darby McGrow\". Deiren takes out his Bible and starts praying. But Cramer is still not disturbed. He says that he is here to get the seven hundred thousand pounds from the Island and that he shall get it. This doesnt charge up this crew. Morgan feels that it is the spirits voice and stops Cramer from crossing it. Cramer reasons out that spirits voice doesnt echo and that it is human. Nudging his memory, Cramer cries out that its Lyncon Artemiss. Soon they are back in their original spirits. Without minding the presence of Lyncon Artemiss, they proceed towards the treasure. Deiren is still terrified and Child taunt terrifies him more. They reach the first of the tall trees and then the second and the third. Darrington says the only thing that kept them going was the thought of the seven hundred thousand pounds. Finally they reach the edge of the thicket. Overjoyed, they shout `huzza. All of a sudden Cramer increases his pace. Darrington follows him. They stop when they see the most unexpected sight. The treasure has gone. It has already been excavated and the only thing that is left is the nameplate of Phoenixs ship - WALRUS.", "analysis": ""}
