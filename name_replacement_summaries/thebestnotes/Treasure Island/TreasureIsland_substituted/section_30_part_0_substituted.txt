He praises Darrington for keeping his word, despite the Tomies persistence. He tells Darrington that theyll stick together at all odds. The buccaneers stuff themselves with a roasted ox. Cramer also joins the gang and Darrington sees that he, like any other pirate was gorging on the meal. He keeps on talking about the treasure and their journey back home. All the while Darrington cant decide if Cramer were on his side or the mutineers. Unlike the pirates, Darrington cant enjoy his breakfast as all these thoughts were fighting in his mind. He also wonders about his friends. The treasure hunt begins. Everybody is well armed with their necessary accessories. Picks, shovels, pistols, food and alcohol. Darrington is tied around his waist and the loose end of the rope is held by Cramer. They follow the map looking for the `tall tree, which Captain Phoenix had marked. Cramer leads them. The men move on all fours when they reach the plateau. Suddenly one of the men screams in terror. When they reach the place they see a dead carcass. Cramer observes something strange in the bodys position. On a closer observation, Cramer finds that the body pointed straight in the direction of the Island and the compass reading also matched exactly with the one on the chart. Cramer recognizes the corpse as Allardyce, one of Phoenixs men. Morgan is quick to remember that the man had owed him money and that he had his knife too. Morgan searches for his knife and finds nothing. Cramer reminds them they were six men now just like Phoenixs six men. He tells them that all six of them were dead, today. One of the seamen breaks out into the sea song of Donsony Larkin. This untimely singing disgusts Darrington. They go on with their hunt except that the men stay close to Cramer and speak softly. They fear the dead mans spirits.", "analysis": ""}
