{"name": "chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island15.html", "summary": "Jim stays there silently listening to Long John Silver talk. Silver recounts his experiences with Captain Flint. He says that he had lost his leg when he was a quartermaster with Flint. On the same broadside exchange of cannon fire, Pew lost his sight. He talks about Roberts men who changed the names of the ships. Jim hears the youngest crewman's voice, after listening to Silver, praising Flint's bravery. He tells them about the time when he was looking and saving all the money but concludes that all the men-Englands and Flints-lived like a pauper before this sail. He tells about Old Man Pew who at one time spent almost 12 thousand pounds per year but had to die a beggar. Silver corrects another young man, who says its not worth the trouble, by saying that it depends on the persons discretion and intelligence. He flatters him with the same words he used for Jim. Jim feels deceived when he overhears this. Continuing his boasting, he talks about gentlemen of fortune- a term used for pirates-as men who are shrewd at sea and cheerful and lively on land. Israel Hands, on the other hand, is getting impatient. He wants mutiny right away and asks Silver about his plans. Quieting him, Silver proposes his plan to wait for Captain Smollet, the doctor and the Squire to unearth the treasure and load it in the ship. He plans to attack them only after they have navigated half way back from the Treasure Island. Silver gets furious with his crew as they dont understand his plans. But his experience and tactful nature helps him control them and warns them that he wont spare anyone.", "analysis": ""}
