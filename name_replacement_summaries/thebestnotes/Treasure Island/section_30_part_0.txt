He praises Jim for keeping his word, despite the Doctors persistence. He tells Jim that theyll stick together at all odds. The buccaneers stuff themselves with a roasted ox. Silver also joins the gang and Jim sees that he, like any other pirate was gorging on the meal. He keeps on talking about the treasure and their journey back home. All the while Jim cant decide if Silver were on his side or the mutineers. Unlike the pirates, Jim cant enjoy his breakfast as all these thoughts were fighting in his mind. He also wonders about his friends. The treasure hunt begins. Everybody is well armed with their necessary accessories. Picks, shovels, pistols, food and alcohol. Jim is tied around his waist and the loose end of the rope is held by Silver. They follow the map looking for the `tall tree, which Captain Flint had marked. Silver leads them. The men move on all fours when they reach the plateau. Suddenly one of the men screams in terror. When they reach the place they see a dead carcass. Silver observes something strange in the bodys position. On a closer observation, Silver finds that the body pointed straight in the direction of the Island and the compass reading also matched exactly with the one on the chart. Silver recognizes the corpse as Allardyce, one of Flints men. Morgan is quick to remember that the man had owed him money and that he had his knife too. Morgan searches for his knife and finds nothing. Silver reminds them they were six men now just like Flints six men. He tells them that all six of them were dead, today. One of the seamen breaks out into the sea song of Billy Bones. This untimely singing disgusts Jim. They go on with their hunt except that the men stay close to Silver and speak softly. They fear the dead mans spirits.", "analysis": ""}
