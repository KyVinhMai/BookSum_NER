Though Jim is happy to hear this, he cant face him as he feels ashamed of his conduct. Silver welcomes the Doctor and tells him that he has a surprise for him. Dr. Livesey asks Silver if it was Jim. He proceeds to treat his patients without paying much attention to Jim. He is quite absorbed in his work. After checking on everyone, Dr. Livesey asks Silver if he can speak to Jim in private. Silver accompanies Jim outside and leaves him with the Doctor. The Doctor had a lot to say. He tells Jim that leaving his crew and running away during the time he was needed most was unkind and cowardly. Jim weeps at this and tells the Doctor that he had blamed himself enough for it. When the Doctor begs him to escape, he tells him about the word given to Silver. He tells the Doctor that he had recaptured the ship and briefly describes his adventures. Dr. Livesey is delighted to hear this and praises Jim for his efforts. He asks Silver not to rush for treasure. Silver agrees to it. He tells him that he wont, at least not at the cost of his and Jims life. Dr. Livesey assures him a fair trial after they get back. Silver is thrilled to hear this. After asking Silver to take care of Jim, the Doctor leaves the stockade alone.", "analysis": ""}
