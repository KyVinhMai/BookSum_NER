{"name": "chapter 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island27.html", "summary": "Handling the coracle (Gunn's small boat) was very difficult, though the boat is small and appropriate for a person of his size. He rows the boat with the water currents. He grasps the hawser when he gets closer to the Hispaniola. Suddenly it occurs to Jim that cutting the hawser means cutting free the huge Hispaniola. With her size and weight it would easily topple the coracle. This thought makes him change his plans but the south sea wind comes to his relief. He feels the hawser loosen his hand. The wind forces the Hispaniola to move in the opposite direction. So, Jim picks up the knife and cuts the hawser loose leaving just two strands of fiber uncut. He waits for another strong wind to finish the task. Jim hears loud voices from the cabin and recognizes Israel Hands voice. Jim hears the crew arguing violently inside. When the long awaited breeze comes, Jim cuts loose the last fibers of the hawser. The Hispaniola begins to spin and this terrifies Jim. When the coracle moves with the motion of the ship, Jim impulsively, holds a chord hanging from the ship. He decides to climb up the chord to get a look at what is going on within the cabin of the ship. One glance tells Jim that men are all drunk. He climbs down to his boat. The coracle changes its course and moves toward the sea. The ship too makes its way southward. The men on board, Jim knows, dont realize that the ship has been freed from it's anchor. Suddenly the ship turns by twenty degrees. Violent shouts follow this and the crew and now Jim sees that the men are aware of the disaster. Unable to face the fact that his life might end on high sea, he lies down in the coracle and prays. Soon he goes to sleep dreaming of his home and the Admiral Benbow.", "analysis": ""}
