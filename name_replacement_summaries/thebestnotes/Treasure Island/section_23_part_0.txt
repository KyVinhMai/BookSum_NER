He is a quarter of a mile away from the shore and thinks about paddling in. He changes his mind when he sees huge waves, carrying large shiny sea lions. In the meantime, Jim decides to approach land with the help of the current that moves northward. The sea behaves in its natural way, but Jim couldnt control the coracle as Jim was new to all this. Unable to do anything against the huge waves Jim lies down in the coracle just watching them. The waves look like mountains, hills and valleys. Every now and then Jim musters up his courage and strokes the coracle when his hopes look up and he sees the trees swaying not far away from him, he knows he was approaching land. He expects to reach the shore with the next stroke when a current pulls Jim back to the open sea. Here Jim witnesses the most unexpected scene. Half a mile away he sees the Hispaniola sailing. For a moment, he thinks about getting on board as he is dying of thirst. The ship is still uncontrolled by the men on board. Jim feels an urge to take control of the vessel and return it to the Captain. Jim rows his coracle towards the ship. A wind pulls the coracle closer. He decides to desert the coracle and grasps the jib-boom of the ship. The wave that helps Jim to get hold of the jib-boom makes the ship swagger and it hits the coracle. Jim is left hanging on the Hispaniola.", "analysis": ""}
