Hiding behind bushes, Jim sees seven or eight men running towards the Inn. Jim spots the blind beggar who orders the men to break down the door to get inside. When the marauders find Bill dead and the sea chest already opened and cleared of its treasure, the beggar concludes that Jim is responsible and must be nearby. He tells his men to find Jim and his mother and to destroy the Inn. A whistling sound is heard, like the one Jim and his mother had heard earlier, upon hearing it, the men stop their activity and quickly prepare to leave. Pew, the blind beggar, tries to entice them to stay with the treasure that is awaiting them. This doesnt work and much to the relief of Jim they start quarreling amongst themselves. The men hear the sound of four or five horse riders approaching, then coming into sight in full gallop. The men abandon Pew and run away. Even with his handicap, the blind man also tries his best to save himself, but he was trampled by the horses and drops dead.
