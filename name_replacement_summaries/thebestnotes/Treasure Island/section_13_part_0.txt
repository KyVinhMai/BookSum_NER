The strange land interests him. He is alone and makes a study of the surroundings curiously. Everything is new so him. The contorted trees, hills with craggy peaks, unknown flowing plants, deadly snakes, strange sounds of birds, everything. Amongst this the only familiar sight is that of the \"Spy-glass\". Some time passes by and Jim is able to listen to human voices too. Jim is afraid when he hears the voice of Long John Silver. He trudges towards them to overhear their conversation. He listens to Silver talking to Tom. Their heated conversation is interrupted with a sudden scream at a distance. This is accompanied by the rustle of birds. Some one had been killed. On asking what the scream was all about, Silver calmly replies: \"That?, Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan\". Tom is stunned to hear this and accuses Silver of killing him. He says that he will no longer be a member of his crew. He turns back and walks away. Silver wastes no time. He aims his crutch at Toms back and hurls it at him. With a thud it strikes him and he falls. Silver quickly pounced on him and stabbed him twice in the back to kill him. Jim is dumbfounded. He had never seen a man die before. Two men from the Hispaniola were dead. He fears that he could be next. Jim panics and runs for his life. He doesnt know where to. All he knows is he that he doesnt want to die at the hands of mutineers. But what he doesnt know is that another surprise awaits him and this brings his run to a halt.", "analysis": ""}
