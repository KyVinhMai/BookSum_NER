He tells Jim that his friends are in control of the stockade. Ben Gunn doesnt join Jim, instead he asks Jim to first talk to them about his demand he mentioned earlier and come back to him where Jim found him first. Their conversation comes to a halt when a cannonball lands ten yards away from them. Jim moves carefully towards the stockade. From the thicket Jim could see the Hispaniola. The black flag of the pirates-the Jolly Roger now fluttering on the mast. Jim lies there for some time observing the destruction the pirates had done to the island. He hears the pirates yelling loudly in a highly spirited mood. Jim makes it to the stockade. He is welcomed warmly by the crew. Jim tells them what has happened since he has been on the island. Captain Smollet issues orders for everyone to proceed with their activities. Everybody is given a task. Two are sent to fetch firewood. Two more to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor serves as the cook and Jim is appointed as a sentry. The doctor, while cooking, often comes to the door for a breath of fresh air. He inquires about Ben Gunn during these relaxing moments. After learning Ben Gunns craving for cheese, he keeps aside his Parmesan cheese, which he always carried in his snuff box, for Ben. They bury Redruth. The food was cooked. After supper the three leaders sit down to discuss their future plan of action. They can hear the sounds of the pirates who are just half a mile away. Jim dozes off after a long hard day. He is awakened when he hears Silver shout the flag of truce. It is another day on the island.", "analysis": ""}
