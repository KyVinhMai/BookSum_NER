They finally track him down, and when Dr. Livesey inquired about Captain Flint, the Squire tells them that he was the blood-thirstiest buccaneer that ever sailed who was feared by one and all. The Captain, he said, had amassed a great deal of wealth that they would require a whole ship to collect it. They open the oil skin packet that was found in the sea chest and find a book and sealed paper. The book listed information found in account books with latitudes and longitudes and an account of the number of ships they had plundered; information gathered over some twenty years. This does not help them much. But the sealed paper gives them valuable details about a nine-mile long island, Skeleton Island, with names of hills and the location of the bulk of the buried treasure. This suddenly brings light in the eyes of the Squire and Dr. Livesey. The Squire decides to unearth the hidden treasure and makes his way to Bristol to get the best ship and crew without wasting any time. He appoints Dr. Livesey as the ships doctor and Jim as a cabin boy and himself, the Captain. The doctor approves Mr. Trelawneys decision to accompany him on the condition that he would not tell anyone about their secret possession. He feared the men who had destroyed the Inn would be after them to get the details of the treasure and should anyone know of their plans, they would face grave problems.", "analysis": ""}
