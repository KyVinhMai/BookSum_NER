So they rest for a while. Talking in soft tones they discuss Flint and his men. Suddenly from the middle of the trees, the famous song of Billy Bones are heard. \"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\" Jim says, he had never seen the six men more terrified. The song stops. Silver tries to recognize the voice. Once again the voice breaks out. This time, instead of the song it says \"Darby McGrow\". Dick takes out his Bible and starts praying. But Silver is still not disturbed. He says that he is here to get the seven hundred thousand pounds from the Island and that he shall get it. This doesnt charge up this crew. Morgan feels that it is the spirits voice and stops Silver from crossing it. Silver reasons out that spirits voice doesnt echo and that it is human. Nudging his memory, Silver cries out that its Ben Gunn. Soon they are back in their original spirits. Without minding the presence of Ben Gunn, they proceed towards the treasure. Dick is still terrified and Silvers taunt terrifies him more. They reach the first of the tall trees and then the second and the third. Jim says the only thing that kept them going was the thought of the seven hundred thousand pounds. Finally they reach the edge of the thicket. Overjoyed, they shout `huzza. All of a sudden Silver increases his pace. Jim follows him. They stop when they see the most unexpected sight. The treasure has gone. It has already been excavated and the only thing that is left is the nameplate of Flints ship - WALRUS.", "analysis": ""}
