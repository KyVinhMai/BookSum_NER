The Captain senses a sinister trick so he cautions the men and positions them strategically within the stockade. Then he asks Silver what he is up to. Silver explains that he has been chosen to be the Captain of the mutineers after Captain Smollet deserted them. He expresses his wish to submit himself and wants to come to terms with the Captain. The Captain agrees to talk to him alone. Silver has a hard time climbing the steep incline to the entrance of the stockade, but when he reaches the stockade he salutes Captain Smollet. He expresses his wish to sit inside as the morning is cold and frosty. The Captain rejects his offer saying that he is nothing more than a pirate in front of him. He again cuts in as Silver attempts to greet everyone inside the stockade. Silver comes straight to the point. He asks the Captain about the map and demands it. In exchange, he offers him a safe sail back home after they unearth the treasure. He also suggests that they could divide the treasure equally on the condition that Silver would sail first with the Hispaniola. Silver, after reaching the land, would send the ship back for the Captain and his crew. Now it is the Captains turn to talk. He asks Silver and his men to come up to him, one by one, and surrender themselves. He promises them a fair trial when they return to England. If he doesnt do so, the Captain warns him of worse consequences. Silvers composure changes. He asks someone to help him stand up. Nobody moves. Silver manages by himself. He spits on the spring water to indicate his reaction to the Captains proposal. With a loud threatening yell, he stumbles out of the stockade and disappears into the woods.", "analysis": ""}
