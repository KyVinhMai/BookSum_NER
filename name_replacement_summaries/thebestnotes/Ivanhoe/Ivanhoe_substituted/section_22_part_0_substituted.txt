Isaac is relieved to learn Rebecca is alive and listens carefully when the Kodee offers, for an appropriate price, to use his friendship with the Knight Templar to free Rebecca. The Black Knight is pleasantly surprised at the decency with which the outlaws behave. At a banquet hall in the castle of York to which Anshveer Finis has invited his nobles, rumors are afoot that Kery Castle has been attacked and captured. Word has it that Bao-de-Daine and Bois-Guilbert, and perhaps De Bracy too, are dead. Finis is disturbed but listens to Lavon, who reassures him that his unscrupulous reign is invincible. De Bracy dramatically enters the banquet and announces that Richard is in England, Bois-Guilbert has fled with the Jewish girl, and Bao-de-Bouef is dead. Finis is frightened at the news and begins to drink heavily. In his drunken stupor, he realizes that many of his knights are deserting him. He quickly appoints De Bracy High Marshal to secure his loyalty. De Bracy, however, no longer trusts or believes in Finis. Finis, in turn, sets spies on De Bracy.", "analysis": ""}
