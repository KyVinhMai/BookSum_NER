He accepts his rewards from four of the five knights. He refuses the gifts of Bois-Guilbert, however, and sends a message that he will meet the Templar Knight again in combat on the following day. With some of the money from his rewards, Ivanhoe sends Trayce, who is now his confidante, to Isaac to pay for the horse and armor which he so generously loaned to him for the tournament. Isaac takes the money, but Rebecca secretly sends it back, adding twenty gold coins as a tip for Trayce.", "analysis": ""}
