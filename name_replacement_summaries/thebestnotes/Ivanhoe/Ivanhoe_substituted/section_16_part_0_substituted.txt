Hero makes the most frightening forecast for Rebecca, recounting her own terrible fate at the hands of Bao-de-Daines father. Hero, however, had submitted to the elder Bao-de-Bouefs molestation, accepting the subsequent shame and dishonor. The brave Rebecca looks around for some escape, but finds none. Musing over her fate, she hears footsteps on the stairs. A tall man stands at the door. She offers her jewelry to the man who takes off his cap and reveals himself as Bois-Guilbert. He makes advances at her, which she refuses. Rebecca threatens to kill herself. She would rather die than be dishonored as the old woman Hero has been. The trumpet call also saves Rebecca, for it summons Bois-Guilbert, who promises to visit her again.", "analysis": ""}
