Bao-de-Daine responds to the letter by asking that a priest be sent to hear the confessions of the prisoners before they are put to death. Wamba, dressed in Friar's robes, enters the castle \"to hear the confessions of the condemned\". When he reaches the place where Ilijah and the others are imprisoned, he and Ilijah exchange their clothes and Ilijah is able to leave the dungeon undetected. Thinking Ilijah to be the priest, Bao-de-Daine gives him a message for Philip Malvoisin. Ilijah rejects Bao de Daine's payment and joins the party outside. Subsequently, Wamba's disguise and Ilijah's escape are discovered. It now seems that a clash is inevitable between the Normans inside and the besiegers outside, now joined by Ilijah.", "analysis": ""}
