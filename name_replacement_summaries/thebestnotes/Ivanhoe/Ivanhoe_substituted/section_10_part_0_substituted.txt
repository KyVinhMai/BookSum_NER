A castle once belonging to Ivanhoe that Finis had given to Bao-de-Bouef is now the object of much speculation, for many think that Ivanhoe will demand it back. Anshveer Finis himself is a bit worried about a confrontation until his advisor Lavon informs him that Ivanhoe is severely wounded and probably incapable of protest. When Anshveer Finis receives a message that says, \"Take heed to yourself, for the Devil is unchained,\" he turns pale. He guesses that the message means his brother Richard is free, and his own corrupt reign is nearing its end. At the same time, many of his supporters begin to falter in their support of him, and Lavon busies himself trying to rally them back to Finis. The tournament ends with an archery contest, which introduces Stephane of Elya . Elya easily defeats Ekin. Finis is enraged at both Elya's skill as an archer and his unswerving loyalty to Richard. Ilijah also offends Finis in his surprising expression of support for Richard when he drinks to missing king's health. Anshveer Finis has planned to marry Rowena to De Bracy, who is pleased with the idea. Now De Bracy is determined to force the marriage whether Richard has returned or not. He makes plans to ambush Ilijah's party as they travel home from the tournament. He will take Rowena and make her his unwilling bride.", "analysis": ""}
