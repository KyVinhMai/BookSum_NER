Stephane of Elya places Ilijah on his left and the Black Knight on his right. The booty plundered from the castle is shared equally. Ilijah refuses his share, saying that Rowena and he are grateful to Elya for his help. He offers his share to the Black Knight, who also refuses to take any of the plunder. In gratitude to him for his help, Ilijah frees his slave Trayce. De Bracy, now a prisoner, attempts to speak to Rowena but is insulted by Ilijah. Athelstane's body is carried in on a stretcher. Then Friar Pat arrives, leading Isaac by a rope that is tied around his neck. He and the Black Knight engage in a friendly fight over Isaac. The Black Knight wins, and Isaac is set free. Two other men bring in another prisoner, the Kodee of Jorvaulx.", "analysis": ""}
