Later he learns that Ivanhoe is being taken care of by Rebecca and is relieved. Discovering that his swineherd Trayce has been helping Ivanhoe, Ilijah has him bound with rope as a punishment. Ilijah and Athelstane take their group to Anshveer Finis's palace where they have been invited to a banquet. On the way to Anshveer Finis's, the group encounters the dog, Fangs, howling. Ilijah throws his javelin at it, wounding the dog. Saxons are a superstitious lot, and Ilijah believed this howling was a sure sign of an impending danger. Trayce is upset to see the dog wounded and manages to escape his bonds. At Anshveer Finis's, Rowena refuses to attend the banquet, which annoys Ilijah. He and Athelstane discuss matters of land. Then Ilijah broaches the subject of Athelstane's marriage to Rowena.", "analysis": ""}
