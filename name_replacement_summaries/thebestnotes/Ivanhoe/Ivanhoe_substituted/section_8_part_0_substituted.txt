The thieves question him about where he got the money. When Trayce tells about Rebeccas kindness, the thieves refuse to believe that any Jew would return a payment on a loan. Trayce fights with his attackers. When he shows his courage in the conflict, the robbers surprisingly give him back his money and escort him to Ashby.", "analysis": ""}
