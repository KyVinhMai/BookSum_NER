On their way to Athelstane's castle of Coningsburgh to bury him, the Black Knight and Wamba are ambushed by Lavon and his men. Richard sounds his horn to summon Elya and his outlaws. With their help, he overcomes and kills his attackers. Only Lavon is left alive. The king banishes him forever from England and confiscates his lands. The Black Knight then reveals himself as the rightful King of England. He and Ivanhoe proceed to Coningsburgh. Athelstane, who has only been knocked unconscious and not killed, now rises to tell his story. Ivanhoe rides on, prepared and ready to champion Rebecca's fate.", "analysis": ""}
