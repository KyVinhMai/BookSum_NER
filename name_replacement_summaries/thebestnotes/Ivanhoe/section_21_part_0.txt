Robin of Locksley places Cedric on his left and the Black Knight on his right. The booty plundered from the castle is shared equally. Cedric refuses his share, saying that Rowena and he are grateful to Locksley for his help. He offers his share to the Black Knight, who also refuses to take any of the plunder. In gratitude to him for his help, Cedric frees his slave Gurth. De Bracy, now a prisoner, attempts to speak to Rowena but is insulted by Cedric. Athelstane's body is carried in on a stretcher. Then Friar Tuck arrives, leading Isaac by a rope that is tied around his neck. He and the Black Knight engage in a friendly fight over Isaac. The Black Knight wins, and Isaac is set free. Two other men bring in another prisoner, the Prior of Jorvaulx.", "analysis": ""}
