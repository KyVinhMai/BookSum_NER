Front-de-Boeuf is seriously wounded in the battle. As he lies dying, the old hag Urfried accuses him of all kinds of sins, the worst being the murder of his own father. Hungry for revenge for wrongs done to her by his family, she sets fire to the castle. Both she and Front-de-Boeuf die in the flames. The Black Knight saves Ivanhoe and captures De Bracy. Everyone manages to escape to freedom except Rebecca, who is carried away by Bois-Guilbert, the Knight Templar who wants to defile her. In attempting to stop Bois-Guilbert, Athelstane is hit on the head and falls down, apparently dead.", "analysis": ""}
