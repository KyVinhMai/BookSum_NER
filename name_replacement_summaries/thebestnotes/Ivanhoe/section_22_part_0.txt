Isaac is relieved to learn Rebecca is alive and listens carefully when the Prior offers, for an appropriate price, to use his friendship with the Knight Templar to free Rebecca. The Black Knight is pleasantly surprised at the decency with which the outlaws behave. At a banquet hall in the castle of York to which Prince John has invited his nobles, rumors are afoot that Torquilstone Castle has been attacked and captured. Word has it that Front-de-Boeuf and Bois-Guilbert, and perhaps De Bracy too, are dead. John is disturbed but listens to Fitzurse, who reassures him that his unscrupulous reign is invincible. De Bracy dramatically enters the banquet and announces that Richard is in England, Bois-Guilbert has fled with the Jewish girl, and Front-de-Bouef is dead. John is frightened at the news and begins to drink heavily. In his drunken stupor, he realizes that many of his knights are deserting him. He quickly appoints De Bracy High Marshal to secure his loyalty. De Bracy, however, no longer trusts or believes in John. John, in turn, sets spies on De Bracy.", "analysis": ""}
