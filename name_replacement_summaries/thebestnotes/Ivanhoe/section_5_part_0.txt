A message is sent to him by Lady Rowena, demanding his presence. She wants more news of Ivanhoe since she heard the Palmer mention Ivanhoes courageous exploits. All that the Palmer tells her is that Ivanhoe, having fought bravely, is on his way home. Before going to bed, the Palmer warns Isaac that he has overheard Bois-Guilbert ordering his Moslem slaves to follow Isaac and rob him. Isaac is grateful to the Palmer, and before he escapes, rewards the Palmer with a favor. He sends a letter to his Jewish kinsman asking him to give the Palmer a horse and armor so that he can participate in the Ashby tournament.", "analysis": ""}
