Earlier in the novel, King Richard proved his valor at Ashby disguised as the Black Knight. After the victory, he quickly disappeared before his identity was questioned. In this scene, he is traveling in the forest when he meets the Clerk of Copmanhurst, who is actually Friar Tuck. The two trust one another; they eat and drink in great companionship. The king and the fat priest get on so well that after supper they decide to sing together. Each chooses a song that makes fun of the other; the priest pokes fun at Crusaders and Richard mocks the priest.", "analysis": ""}
