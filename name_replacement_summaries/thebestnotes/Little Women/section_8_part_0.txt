The experience is not quite as much fun as she anticipated as the other girls exchange superior glances over Megs out-of-style, well-worn tarleton gown. A delivery of flowers from Laurie and a note from her mother enable her to shake off her embarrassment and almost enjoy an evening of dancing until she hears people talking about her on the other side of a thin divider wall. They speak of her \"dowdy tarleton,\" the \"fib about her mamma\" , and the \"plans\" of Mrs. M. Meg allows the girls to loan her a very low cut blue gown for the next party. They adorn her with jewels, flowers, and makeup, making her look like something out of a fashion magazine more than herself. Although Meg doesnt feel quite right, she tries to act the part of a fashionable lady, flirting with her fan and laughing at feeble jokes told by young men. Her discomfort is complete when Laurie appears at the dance and is obviously displeased at her appearance. She is hurt and angry at Laurie until she overhears one of the guests say that \"they have spoilt her entirely, shes nothing but a doll tonight.\" Laurie promises not to tell Marmee and the girls about Megs dress, but when Meg gets home she confesses, telling her mother that she \"drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was, altogether, abominable.\" Marmee and the girls discuss the problems caused by putting too much emphasis on money and fine things rather than on love, happiness and self respect.", "analysis": ""}
