He finds himself drawn to Amy, but she is disgusted with him. She is too lady-like and he too lazy for them to actually quarrel, but she accuses him of indolence and of neglecting his own talent and potential. When she discovers that the reason for his indifference is Jo's rejection, Amy is sympathetic but still cannot accept the changes in him. Laurie tries to affect an indifference to her scolding, but her words have a profound effect on him.", "analysis": ""}
