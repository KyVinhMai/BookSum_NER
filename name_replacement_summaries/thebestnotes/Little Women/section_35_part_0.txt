He seems glad to see her and admires the changes in her, but the sentiment is not shared. To her, he seems indifferent, and his dandy-type compliments are hollow and insincere. They attend a Christmas ball where his off-hand remarks and relief at getting out of a dance offend her. Amy deliberately ignores Laurie and dances with several others, spending most of the evening with an 18 year old Polish count. Laurie observes her in spite of himself, and when the count leaves, he spends the remainder of the ball with her. The narrator drops a not-so-subtle hint that the evening is the beginning of a relationship between the two.", "analysis": ""}
