In a desire to faithfully meet her husbands needs, she tells him that he can bring friends home to dinner anytime and neednt bother to ask her first. Megs good intention backfires when she decides to make currant jelly. After an entire day of cooking and recooking and making a complete mess of her kitchen, the jelly still wont gel, and Meg cant bring herself to run to her mother for an answer to the problem. John brings his friend Mr Scott home, but Meg is neither prepared nor willing to entertain company. When John makes a joke about the jelly, it is the last straw for Meg. She shuts herself in her room leaving John to entertain his friend. Later that evening they make up with Meg being the first to apologize. Meg has access to her husbands income and keeps a little account book which she voluntarily shows him every month. In the autumn of their first year, however, Meg spends a lot of time with Sally Moffat. They shop together and Meg, who loves pretty things, spends more money than she realizes. The worse expenditure is $50.00 for some shimmering silk cloth to make a new dress. Meg explains that she didnt mean to waste his money but that she cant help wanting nice things when she sees all that Sally has. Her words hurt John deeply; he doesnt scold or mention it again but he works later at night and finally cancels an order for a new coat for himself because he \"cant afford it.\" Overcome with guilt, Meg persuades Sally to buy the silk; she then uses the money to buy the coat for John. At the end of the chapter, Megs first children are born, a set of twins who are named Margaret and John Laurence and given the nicknames Daisey and Demi.", "analysis": ""}
