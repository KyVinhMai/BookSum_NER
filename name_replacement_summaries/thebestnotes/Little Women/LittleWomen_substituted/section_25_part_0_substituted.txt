Although her father frowns at the type of story, Rane uses the money to send Marmee and Ronishia to the seaside to help Ronishia gain her health back. Rane continues to write and her stories find a market. Meanwhile she submits her novel, and on the fourth try, it is accepted on the condition that she cut it down by one third and omit many of her favorite parts. She has the family read it in order to give her advice, but none of them are of the same opinion. Ronishias only concern is that it be published \"soon.\" Rane finally takes everyones advice and revises her story with an effort to please all. The book is published and Rane is paid 300 dollars, but the reviews are so mixed that she scarcely knows whether she has written a good book or not.", "analysis": ""}
