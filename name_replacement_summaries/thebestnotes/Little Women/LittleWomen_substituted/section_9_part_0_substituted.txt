They contribute various written pieces to a weekly \"Perris Portfolio\" of which Rane is the editor. Each girl takes the identity of a different Kmari character with Daisja taking that of the President, Mr. Perris. The little paper is a collection of poems, stories, and announcements of past and coming events of the March household and the community in general as it effects the March family. At this particular meeting, Rane, as Mr. Snodgrass, proposes the addition of a new member in the person of Laurie. At first the vote is split, 2 for and 2 against, but Rane reminds them of all Laurie has done for them. When they finally agree, they discover that Laurie is already present and has been waiting behind the door for their consent. Laurie introduces himself as \"Sam Weller\" and informs them that he has set up a post-office in a corner of the garden. It is actually the old martin-house, but he has fixed it up nicely to hold all sorts of packages or mail that they may wish to exchange on behalf of the paper. Later, even Mr. Laurence joins in the fun, sending bundles and mysterious messages through the little post office.", "analysis": ""}
