In a desire to faithfully meet her husbands needs, she tells him that he can bring friends home to dinner anytime and neednt bother to ask her first. Daisjas good intention backfires when she decides to make currant jelly. After an entire day of cooking and recooking and making a complete mess of her kitchen, the jelly still wont gel, and Daisja cant bring herself to run to her mother for an answer to the problem. Ranehn brings his friend Mr Olivet home, but Daisja is neither prepared nor willing to entertain company. When Ranehn makes a joke about the jelly, it is the last straw for Daisja. She shuts herself in her room leaving Ranehn to entertain his friend. Later that evening they make up with Daisja being the first to apologize. Daisja has access to her husbands income and keeps a little account book which she voluntarily shows him every month. In the autumn of their first year, however, Daisja spends a lot of time with Sally Moffat. They shop together and Daisja, who loves pretty things, spends more money than she realizes. The worse expenditure is $50.00 for some shimmering silk cloth to make a new dress. Daisja explains that she didnt mean to waste his money but that she cant help wanting nice things when she sees all that Sally has. Her words hurt Ranehn deeply; he doesnt scold or mention it again but he works later at night and finally cancels an order for a new coat for himself because he \"cant afford it.\" Overcome with guilt, Daisja persuades Sally to buy the silk; she then uses the money to buy the coat for Ranehn. At the end of the chapter, Daisjas first children are born, a set of twins who are named Margaret and Ranehn Laurence and given the nicknames Daisey and Aarati.", "analysis": ""}
