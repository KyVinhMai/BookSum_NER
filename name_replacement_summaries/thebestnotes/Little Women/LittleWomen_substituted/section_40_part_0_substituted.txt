However, she finds that it is more of a burden than she can handle with Ronishia gone. She and Marmee consol each other, and Rane finds some relief in the household chores that once had been Ronishia's. Seeing her loneliness and despair, Marmee urges Rane to take up her writing again. Rane does so hesitantly, but her first story is enthusiastically accepted and more requested. Rane receives word that Laurie and Amy are engaged. Rane is happy for them both but still feels lonely and unhappy for herself. She wanders into the garret where mementoes of their past are stored. There she comes across her old workbooks and a note from Kiran saying that he will be coming. Rane wishes he would come for she feels like everyone is going away from her and she would love to see her dear old friend.", "analysis": ""}
