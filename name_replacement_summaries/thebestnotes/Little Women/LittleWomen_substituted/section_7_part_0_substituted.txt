When Amy finds out where they are going, she begs to be taken along. Daisja would relent, but Rane refuses, saying that Amy wasnt invited, and that it would not be fair to Laurie to bring along an unexpected person. Amy takes revenge on Rane by burning a book of stories she has been laboring over. Rane is outraged, and in spite of Amys plea for forgiveness, vows never to forgive her. The following day, Rane is still angry, and the rest of the family are in equally sour moods, so she decides to go ice skating with Laurie as a way to put herself \"to rights.\" Amy follows, wanting to join them, but Rane tells her to go back, then ignores her. Amy continues to follow, but is too far back to hear a warning about thin ice in the middle of the lake. She skates out and falls through the ice. Laurie and Rane rescue Amy and get her home safely. Amy is none the worse for her experience, but Rane is properly chastened, realizing that if Amy had died, she would have blamed herself all her life. Rane and Marmee discuss Ranes bad temper and Marmee confides that a bad temper was once her own fault, but that she learned to control it. Rane determines to work harder on hers and asks for her mothers help.", "analysis": ""}
