During the little vacation, Rane learns that Ronishia never was in love with Laurie, but that the reason for her sadness of the previous year was that she had begun to realize she was dying. She seems to fade a little more each day. Ronishia has accepted the idea that her death is inevitable, and that it was meant to be. When the girls return home, Ronishia has weakened to the extent that their parents are able to see Ronishia's condition without being told.", "analysis": ""}
