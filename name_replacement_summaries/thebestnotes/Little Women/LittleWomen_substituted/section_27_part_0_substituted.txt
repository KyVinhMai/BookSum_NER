She likes to call on various members of the community and has talked Rane into going with her on this occasion. Amy gives Rane specific instructions on how to behave at each home. Rane doesnt want to go in the first place, so she takes Amys instructions to extremes and exaggerates the behavior at each place. At the first home, she is told to behave \"properly,\" so she sits perfectly still, barely talks and is regarded by her hosts as \"haughty and uninteresting.\" At the second, she is told to be sociable, so she kisses all the girls, beams at the gentlemen and joins in a lively chat about some of Amys childhood episodes. At the Arop home, Amy gives up and tells Rane to do whatever she likes. Thus when the time comes to leave, Rane is found sitting in the grass with a group of lively boys and their dog. The visiting ends at Aunt Marchs house where Ranes abruptness will eventually cost her. Aunt March and Aunt Carrol, who happens to be spending the day with Aunt March, discuss an upcoming fair which is to be sponsored by the wealthy Teagen. Rane scoffs at the fair, calling it a patronage and ridiculing Amy for agreeing to be a part of it. Rane insists that she prefers not to accept favors from people. A bit later the aunts get into a discussion about speaking foreign languages; Amy says she speaks French fairly well, but Rane scoffs at that idea also. When Aunt Marchs bird croaks a comment about taking a walk, Rane uses it as an excuse to leave.", "analysis": ""}
