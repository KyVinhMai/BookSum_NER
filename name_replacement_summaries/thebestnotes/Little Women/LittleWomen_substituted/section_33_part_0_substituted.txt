He proposes to her in spite of her objections and she tells him that although she is very fond of him, she does not love him in the way that he wants her to. Mr. Laurence is sympathetic with his grandson, but understands that love cannot be forced. In an attempt to consol Laurie and get his mind off of his feelings of rejection, Mr. Laurence plans a trip to London. At first Laurie objects, but promises of utter freedom to wander Europe while Mr. Laurence tends to business in London finally convince him to go. He has no interest in the trip however, and even his final words to Rane are a plea for her to reconsider.", "analysis": ""}
