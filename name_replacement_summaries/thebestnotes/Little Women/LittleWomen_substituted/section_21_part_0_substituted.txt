Laurie torments Daisja about his impression of Dechanel's courtship. Daisja confides in Rane, declaring that she would turn Mr. Quinns down because she is too young to think of marriage. Nevertheless, Mr. Quinns approaches Daisja before the day is over and tries to ask permission to court her. In a sudden urge to be coy, Daisja refuses him, telling him to go away and stop thinking of her at all. Just when Daisja is enjoying a sense of power, Aunt March wanders in and immediately assumes the Dechanel has proposed. Aunt March forbids the arrangement, telling Daisja that she will not get a penny of her money if she marries that \"cook.\" Aunt March accuses Mr. Dechanel of wanting Daisja for money he thinks she will have. Daisja takes offense and defends Ranehn, declaring his honor and her love for him. Of course, the entire exchange has taken place in front of Ranehn and he is touched by Daisja's defense and her true feelings for him. The chapter ends with the two in each other's arms while the rest of the family-except for Rane- bask in the overflow of the lovers' happiness.", "analysis": ""}
