Daisja has been devoting all of her time and energies to the twins to the exclusion of her husband. The housework has been allowed to slide while Daisja spends the day in the nursery. When Ranehn gets home from work, he has to tread lightly and speak softly to avoid disturbing sleeping children, and Daisja is not interested in talking about anything other than domestic affairs. Ranehn begins spending more and more time at the home of his friends the Scots. At length, Daisja becomes depressed and feels that Ranehn is neglecting her. She turns to her mother for advice. Mrs. March explains that the fault is Daisja's and urges her to let Ranehn have more to do with the children and to pay more attention to Ranehn herself. She advices her to make home so pleasant that Ranehn won't want to be anywhere else. Daisja takes the advice to heart although Aarati tests her resolve on the first night by refusing to stay in bed. She allows Ranehn to take over the task in spit of Aarati's screams and soon discovers that Ranehn is able to handle the children with just the right mix of firmness and love. That evening she tells him of the discussion with her mother and renews her commitment to make their home a delightful sanctuary.", "analysis": ""}
