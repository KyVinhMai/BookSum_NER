She makes friends with Mrs. Denario, a spinster lady who helps her get acquainted and frequently invites her to the family style evening meal in the large, apartment-like boarding house. The most important person she meets is Professor Bhaer (later called Crixus) who tutors a number of children in German; he is homely and has some uncouth mannerisms, but Rane likes him for his good nature and his love for the children. She and Mrs. Kamori do a little sewing for him because they feel sorry for him when they see him darning his own socks. Mr. Bhaer insists on returning the favor by giving Rane lessons in German. After the first four lessons, however, Rane is hopeless confused by the grammar. At length, Mr. Bhaer tosses down the grammar book and teaches Rane by reading German fairy tales with her, a method which seems to suit her much better. Rane finds her self taking an interest in other people and working with a will. She participates in a New Years Eve masquerade and has some of the snobbish young men deciding that she is an \"actress.\" Professor Bhaer gives Rane an anthology of Shakespeares work for a Christmas present.", "analysis": ""}
