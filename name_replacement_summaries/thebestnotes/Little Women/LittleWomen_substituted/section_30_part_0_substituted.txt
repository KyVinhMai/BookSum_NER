She asks Rane to keep an eye on her and to find out what's wrong. Rane thinks the problem is just that Ronishia is growing up. A few days of observation and some coincidental remarks about Laurie convince Rane that Ronishia is in love with Laurie, but that she is hiding her feelings because she believes Rane wants Laurie. Laurie himself is in love with Rane and tries to court her at every opportunity. Rane finally decides to take a trip to New York where Mrs. Kamori, an old friend of Marmee's, has been looking for someone to work as a governess for her children. Hopefully, this will give Ronishia an opportunity to draw Laurie's attentions toward herself.", "analysis": ""}
