Laurie torments Meg about his impression of Brooke's courtship. Meg confides in Jo, declaring that she would turn Mr. Brooks down because she is too young to think of marriage. Nevertheless, Mr. Brooks approaches Meg before the day is over and tries to ask permission to court her. In a sudden urge to be coy, Meg refuses him, telling him to go away and stop thinking of her at all. Just when Meg is enjoying a sense of power, Aunt March wanders in and immediately assumes the Brooke has proposed. Aunt March forbids the arrangement, telling Meg that she will not get a penny of her money if she marries that \"cook.\" Aunt March accuses Mr. Brooke of wanting Meg for money he thinks she will have. Meg takes offense and defends John, declaring his honor and her love for him. Of course, the entire exchange has taken place in front of John and he is touched by Meg's defense and her true feelings for him. The chapter ends with the two in each other's arms while the rest of the family-except for Jo- bask in the overflow of the lovers' happiness.", "analysis": ""}
