She asks Jo to keep an eye on her and to find out what's wrong. Jo thinks the problem is just that Beth is growing up. A few days of observation and some coincidental remarks about Laurie convince Jo that Beth is in love with Laurie, but that she is hiding her feelings because she believes Jo wants Laurie. Laurie himself is in love with Jo and tries to court her at every opportunity. Jo finally decides to take a trip to New York where Mrs. Kirke, an old friend of Marmee's, has been looking for someone to work as a governess for her children. Hopefully, this will give Beth an opportunity to draw Laurie's attentions toward herself.", "analysis": ""}
