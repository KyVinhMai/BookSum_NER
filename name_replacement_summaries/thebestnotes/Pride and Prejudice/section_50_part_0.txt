Jane is initially shocked because she was under the impression that Elizabeth still disliked Darcy. Elizabeth assures her sister that her feelings have changed, her prejudices have vanished, and she is very much in love with him. Jane is genuinely happy for her sister. The next evening Darcy asks Mr. Bennet's consent to marry Elizabeth. Mr. Bennet grants him the permission grudgingly, for he believes Darcy to be an insolent, proud man. To improve her father's opinion, Elizabeth reveals Darcy's kind intervention in getting Lydia married. On hearing the news of Darcy's basic goodness, Mr. Bennet becomes happy for his favorite child. Mrs. Bennet, on hearing the news, is overjoyed. She quickly forgets that she has hated Darcy in the past; she now shows an admirable awe for her future son-in-law. Mr. Bennet says that he likes all his three sons-in-law; ironically, he says he probably likes Wickham the most.", "analysis": ""}
