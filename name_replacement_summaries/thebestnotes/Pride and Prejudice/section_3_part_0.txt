Both of them agree that Bingley is not only rich and handsome, but also very refined. They also agree that Darcy is uncouth and unpleasant. Elizabeth has not taken to Mr. Bingleys sisters and finds them proud and conceited, thinking highly of themselves and very poorly of the people who are not as wealthy as they. The good-hearted Jane, however, refuses to see faults in others and considers them charming. There exists a firm friendship between Darcy and Bingley although they are temperamentally opposite. Bingleys easygoing, friendly nature endears him to Darcy, and Bingley places a great premium on Darcys judgement and sharp intellect. Darcy is the unstated superior amongst the two but his pride is monstrous. The manner in which the two friends react to the party is quite typical of them. While Bingley is absolutely floored by the bevy of beauties, especially Jane Bennet, Darcys response is negative: he finds the guests a queer assortment of people who lack beauty and fashion.", "analysis": ""}
