Jane wisely says that there are two sides to every story. A ball is announced at Netherfield, and Mr. Bingley and his sisters call on the Bennets to issue an invitation. Mr. Collins asks Elizabeth for the first two dances. Elizabeth accepts grudgingly, for she had hoped to dance with Wickham. For the next few days, the girls are confined indoors because of the rains, but they eagerly await the Netherfield ball.", "analysis": ""}
