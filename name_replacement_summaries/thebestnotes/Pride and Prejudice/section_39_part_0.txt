Lydia has eloped with Wickham, which distresses Elizabeth greatly since she knows that Wickham has not married her sister. Jane asks Elizabeth to return home immediately and asks Mr. Gardiner to aid their father with a search for Lydia in London. When Darcy enters, Elizabeth is trembling and in tears. He is genuinely concerned when he hears of the calamity. He holds himself partially responsible for what has happened to Lydia since he has failed to speak out against Wickham. Elizabeth also condemns herself for not warning her family about Wickham. She decides she must return home immediately to give support to the family.", "analysis": ""}
