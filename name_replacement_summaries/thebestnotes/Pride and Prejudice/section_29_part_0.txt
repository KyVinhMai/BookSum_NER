Darcy suddenly walks in. Both of them are at loss for words, but Elizabeth finally asks about the abrupt departure of the Bingleys from Netherfield. Darcy does not say much, but he tells her that Bingley may dispose of Netherfield. Their conversation is interrupted by the entry of Charlotte and her sister. After Darcy departs, Charlotte tells Elizabeth of her notion that Darcy is in love with her. Elizabeth laughs at the suggestion. Darcy and Fitzwilliam begin to often come to the parsonage. Although Darcy usually says little, Charlotte notices that he often looks at Elizabeth.", "analysis": ""}
