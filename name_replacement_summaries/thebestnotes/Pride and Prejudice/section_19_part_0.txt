Elizabeth assumes she is simply being kind to Mr. Collins and the Bennets; in truth, Charlotte, who greatly fears being a spinster, is interested in Mr. Collins as a husband for herself. She does not care if her husband is foolish and vain, as long as she has a husband; she has no romantic ideas that marriage must be based on love. She tells Elizabeth, \"I am not romantic you know. . . I only ask for a comfortable home.\" Charlottes attention to Mr. Collins pays off for her. In his characteristic garrulous way, he proposes to her and tells her to set the day of the wedding. Sir William Lucas and his wife are delighted with the match, but Elizabeth is horrified when she learns that her friend has consented to marry the detestable man.", "analysis": ""}
