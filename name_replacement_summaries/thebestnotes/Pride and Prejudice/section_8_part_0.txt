Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by Lydia and Catherine, arrives soon after breakfast. She is not alarmed by Janes condition, but both she and the apothecary decide that Jane has not yet sufficiently recovered to return home. During the visit, Elizabeth is embarrassed by her mothers inane talk and the foolish behavior of her sisters. Lydia continuously presses Mr. Bingley to give a ball at Netherfield Park. After Mrs. Bennet and her two daughters depart, Elizabeth goes to attend to Jane. The Bingley sisters chat disparagingly about the inappropriate behavior of Mrs. Bennet and her daughters.", "analysis": ""}
