They meet Charlotte and Mr. Collins at the parsonage, which adjoins Lady Catherines estate, Rosings Park. Elizabeth is warmly welcomed by her girlfriend, who has not changed. She is content with marriage and has learned to gracefully bear her peculiar husband. Mr. Collins is as vainglorious and cumbersome as ever. The next morning, Maria Lucas enthusiastically points out to Elizabeth two ladies who have arrived at the garden gate. One of them is Miss de Bourgh, a thin, pale, cross-looking maiden; Elizabeth thinks that she would make an ideal wife for proud Darcy. After the guests depart, Mr. Collins says that everyone has been invited to dine at Rosings the next day.", "analysis": ""}
