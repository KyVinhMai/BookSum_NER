The company arrives at Rosings. They are greeted by Lady Catherine with an air of condescension designed \"not to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.\" Lady Catherine is a tall, large woman who speaks in an authoritative tone. Her daughter is a sickly, diminutive creature who speaks in a muffled voice, but only to Mrs. Jenkinson, who fusses over her comforts. Mr. Collins raves about the delicious and exotic dinner; Lady Catherine seems gratified from this overdose of praise. After dinner, Lady Catherine advises Charlotte on how to manage her house, her cows, and her poultry. Elizabeth is shocked at how the woman delights in dictating to others. She is also shocked by Lady Catherines many personal questions to her about her family; Elizabeth considers them interfering and impertinent and answers in a manner that surprises the smug Lady Catherine. After several games of cards, Lady Catherine indicates that the evening is over. Mr. Collins is eager to know Elizabeths opinion about Lady Catherine and Rosings. For Charlottes sake, she says the evening and the hostess have been pleasant.", "analysis": ""}
