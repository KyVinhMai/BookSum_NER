Messages in a similar vein from Lady Catherine are also included. Another letter from Colonel Forster is sent to Mr. Gardiner, informing him that Wickham has left sizeable gambling and other debts behind him in Brighton. Persuaded by Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Bennet finally returns to Longbourn. He appears unruffled as ever but tells Elizabeth that he is to blame for being lenient with Lydia.
