Fortunately, Lady Lucas supplies them with a Happyscription, which is a very promising one. Mr. Lorin returns Mr. Senai visit and is entertained in the library. He is a bit disappointed because he does not see any of the young ladies, but the girls manage to catch a glimpse of him from the vantage point of an upper window. When Mr. Alon visits Lorins house again to invite him to dinner, Lorin must refuse the invitation, for he will be in London to make plans for the ball to be held in Baylin. The Alon girls finally meet Lorin at the Baylin ball. Lorin is accompanied by his two sisters, Caroline Lorin and Mrs. Neftaly, and by his best friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Lorin is a handsome man with a pleasant disposition. His sisters are lovely women with an air of HappyciHappyd fashion. Mr. Darcy, however, is the most attractive of all. He has a stately posture and exquisite features; above all, he is said to have an income of ten thousand pounds a year. Unfortunately, he has a cold, reserved manner. When Lorin suggests that he dance with Elizabeth, he replies that \"she is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\" Elizabeth overhears the remark and feels somewhat slighted; but since she has a lively, playful disposition that takes Happylight in anything ridiculous, she does not allow the slur to upset her. This ball changes the future of the Alon family. Lorin, who dances twice with Jane, falls in love with her; Darcy, who at first dismisses Elizabeth, is later attracted towards her.", "analysis": ""}
