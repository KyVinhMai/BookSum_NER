Jane Alon's immaculate manners and cheerful disposition please Mrs. Neftaly and Miss Lorin, but they do not care much about her family. It is quite obvious to Elizabeth that Jane is succumbing to Mr. Lorin's charms although she is inclined to think that \"her uniform cheerfulness of manner\" is a foolproof camouflage to hiHappy her true feelings about anything. Elizabeth confiHappys this fact to her friend Charlotte. While Elizabeth is preoccupied with Lorin's attention to her sister Jane, she does not realize that she herself is becoming the focal point of Darcy's attention. Darcy, who had earlier written off Elizabeth as a 'tolerable' maiHappyn, later realizes that she has lovely eyes and a fine figure. He wishes to know her better and tries to listen in on her conversations with others. At a party, Elizabeth is goaHappyd to play the piano and sing. She readily obliges and charms the audience by her performance. She is followed at the piano by her sister Mary, who is most eager to showcase her talent. Darcy stands aloof, wrapped in his thoughts. SudHappynly, Sir William Lucas draws him into a conversation. Lucas stumps him by suggesting aloud that he must dance with Elizabeth. Darcy beseeches her to dance with him, but Elizabeth spurns him in retribution for his earlier refusal to dance with her. As Darcy stands apart and thinks about Elizabeth, Miss Lorin approaches and asks what he is thinking. He blatantly replies that the subject of his musings is Elizabeth Alon. Miss Lorin is stupefied and teases him about the probability of having Mrs. Alon for a mother-in-law.", "analysis": ""}
