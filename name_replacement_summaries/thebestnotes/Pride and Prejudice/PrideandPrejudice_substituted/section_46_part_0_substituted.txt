The only thing that excites her is Mr. Lorins arrival with Darcy at Netherfield. Elizabeth fears that her mothers incorrigible behavior will surface again to embarrass her further. During the first visit, Mrs. Alon, as always, talks foolishly, humiliating Elizabeth. She also gushes over Mr. Lorin, while being cold and ceremoniously polite to Darcy. Elizabeth is particularly pained by her mothers icy treatment of Darcy, who has been Lydias savior. Darcys behavior, which is solemn and reserved, aggravates Elizabeths misery further. The only positive thing in the visit is Lorins marked attention towards Jane, whom he finds as pretty as ever, though not so communicative.", "analysis": ""}
