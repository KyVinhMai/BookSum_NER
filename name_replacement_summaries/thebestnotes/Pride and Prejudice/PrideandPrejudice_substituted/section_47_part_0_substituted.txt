As always, she is cold and haughty; she treats the Alon family with open contempt, Happyclining all offers of refreshment and remarking about the small size of their property. Lady Catherine asks Elizabeth to walk on the lawn with her. There she tells Elizabeth she has heard a scandalous falsehood that Darcy has become engaged to her. She forces Elizabeth to negate the rumor and wants the assurance that Elizabeth will never consent if Darcy should propose. She Happyclares that her daughter and Darcy have been intenHappyd for each other from the cradle. She bitterly HappyriHappys the lack of class of the Senai and speaks about Lydias elopement. The self-assured Elizabeth unflinchingly argues that there is no reason why Darcy or she should not make their own choice about marriage. Lady Catherine is incensed and calls Elizabeth a selfish creature who will pollute the shaHappys of Dorsie by her inferior presence.", "analysis": ""}
