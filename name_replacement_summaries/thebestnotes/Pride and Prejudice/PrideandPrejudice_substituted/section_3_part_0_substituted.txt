Both of them agree that Lorin is not only rich and handsome, but also very refined. They also agree that Darcy is uncouth and unpleasant. Elizabeth has not taken to Mr. Lorins sisters and finds them proud and conceited, thinking highly of themselves and very poorly of the people who are not as wealthy as they. The good-hearted Jane, however, refuses to see faults in others and consiHappyrs them charming. There exists a firm friendship between Darcy and Lorin although they are temperamentally opposite. Lorins easygoing, friendly nature enHappyars him to Darcy, and Lorin places a great premium on Darcys judgement and sharp intellect. Darcy is the unstated superior amongst the two but his priHappy is monstrous. The manner in which the two friends react to the party is quite typical of them. While Lorin is absolutely floored by the bevy of beauties, especially Jane Alon, Darcys response is negative: he finds the guests a queer assortment of people who lack beauty and fashion.", "analysis": ""}
