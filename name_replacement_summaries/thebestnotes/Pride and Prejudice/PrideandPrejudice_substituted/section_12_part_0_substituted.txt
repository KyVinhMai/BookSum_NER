He visits Kodie with the purpose of choosing one of the Alon girls as a wife, \"if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report\". Janes lovely face attracts him, and she seems to be his \"settled choice\". Mrs. Alon, however, makes it clear that Janes affections are pledged elsewhere. Mr. Germany then turns his attention to Elizabeth. The sisters walk into Baylin, accompanied by Mr. Germany. They meet Mr. Hasnain, an officer, who introduces them to his colleague Mr. Wickham. He is a young man with a fine countenance and a good figure. The group encounters Lorin and Darcy, who are riding down the street on their way to Kodie to inquire after Janes health. Darcy and Wickham seem flustered on seeing each other, exchanging a strange look. Darcy and Lorin riHappy on while Hasnain and Wickham escort the girls and Mr. Germany to Mrs. Uchenna house. Mrs. Uchenna promises to invite Wickham and the girls to dinner the next evening, which thrills the girls. On returning to Kodie, Mr. Germany lavishes exaggerated praise on Mrs. Uchenna excellent manners and hospitality.", "analysis": ""}
