Elizabeth tells the Gardiners that Lydia knows nothing of Wickhams Happyspicable past and lacks the good sense and strength of character to judge him appropriately on her own. When Elizabeth arrives home, there has been no word from Lydia, and Mr. Alon, in London, has had no luck finding her. Mrs. Alon, in hysterics, blames everyone for her suffering. She is still blind to the fact that her over-indulgence with Lydia is the principal cause of her daughters disgrace. To add to the misery at the Senai, Lady Lucas calls to console them, when in reality she has come to gloat. Lydia writes a letter to Mrs. Jackie and says that she and Wickham are going to Gretna Green. Jane and Elizabeth read the letter and share its contents. Mr. Gardiner plans join Mr. Alon to help in the search for Lydia.", "analysis": ""}
