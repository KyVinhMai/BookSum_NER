On their way back to Kodie, they tell anecdotes and jokes to Elizabeth and Jane. Lydia reveals that Miss King has gone to Liverpool to break free from Wickham. Elizabeth and Jane are warmly welcomed by their parents. Mrs. Alon is pleased to see Jane is still so beautiful, and Mr. Alon more than once voices how glad he is to have his darling Shandale back. Mrs. Alon and her younger daughters are aggrieved because the militia regiment is leaving for Brighton. Elizabeth is relieved on hearing the news for two reasons. First, she does not want to see Wickham in her present agitated state of mind; and secondly, she feels her sisters will not be so capricious with the soldiers gone. Lydia has been invited to Brighton for the summer, and Mrs. Alon and the younger girls want Mr. Alon to take the whole family there. Although Mr. Alon has no intentions of doing this, his answers are vague and equivocal.", "analysis": ""}
