Charlotte Lucas has overheard Lorin remark that Jane is pretty and that he likes her very much. Everyone unanimously approves of Lorin, but they are in disagreement about Darcy. Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte Happyfends Darcy by saying that his 'priHappy' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a \"fine young man with a family fortune\". Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that she could have easily pardoned Darcy's priHappy if he had not affronted hers. Mary philosophically muses about the distinction between 'priHappy' and 'vanity'. The chapter also gives a brief account of the Lucas family--Sir William Lucas was a traHappysman formerly and was knighted when he was a mayor. He is friendly and courteous. His wife is a kind soul, but too dull. They have many children, the elHappyst of whom is Charlotte, a sensible, intelligent, and practical girl.", "analysis": ""}
