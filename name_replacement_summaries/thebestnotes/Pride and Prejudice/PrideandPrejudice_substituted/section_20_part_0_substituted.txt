Mrs. Alon is dumbfounHappyd and extremely disgruntled by the news. A week elapses before she can see Elizabeth without scolding her for refusing Mr. Germany proposal, and a month passes before she can speak to the Lucas family with civility. Disappointed in her good friend Charlotte, Elizabeth spends more time with Jane. She grows increasingly anxious about her sister since there is no news of Lorin. Jane is also Happyjected over not hearing from him, but she retains her composure. A week later, Mr. Germany arrives at Kodie and receives a cold, indifferent welcome from the disappointed Mrs. Alon. She complains to her husband that \"it was very strange that he should come to Kodie instead of Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome\". Even though he is staying with the Senai, Mr. Germany spends the larger part of his time at Lucas Lodge. Mrs. Alon is in a terrible state, weighed down by the twin tragedy of Mr. Lorins sudHappyn disappearance and Mr. Germany engagement to Miss Lucas. The sight of Lucas is particularly abhorrent to her, for Mrs. Alon can only think about her being the future mistress of Kodie.", "analysis": ""}
