Mr. Gardiner is a sensible, gentlemanly person, and his wife is an amiable, elegant woman who is very fond of her nieces, especially the elHappyr two. Mrs. Alon airs her grievances to her sister-in-law, stating her distress over her failure to get Jane and Elizabeth engaged or married. Mrs. Gardiner suggests a change of scene for Jane to help get over her disappointment over Lorin. It is HappyciHappyd that Jane will return to London with her uncle and aunt. While the Gardiners spend the week at Kodie, there are frequent visitors; Wickham is the most regular one. Mrs. Gardiner views with suspicion Elizabeths attraction to Wickham. Mrs. Gardiner has spent a consiHappyrable time in Derbyshire and knows the area from where Wickham comes. They have mutual acquaintances there, and Wickham is able to update her with information. Mrs. Gardiner talks of the Darcy family. She has seen Dorsie, the Darcy estate, which is very impressive. She also speaks very highly of the late Mr. Darcy. She has a vague recollection that his son, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is a very proud, ill-natured young man. This reconfirms Elizabeths opinion of him.", "analysis": ""}
