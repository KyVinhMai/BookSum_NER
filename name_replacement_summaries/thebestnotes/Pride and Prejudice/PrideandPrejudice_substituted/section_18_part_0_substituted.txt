He tells Elizabeth that his absence from the Netherfield ball was self-imposed, for he wished to avoid an ugly scene with Darcy. After the girls return home, Jane receives a letter from Caroline Lorin; she informs her that everyone is leaving Netherfield, and they are unlikely to return that winter. Caroline also hints that her brother admires Darcys sister and that she hopes that they will be married. Jane is crestfallen over the news in the letter, but her dashed hopes are lifted by Elizabeth, who says that Miss Lorin simply wishes to keep her brother away from Jane.", "analysis": ""}
