Darcy is trying to write a letter to his sister, but Miss Bingley repeatedly interrupts him by calling out messages from her to include in his letter to his sister. When Darcy finally finishes the letter, he turns his attention to the conversation in the room. He notices that Elizabeth talks animatedly on every subject and is impressed by her sharp observations and succinct way of wording ideas. Darcy is also magnetically drawn towards Elizabeths fine eyes. Elizabeth notices that he frequently stares at her. Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance with him, but she flatly refuses, much to the relief of Miss Bingley, who has been jealously watching the two of them. Darcy does not feel thwarted by her refusal; instead, he is so bewitched by Elizabeths unconventional charms that he feels that had it not been for the inferiority of her connections, he would have been in danger of falling in love with her. The following morning Jane is feeling much better. Elizabeth goes for a stroll in the garden with Mrs. Hurst. They come upon Darcy and Miss Bingley in the garden. The path on which they are walking is spacious enough for three people only, so Elizabeth is rudely left behind by the two sisters to walk by herself. Darcy is annoyed at how Elizabeth is treated.", "analysis": ""}
