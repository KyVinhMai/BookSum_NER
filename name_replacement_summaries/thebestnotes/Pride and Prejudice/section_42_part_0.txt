Wickham, however, has agreed to marry her on the stipulation that his debts are cleared and he is given a stipend of one hundred pounds a year. Mr. Bennet agrees to the offer, but suspects that a much greater amount must have been passed on by Mr. Gardiner to maneuver Wickham to yield. Mrs. Bennet, upon hearing that Lydia is to be married, forgets the disgraceful state of affairs under which the marriage is coming to a pass. She enthusiastically proceeds to make arrangements for a wedding and to convey the glad tidings in the neighborhood.", "analysis": ""}
