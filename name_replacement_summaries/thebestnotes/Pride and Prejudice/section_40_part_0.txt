Elizabeth tells the Gardiners that Lydia knows nothing of Wickhams despicable past and lacks the good sense and strength of character to judge him appropriately on her own. When Elizabeth arrives home, there has been no word from Lydia, and Mr. Bennet, in London, has had no luck finding her. Mrs. Bennet, in hysterics, blames everyone for her suffering. She is still blind to the fact that her over-indulgence with Lydia is the principal cause of her daughters disgrace. To add to the misery at the Bennets, Lady Lucas calls to console them, when in reality she has come to gloat. Lydia writes a letter to Mrs. Forster and says that she and Wickham are going to Gretna Green. Jane and Elizabeth read the letter and share its contents. Mr. Gardiner plans join Mr. Bennet to help in the search for Lydia.", "analysis": ""}
