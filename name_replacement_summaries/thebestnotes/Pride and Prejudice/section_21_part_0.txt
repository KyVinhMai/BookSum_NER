Most of the letter cruelly speaks of Miss Darcy and her many attractions. Caroline also boasts about the growing intimacy between her and her brother Bingley, who is residing with Darcy. Elizabeth still feels that Bingley is being influenced by his sisters, who want to destroy his admiration for Jane. She criticizes Bingley for being so easily swayed and manipulated, but Jane will not listen to any criticism of Bingley, Caroline, or Mrs. Hurst. After the arrival of Carolines letter, the mood at Longbourn is somber. Mr. Wickhams frequent visits seem to alleviate some of the gloom. The entire Bennet family is told about Darcys alleged treatment of Wickham, and everyone accepts his account as factual. Even Jane condemns Darcy; but she still believes there may be extenuating circumstances that are unknown to them.", "analysis": ""}
