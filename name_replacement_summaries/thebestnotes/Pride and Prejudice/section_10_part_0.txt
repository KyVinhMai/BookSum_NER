Mr. Bennet has received a letter from his cousin, Mr. Collins, who will inherit Longbourn after Mr. Bennets death. Mr. Collins, a clergyman, hopes to reconcile the differences between Mr. Bennet and himself. He comes, offering an olive branch of peace, and hopes that his efforts will be accepted. Mrs. Bennet is perturbed over the visit and complains about the cruelty of \"settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favor of a man whom nobody cared anything about\". When Mr. Collins, a tall, swarthy young man of twenty-five, arrives, he heaps indiscriminate praise on everything. He compliments Mrs. Bennet on her cooking and speaks highly of everything about the girls. In every way, he appears to be a peculiar figure.", "analysis": ""}
