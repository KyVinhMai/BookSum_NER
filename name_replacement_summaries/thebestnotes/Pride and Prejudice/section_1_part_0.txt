Still in the dark about her husbands visit, Mrs. Bennet seems ludicrously desperate to have her husband call on the new neighbor, and her husbands incessant talk about Mr. Bingley seems to rub salt over her wounds. As Mrs. Bennet grows more impatient and irritated with her husband, he casually informs his wife and daughters about his visit. They are all astonished at his promptness, and Mrs. Bennet is full of praise for him. She remarks that he is an \"excellent father.\" Mr. Bennet, disgusted with his wifes outburst, leaves the room to take refuge in his study.", "analysis": ""}
