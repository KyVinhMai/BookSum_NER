Mr. Collins, undeterred by Elizabeths rejection, replies that it is usual for young ladies to initially turn down a proposal for marriage. He believes that Elizabeth really wants to accept and intends to do so in the end; as a result, he repeats his proposal. Elizabeth declines again, refuting his arguments. Mr. Collins, however, is blinded by conceit and does not realize that the lady is truly not interested in him. Elizabeth decides she will seek her fathers help if this vulgar suitor continues to believe her repeated refusals are really \"flattering encouragement\".", "analysis": ""}
