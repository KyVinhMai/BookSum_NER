They again set out on their journey, but the sled turns over and is jammed between a tree trunk and a huge rock. When they unharness the dogs to straighten out the tangle, they see One Ear sneaking past them towards the she-wolf, who is playfully luring him into the pack of wolves. Bill prepares his gun, but the wolves are too far away to shoot. Bill sets out after them, fires his last three cartridges, and is overwhelmed by the pack, along with One Ear. Henry is now left to fend for himself and his remaining two dogs. The wolves, unafraid and unhesitating, pursue him. Fire is the only thing he has to keep them away. He spends sleepless nights, throwing fire brands at the wolves every time they get too close. Henry heaves the coffin up into a tree so that the wolves cannot get to it. He prepares himself for longer days, but he lives with paranoia, constantly fearing an attack from the wolves. The she-wolf continues to be the boldest of all, getting very close to Henry. In fact, she comes so close that he singes her fur, much to his satisfaction. The chances for his survival seem remote to Henry. He has resigned himself to the terrifying situation. When the wolves attack, trying to eat him alive, he successfully fights them off with burning coals. In exhaustion, he finally dozes. When he wakes up, he learns that his two remaining dogs have been devoured by the wolves. However, the wolves are gone and he is surrounded by about a dozen men. By a miracle, Henry has survived his Northland Wild ordeal.", "analysis": ""}
