They make their bread with sourdough starter, instead of baking powder or yeast. These men enjoy the sight of the newcomers dogs being mangled to death by White Fang and the other dogs. One man in particular, Beauty Smith, enjoys the fighting. He works for the people at the fort and has his eye on White Fang. He offers to buy White Fang from Gray Beaver, who is at first not willing. Beauty Smith then tempts Gray Beaver with liquor until he is addicted. Gray Beaver is then willing to sell White Fang for a few bottles of whiskey. Gray Beaver hands White Fang over to Beauty, but he escapes three times from captivity and returns to Gray Beaver, only to be betrayed and returned each time. Upon his return, he is beaten by Beauty for his disobedience. Finally, Gray Beaver, sober and bankrupt, leaves for the Mackenzie River, and White Fang cannot follow since he is tied with a chain. After one especially severe beating from Beauty, White Fang falls sick.", "analysis": ""}
