{"name": "chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang14.html", "summary": "This chapter deals with the cubs first encounter with humans. The cub runs down to the stream to drink, and there he notices five creatures he has never seen before. His first instinct is that of fear, yet he does not run away. One of the men approaches the cub and reaches down to seize him, but the cub bites him, for which he receives a blow to his head, causing the cub to cry. When he receives another blow, the she-wolf comes running. One of the Indians calls the she-wolf Kiche, and she submits immediately, much to the cubs dismay. Kiche is the offspring of a wolf father and a dog mother, who was owned by Gray Beavers brother. Kiche ran away from the Indians during the famine a year ago, and since then, she has been with the wolves. Salmon Tongue, Three Eagles, and Gray Beaver decide to take White Fang and Kiche to their camp. Meanwhile, the rest of their clan arrives with their dogs, who do not accept White Fang. Kiche is kept tied, but White Fang is allowed to roam. As he explores the place, he comes across Lip-lip, another puppy, who becomes an instant and constant enemy. When the two pups fight, White Fang is injured and retreats to Kiche, who licks his wounds. When he goes back to exploring, he approaches Gray Beaver, who is making a fire. White Fang burns his nose and tongue when he goes to smell the flames. He yelps pathetically, which causes laughter in the camp. White Fang is ashamed and goes back to his mothers side.", "analysis": ""}
