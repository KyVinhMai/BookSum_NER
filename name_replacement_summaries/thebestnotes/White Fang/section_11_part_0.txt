When the camp members prepare to leave for another place, White Fang escapes into the forest. He enjoys the freedom of the wild for a while, but soon finds himself lonely and scared and longing for the comfort of the camp. In truth, he has lost the knack of hunting and is even scared by a trees shadow. Afraid and desperate, he returns to the camp but finds the Indians have gone. He wails loudly with apprehension. The next morning, White Fang plunges into the forest and follows the stream down to the riverbank. Following the rivers course, White Fang runs for thirty hours. He finally arrives hungry and tired at the new Indian camp. White Fang joins them around the fire, gets his share of meat, and eats it contentedly.", "analysis": ""}
