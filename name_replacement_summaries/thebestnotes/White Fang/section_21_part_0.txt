When they arrive at Scott's country home, they are greeted by Scott's mother, who warmly embraces her son. White Fang sees this as a hostile act and starts to snarl at Scott's mother. Scott has to control the wolf-dog. When White Fang finally goes off to explore his new home, he encounters Collie, the indignant sheepdog, and is attacked by the deerhound, Dick. These animals have no reason to fear White Fang.", "analysis": ""}
