{"name": "chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang18.html", "summary": "Spring arrives, and Gray Beaver finishes the journey. White Fang is one year old, and next to Lip-lip, he is the largest yearling. He continues to have his battles with other dogs. When he fights with Baseek over a piece of shinbone, White Fang rips Baseeks right ear and wounds him on the shoulder. Baseek, old and weak, gives up. In mid-summer, White Fang encounters Kiche, who has now forgotten him and has had a new litter. She hovers protectively around her litter, trying to drive White Fang away. When White Fang is three years old, there is a great famine in the land. Only the strong will survive, for the Indians eat the weaker dogs. The Indians also eat the soft-tanned leather of their moccasins and mittens to fill their stomachs. White Fang escapes into the forest to hunt on his own, at times robbing rabbit snares and at times capturing small game, like squirrels and woodmice. At the end of the famine, White Fang meets Lip-lip, with whom he fights until Lip-lip is killed. He then returns to the village and is received warmly and given plenty of fish.", "analysis": ""}
