{"name": "chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang22.html", "summary": "Although Scott repeatedly tries to gain White Fang's confidence by speaking kind words and patting him gently, White Fang remains wary of him. Gradually, White Fang begins to accept Scott's spoken affection, but he still refuses to be touched or fed by the man. To build trust, Scott throws the pieces of meat, one by one, each landing closer. Cautiously, White Fang retrieves each piece until he is willing to eat from Scott's hand. Matt is highly surprised at the sight of Scott petting the wolf-dog, whose usual response is to snarl and leap backwards. As Scott continues to pet him, White Fang begins to enjoy the affection. He begins to protect Scott, guarding his property and leaping on any nighttime visitors. Soon White Fang learns to distinguish between footsteps so that he can tell the difference between thieves and honest men. White Fang easily proves his superiority to Scott's other dogs, who accept his leadership. He willingly returns to the dog team and becomes the leader of the Klondike sled runners, where he works in single file, on double traces. In late spring, Scott is called away, and White Fang refuses to eat, drink, or sleep. He becomes weak and lets the other dogs harass him. Matt writes Scott a letter informing him of White Fang's condition. As a result, Scott returns, and White Fang regains his health. One night as Matt and Scott are busy playing cribbage, White Fang nabs Beauty Smith in the dark. Apparently, the despicable man has come to steal White Fang, for he has a club and a steel chain with him.", "analysis": ""}
