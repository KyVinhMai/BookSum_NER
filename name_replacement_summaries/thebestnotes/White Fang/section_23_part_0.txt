At first, he is not friendly with the other dogs and vaguely misses the excitement of fighting. When Scott goes out on horseback, White Fang eagerly follows, traveling for miles. Once, Scott falls off his horse and breaks his leg. Unable to move, he orders White Fang to go home, where the dog growls and attracts the attention of his master's wife. He finally convinces the family to follow him back to Scott, but only after barking, which he is reluctant to do. He has not yet adopted all canine habits. White Fang grows more mellow in Sierra Vista. He actually begins to play with Collie and actually misses an outing with Scott in order to be with the sheepdog. He also learns to tolerate laughter when it is issued by Scott.", "analysis": ""}
