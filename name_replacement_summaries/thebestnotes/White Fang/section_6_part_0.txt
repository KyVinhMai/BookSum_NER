It has been impressed upon him that he should not set foot outside the cave. Since instinct is developing in him, he accepts fear as one of the restrictions of life, and he does not go near the mouth of the cave. Once he hears a strange sniffing at the cave, which comes from a wolverine. His mother arrives in time to protect him. One day the cub goes out into the open, rolls down the slope, is dazzled by the light, and starts crying like any frightened puppy. When he finally gains a foothold, he goes on to explore the grassy area that surrounds him. He is frightened by a squirrel and a woodpecker. He comes across a ptarmigan nest, eats the babies , and dares to fight the mother ptarmigan, injuring her. A hawk interrupts the battle, which the ptarmigan seemed to be winning, and kills the bird. The cub then falls into a river. He struggles towards land, swimming for the first time, but is carried downstream where he is safely deposited. He also comes across a weasel with whom he starts a fight. He would have been killed by the mother weasel had it not been for the timely intervention of his own mother. When she kills the weasel, they eat it together.", "analysis": ""}
