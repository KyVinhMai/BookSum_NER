White Fang senses the impending separation and refuses to eat again. Harrol is concerned about the wolf-dog, but he is afraid he will never be tame enough to live in California. The day Harrol is to leave, White Fang is at his heels all the time. Two Indians come and pick up the luggage and take it to the steamboat, Aurora, which is packed with adventurers and gold seekers. Harrol then departs, locking White Fang in the cabin until he has safely sailed away. White Fang, however, breaks free through the window and later appears on board the ship. Harrol, seeing such devotion, finally decides to take him along, despite Matt's warning that the California climate will not suit White Fang.", "analysis": ""}
