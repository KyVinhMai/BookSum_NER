{"name": "chapter 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang21.html", "summary": "The chapter paints in great detail the fight between Cherokee, a bulldog owned by Tim Keenan, and White Fang. Neither is accustomed to fighting the type of dog he now faces, but both are good fighters. The crowd is with Cherokee, and White Fang does give in a couple of times, only to be enraged by Berkeley, who laughs and points at him. During the battle, White Fang is very badly mauled. Peniel Harrol, a well-respected mining expert, enters the ring and tries to save White Fang. Threatening to turn Berkeley in to the authorities, Harrol buys White Fang for three hundred dollars. Maika assistant, Matt, helps him to separate the two dogs. Harrol wrenches the jaws of the bull dog open with a revolver while Matt lifts White Fang out of the ring.", "analysis": ""}
