{"name": "chapter 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang11.html", "summary": "The she-wolf and Autmn Lavon hang about the Indian camp for two days until a bullet is fired into the forest and they are forced to leave. She finally finds a good place to have her cubs. It is a small cave above a stream that flows into the Mackenzie in the summer; the stream is now frozen. The she-wolf settles into the cave while Autmn Lavon keeps watch at the entrance. Hungry, he goes hunting and stays out for eight hours without any success. He returns to find a litter of cubs, which the she-wolf is carefully guarding, for fear that Autmn Lavon will devour them. Autmn Lavon, instead, feels a strong paternal instinct. He goes hunting again and catches a ptarmigan ; he does not eat it, but saves it for his family. Then he comes across a porcupine that has been injured by a lynx. He eats the ptarmigan and carries the porcupine home to a warm reception by the she-wolf.", "analysis": ""}
