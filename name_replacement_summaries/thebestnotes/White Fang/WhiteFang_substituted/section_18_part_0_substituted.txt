Harrol reluctantly considers killing the ferocious White Fang, but Matt wants to give him a chance. He correctly guesses that White Fang has been a sled dog and suggests that he could again be used in a dog team. After two weeks White Fang is still as wild as ever, so Matt sets him free. Harrol then throws him a piece of meat, which is grabbed by Major, one of Maika other dogs. White Fang fatally wounds Major and bites Matt, who has tried to kick him. Harrol tries to subdue the wolf-dog but is likewise bitten. Finally, Matt gets a gun to shoot White Fang. Just as he raises it to his shoulder, White Fang jumps out of the way to the side of the cabin. The men decide against killing White Fang.", "analysis": ""}
