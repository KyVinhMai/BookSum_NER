He is often removed from the pen and made to fight other dogs, including mastiffs, wolves, and huskies. White Fang invariably wins, no matter what kind of dog he faces. Sometimes he has to fight three dogs at once or a freshly caught wolf from the Wild. White Fangs constant victories make him a public figure. He is known as the Fighting wolf, and he is on exhibit in his cage all the time. Beauty Berkeley begins to make money at White Fangs expense. Whenever a fight is arranged, bets are taken. To make certain that White Fang wins, Beauty trains him in the wild. He releases him a few miles from town, usually at night to avoid police interference, and he must fight for survival. Back in captivity, White Fang is forced to fight wolves that have been trapped by Indians, for he has defeated all the available dogs. Autmn time he fights a full-grown female lynx and defeats her.", "analysis": ""}
