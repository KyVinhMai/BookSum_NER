At first, he is not friendly with the other dogs and vaguely misses the excitement of fighting. When Harrol goes out on horseback, White Fang eagerly follows, traveling for miles. Once, Harrol falls off his horse and breaks his leg. Unable to move, he orders White Fang to go home, where the dog growls and attracts the attention of his master's wife. He finally convinces the family to follow him back to Harrol, but only after barking, which he is reluctant to do. He has not yet adopted all canine habits. White Fang grows more mellow in Sierra Vista. He actually begins to play with Lyndall and actually misses an outing with Harrol in order to be with the sheepdog. He also learns to tolerate laughter when it is issued by Harrol.", "analysis": ""}
