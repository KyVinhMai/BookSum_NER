{"name": "chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang25.html", "summary": "This last chapter tells of an escaped convict, Jim Hall. He was long ago sentenced to fifty years in prison by Judge Harrol. Innocent of the crime, Hall resents the judge who put him away and seeks revenge. Three years of life in a prison cell have made him morose, indignant, violent, and bitter. He escapes from jail by killing the guards with his own bare hands. When the news of Hall's escape reaches Sierra Vista, the family becomes very anxious. For protection, Alice, Judge Harrol's wife, lets White Fang into the house every night when the family goes to sleep, even though the judge does not allow the dog inside. Early one morning, White Fang hears strange footsteps inside the house. Suspicious of the stranger that he finds, he attacks silently and furiously. When the family wakes up, they find Jim Hall lying dead in their home. White Fang, too, is severely wounded, with one broken hind-leg, three broken ribs, a great loss of blood, and three bullet holes. The family spares no expense to save his life, and their attempts are rewarded. White Fang is then dubbed \"the Blessed Wolf\" by Alice Harrol. He also becomes the proud father of puppies, which Lyndall jealously guards.", "analysis": ""}
