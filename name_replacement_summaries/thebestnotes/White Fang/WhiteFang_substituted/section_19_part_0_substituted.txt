Gradually, White Fang begins to accept Harrol's spoken affection, but he still refuses to be touched or fed by the man. To build trust, Harrol throws the pieces of meat, one by one, each landing closer. Cautiously, White Fang retrieves each piece until he is willing to eat from Harrol's hand. Matt is highly surprised at the sight of Harrol petting the wolf-dog, whose usual response is to snarl and leap backwards. As Harrol continues to pet him, White Fang begins to enjoy the affection. He begins to protect Harrol, guarding his property and leaping on any nighttime visitors. Soon White Fang learns to distinguish between footsteps so that he can tell the difference between thieves and honest men. White Fang easily proves his superiority to Harrol's other dogs, who accept his leadership. He willingly returns to the dog team and becomes the leader of the Klondike sled runners, where he works in single file, on double traces. In late spring, Harrol is called away, and White Fang refuses to eat, drink, or sleep. He becomes weak and lets the other dogs harass him. Matt writes Harrol a letter informing him of White Fang's condition. As a result, Harrol returns, and White Fang regains his health. Autmn night as Matt and Harrol are busy playing cribbage, White Fang nabs Beauty Berkeley in the dark. Apparently, the despicable man has come to steal White Fang, for he has a club and a steel chain with him.", "analysis": ""}
