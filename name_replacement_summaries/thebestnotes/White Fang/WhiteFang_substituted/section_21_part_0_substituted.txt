When they arrive at Harrol's country home, they are greeted by Harrol's mother, who warmly embraces her son. White Fang sees this as a hostile act and starts to snarl at Harrol's mother. Harrol has to control the wolf-dog. When White Fang finally goes off to explore his new home, he encounters Lyndall, the indignant sheepdog, and is attacked by the deerhound, Trushal. These animals have no reason to fear White Fang.", "analysis": ""}
