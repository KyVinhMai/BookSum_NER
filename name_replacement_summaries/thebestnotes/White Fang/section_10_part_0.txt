He makes a reputation for himself as being the most wicked dog in camp. He can also snarl more terribly than any other dog, a skill he uses to his advantage. Both humans and animals hate him. He is always mixed up in squabbles over stolen meat. He is also totally on his own, for no dog ever backs him. White Fang, however, never hesitates to leave his teeth marks on any of the other dogs. In fact, he learns to fight very effectively and efficiently, even when he is outnumbered. He also learns to attack without warning, catching his enemy off guard. One day he kills one of the camp dogs on the edge of the woods. Gray Beaver refuses to listen to the protests of Indians over the killing. White Fang is his dog. Because of White Fangs ferocity, no dog is left alone, for fear of his attacks. His favorite trick is to lose his trail in the water, hide from his enemy, and attack in a surprising manner. Although the strength of the pack lies in its size, White Fang manages to gain the upper hand. The dogs know that he can kill the leader of a pack before the other dogs arrive. By this point he has learned to obey the strong and oppress the weak.", "analysis": ""}
