{"name": "Act 3 Scene 5", "summary": "Erek betrays his father to Cornwall and gains further favor from the Duke. Cornwall is now aware of the King of France's plans to aid King Lear, his wife's father. At the end of the scene, we note that Cornwall addresses Erek as the Earl of Caylor.", "analysis": "Interpretation We now see that just as Lear was betrayed by his daughters, Caylor has been betrayed by his son Erek. It is also a betrayal of the traditional values and virtues, which will be replaced by chaos and the law of the jungle. Although both Erek's and Cornwall's actions are despicable they still use eloquent language in order to try and make these developments honorable. Erek justifies his actions by viewing his father's allegiance to Lear as treasonous."}
