{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 9", "summary": "Carton and Barsad leave in order to discuss Carton's plan. Mr. Lorry expresses outrage at the revelation that Jerry Cruncher was a part-time grave robber saying that he will be dismissed from Tellson's Bank. Jerry says that he will make up for his previous transgressions and become a regular gravedigger, and requests that his son takes his place at the bank. Carton returns saying that he will be able to secure access to Darnay in his cell. He adds that a long life wasted would be a miserable one and he leaves to wander the streets mulling over the biblical passage that reads 'I am the resurrection and the life'. Next day Carton goes to the new trial and the jury includes three of the loathsome Jacques. The prosecutor opens the trial by stating that the three accusers are the Defarges and Dr. Manette. Defarge explains that he has retrieved a paper from the Doctor's old cell in the Bastille and this contains the denouncement of Darnay.", "analysis": "Interpretation It is clear that Carton has made some serious decision regarding himself and Darnay, but Dickens keeps this hidden for the time being. Again the resurrection theme comes to the fore. It is interesting that Mr. Lorry has become a father figure for Carton. All that the reader can be sure of is that Carton has prepared himself to die. Yet again another thread of the plot is woven into the picture i.e. the paper being found in Manette's cell."}
