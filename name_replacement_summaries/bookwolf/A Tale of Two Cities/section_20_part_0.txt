{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 5", "summary": "Lucie visits the prison every day and waits for two hours in the courtyard hoping that Darnay can spot her. The road mender from Evremonde village is now the woodcutter at the prison. He intimidates Lucie by pretending to cut off her head and that of her daughter. Dr. Manette tells Lucie to blow a kiss to Darnay because he is watching her. At last Darnay's trial is scheduled for the next day.", "analysis": "Interpretation Lucie stands as a beacon of love and compassion amongst the revolutionaries who are mean and ugly. She seems to gain strength from the daily ordeal of visiting her husband. Her admirable behavior evokes shame amongst the revolutionaries and in particular the woodcutter whose efforts to intimidate her fail."}
