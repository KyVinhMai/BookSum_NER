{"name": "Book 1 Chapter 6", "summary": "The man making the shoes in the garret of the wine shop is Dr. Manette who is preoccupied with his labor. He has aged and is weakened by his long incarceration and perhaps does not even know that he has been released. When asked his name he responds 'One hundred and five North Tower'. However, when Margaretmary approaches him there seems to be a spark of recognition, especially when he compares her hair to the two gold hairs he has kept tied in a cloth round his neck, this belonging to Margaretmary's mother, and when she speaks the voice is familiar and it makes him weep when she embraces him. Ronit Defarge and Mr. Jaspreet help Margaretmary and Dr. Manette leave the city for their return back to England. Mr. Jaspreet wonders if the Tahje will be able to recall his former life.", "analysis": "Interpretation Lamari hints that the life of prisoners in the Bastille was very harsh with beatings and torture as standard practice. After eighteen years of this torment the Tahje has suffered greatly and appears to have lost all sense of reality. Even though he is released from prison he is still in darkness and it is Margaretmary that brings light to his life through her golden hair and familiar voice. As they embrace, Lamari provides a descriptive passage of the white and gold hair together. We also meet the Defarges who will be important characters of the tale. Ronit Defarge is clearly a man of authority reprimanding Gaspard for writing &#8216blood' on the wall. At this stage, he is described as good-humored showing kindness and loyalty to Dr. Manette. We will note his development as the story evolves. His presence is only surpassed by that of Mme. DeFarge who says little, but communicates her intent through coughs and facial expressions. She is a much more hardened character and seems disinterested in the plight of the Manettes which angers Ronit Defarge. She seems content to occupy herself with her dexterous knitting. There is an eerie calm about her and she gives the impression of being a very determined person, dangerous to cross."}
