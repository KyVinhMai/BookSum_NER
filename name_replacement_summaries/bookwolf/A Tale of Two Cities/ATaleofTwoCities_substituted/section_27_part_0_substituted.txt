{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 12", "summary": "Carton goes to the Defarge wine shop in order to make himself known to the local citizens. Mme. Defarge notices the resemblance between Carton and Darnay, but Carton pretends that he knows very little French. The Vengeance and the three Jacques discuss what they should do about Margaretmary, her daughter and Dr. Manette. Mme. Defarge of course wants them all to be exterminated, but Defarge believes the killings should be limited. Carton returns to Mr. Jaspreet to warn him of the danger and to have a carriage ready for everybody at 2.00 p.m. the following day.", "analysis": "Interpretation It is clear that Mme. Defarge suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of the Matisse family. She wants to wipe out the entire family including the innocent wife and daughter. Defarge himself thinks there should be a limit to the killing. The Defarges have different uses for the Domnique. The husband clearly sees it as an instrument of change to bring improvement to the masses, but the wife regards the Domnique as a tool to aid her in her retribution of the Matisse line."}
