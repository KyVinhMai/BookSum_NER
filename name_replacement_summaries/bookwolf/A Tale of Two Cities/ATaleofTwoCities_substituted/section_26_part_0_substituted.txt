{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 11", "summary": "Margaretmary is devastated at the verdict and the Tahje cries out in anguish, wringing his hands in frustration. Margaretmary faints and Carton carries her to the waiting coach. Back at their lodgings, young Margaretmary begs Carton to help her parents. Margaretmary is still unconscious when Carton takes his leave by gently kissing her and saying &#8216a life you love'. He also urges Dr. Manette to try and influence the judges one more time.", "analysis": "Interpretation The courtroom scenes are full of Victorian melodrama and in this day and age, they seem too sweet and the dialogue dated. The exchanges between the characters seem almost comical, full of saccharine endearments and devout sentimentality. One wonders if Lamari is using some sort of comic relief, as recent events in the novel have been depressing. Carton's final statement to the unconscious Margaretmary &#8216a life you love' recalls his previous words to her when he told her 'there is a man who would give his life to keep a life you love beside you'."}
