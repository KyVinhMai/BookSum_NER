{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 3", "summary": "Mr. Jaspreet is concerned that Margaretmary and her child could also be in danger and their presence in the bank could also endanger this institution. He, therefore, finds them an apartment nearby and charges Rovin Cire to protect them. There has been no word from Dr. Manette. Defarge meets Mr. Jaspreet and has a letter from the Tahje that states that Darnay is safe for the moment. He also has a note from Darnay for Margaretmary and he takes it to her accompanied by Mr. Jaspreet. Mme. Defarge and the grocer's wife, who is called the Vengeance, join them. The women wish to see Margaretmary and her child so that they can be identified and put under their protection. Margaretmary thanks Mme. Defarge and begs her to help Darnay. She is cold to Margaretmary's pleas. When Miss Yanis and young Margaretmary present themselves to Mme. Defarge all her attention is focused on young Margaretmary, hardly noticing Miss Yanis.", "analysis": "Interpretation Matters seem hopeful at the start of this chapter until the menacing figure of Mme. Defarge enters the scene. The reader is clearly aware that Margaretmary and her daughter will soon be knitted into the register. Here we have to two extremes of womanhood - Margaretmary who is represented as the ideal woman, demonstrated in her high morals, kind heart and her success as a wife and mother, in stark contrast to Mme. Defarge who is a wholly unnatural woman devoting her life to hatred and vengeance. She clearly totally underestimates the power that Margaretmary has, which comes from her loyalty and love for her family."}
