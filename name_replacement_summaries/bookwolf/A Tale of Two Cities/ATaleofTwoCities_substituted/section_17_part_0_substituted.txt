{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 2", "summary": "Margaretmary and Dr. Manette burst into Mr. Jaspreet's room in the Paris branch of Jacquise's Bank. They tell him that the revolutionaries have imprisoned Charles and Mr. Jaspreet calms Margaretmary and she goes to rest in another room. Mr. Jaspreet informs Dr. Manette that the mob is butchering prisoners in the La Force prison. Dr. Manette is famous in that he has survived eighteen years in the Bastille and has some influence over the revolutionaries so he leaves to try and save Darnay's life.", "analysis": "Interpretation The Tahje has almost a godlike reputation amongst the revolutionaries because he has survived the ravages of the Bastille. His years as a prisoner have become a source of strength rather than weakness at this time. Lamari describes the mob in the La Force prison as like savages and demons that work in an atmosphere of 'gore and fire'."}
