{"name": "Book 3 Chapter1", "summary": "Charles Darnay journeys to Paris and in every village along the way he meets bands of revolutionaries who condemn him as an aristocrat being an immigrant. He is allowed to continue only because he shows them the letter from Gabelle. In Paris he learns that he has been declared a prisoner 'in secret' by a prison tribunal, and he is taken to La Force prison. Defarge escorts Darnay to prison and he asks that Mr. Lorry is notified, but Defarge refuses. He is kept in solitary confinement and he is reminded of Dr. Manette's similar plight.", "analysis": "Interpretation It is clear that Darnay has been drawn into the center of a web and his position looks hopeless. The true genius of Dickens comes to the fore now in this book. The previous numerous insignificant storylines start to merge and the reader starts to appreciate how the plot has been masterfully structured. Darnay's journey again shows duality in that it mirrors Mr. Lorry's trip to France in Book 1. Both men travel secretly in an endeavor to free an innocent man from prison. However, this trip by Darnay differs in that Defarge imprisons him, where he assisted Mr. Lorry at the start of the book. Darnay is imprisoned in secret, which means he has no hope of a trial or of contacting his family. It seems he is to be &#8216buried alive."}
