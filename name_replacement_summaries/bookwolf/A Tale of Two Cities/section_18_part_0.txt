{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 3", "summary": "Mr. Lorry is concerned that Lucie and her child could also be in danger and their presence in the bank could also endanger this institution. He, therefore, finds them an apartment nearby and charges Jerry Cruncher to protect them. There has been no word from Dr. Manette. Defarge meets Mr. Lorry and has a letter from the Doctor that states that Darnay is safe for the moment. He also has a note from Darnay for Lucie and he takes it to her accompanied by Mr. Lorry. Mme. Defarge and the grocer's wife, who is called the Vengeance, join them. The women wish to see Lucie and her child so that they can be identified and put under their protection. Lucie thanks Mme. Defarge and begs her to help Darnay. She is cold to Lucie's pleas. When Miss Pross and young Lucie present themselves to Mme. Defarge all her attention is focused on young Lucie, hardly noticing Miss Pross.", "analysis": "Interpretation Matters seem hopeful at the start of this chapter until the menacing figure of Mme. Defarge enters the scene. The reader is clearly aware that Lucie and her daughter will soon be knitted into the register. Here we have to two extremes of womanhood - Lucie who is represented as the ideal woman, demonstrated in her high morals, kind heart and her success as a wife and mother, in stark contrast to Mme. Defarge who is a wholly unnatural woman devoting her life to hatred and vengeance. She clearly totally underestimates the power that Lucie has, which comes from her loyalty and love for her family."}
