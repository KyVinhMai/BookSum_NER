{"name": "Book 1 Chapter 4", "summary": "Mr. Lorry arrives at the Royal George Hotel in Dover and after refreshing himself, spends the day pondering on his mission while he waits for the young woman who is Lucie Manette. She arrives believing that there is some property belonging to her late father in Paris, but Mr. Lorry breaks the news to her that her father is still alive. He is Dr. Manette who has been imprisoned in the Bastille in Paris for the last eighteen years. The French authorities have recently released him and as he was one of Tellson's Bank's clients, Mr. Lorry has been sent to identify him. It is hoped that Lucie will take the responsibility for caring for her father and bringing him back to health. Lucie is taken aback at this news and she faints. A large red-haired woman runs into the room pushing Mr. Lorry aside and going to the young lady's assistance using smelling salts and cold water to revive her.", "analysis": "Interpretation The reader discovers that Mr. Lorry is much more than just a businessman, but a very kind man who is deeply troubled by the news he has to break to Lucie. Mr. Lorry is very apprehensive about his mission, which to him is like digging up a man who has been buried for eighteen years, bringing him back to the real world and to his former life. He hopes that this young lady will be able to help him in his mission when he goes to Paris. Dickens symbolically represents this theme of resurrection by the description of Mr. Lorry awakening in the coach after a dark and restless night. The rising sun that illuminates the world that seemed so foreboding during the stormy night dissolves his troubled dreams. Dickens suggests that bringing this mysterious man back to life will bring light to the masses that live in darkness in Paris."}
