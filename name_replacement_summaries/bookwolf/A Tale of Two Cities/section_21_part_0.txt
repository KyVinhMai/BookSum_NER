{"name": "Book 3 Chapter 6", "summary": "Darnay defends himself in the court and makes a well-planned and well-rehearsed defense of himself. Both Dr. Manette and Mr. Lorry testify on his behalf. The spectators are impressed, and cheer wildly when the jury acquits him. He is reunited with Lucie and his daughter who are proud of what he has accomplished.", "analysis": "Interpretation Dickens describes the relief felt by Lucie at her husband's acquittal. When she puts her head on her father's breast this brings the reader full circle from when the rolls were reversed early in Book 1. Yet again there has been another resurrection and Darnay has emerged from his cell of death. Mme. Defarge sat in the front row of the court and has indelibly recorded Darnay's name in her register. She still casts a shadow over the family's happiness."}
