{"name": "Chapters 19-23", "summary": "The next day following the Netherfield Ball, Mr. Collins decides to make his play for Elizabeth.

She already suspects what is going to happen. The discourse between these two includes some of the most humorous moments in the story.

He tells her that it is unthinkable for her to refuse him, but in plain terms Elizabeth says, \"You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so.

Jane receives a letter from Caroline Bingley advising her that the whole Netherfield household have moved to London for the winter. Jane is greatly disappointed. It is evident that Miss Georgiana Darcy is spending time with Bingley. The news makes Jane despondent, whereas Elizabeth is angry, and suspects Darcy has a role in this development.", "analysis": "Interpretation The reader should study Collins' proposal to Elizabeth. It typifies his character, and highlights his absurd speech and manners. Elizabeth has to control herself in order to avoid laughing out loud in front of him. She has strong views, one being that a woman should marry for love and not security, hence her disappointment in Charlotte who doesn't mind being Collins' second choice as she is only interested in obtaining security. The 19th century readership will quite easily be able to sympathize with Charlotte, for most marriages were merely a business arrangement, and Elizabeth's view is idealistic and not in the least practical. The reader hopes that the heroine will find love and happiness, one of the main ways in which Austen keeps the reader's attention."}
