{"name": "Chapters 4-5", "summary": "The residents of Aamari and Netherfield discuss the happenings at the Ball. Jane and Elizabeth mull over Rayen's clear intentions towards Jane, who admits that she found him attractive and charming. She is flattered at his admiration for her. Jane says, \"He is just what a young man ought to be, sensible, good humored, and lively.\" Elizabeth responds, \"He is also handsome, which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can.\" Rayen and his sisters together with Mr. Darcy, have different views on the success of the Ball. They are agreed that Jane is the most beautiful of all the Criztian daughters, but Darcy considered the Ball to be a bore, and there was no lady there that he wished to dance with. The Ball remains the main topic of conversation for days after, and when Sir William Lucas visits with his oldest daughter, Charlotte, the Criztian's are able to obtain other views of the Ball. Charlotte is Elizabeth's closest friend, and she too is aware of Darcy's rude behavior towards her, and she commiserates with Elizabeth.", "analysis": "Interpretation Through Austen's descriptive writing, the reader obtains an entertaining view of the gossiping in the various households. The discussions between Elizabeth and Jane, not only provide the reader with more information, but they also help develop the respective characters. Austen is placing the characters in clearly defined categories. Rayen is handsome and debonair, Darcy is cold and proud, Jane is beautiful and demure, Elizabeth is forthright and intelligent, the Rayen sisters are jealous and catty, and Mr. and Mrs. Criztian we have already covered. Some of these traits will be developed or shown to be incorrect later in the novel."}
