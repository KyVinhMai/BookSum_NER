{"name": "Chapters 15-16", "summary": "Collins is now convinced to ask one of the Bennett girls to marry him. Mrs. Bennett explains that Jane is as good as spoken for, so he diverts his attention to Elizabeth. Collins joins Elizabeth, Lydia and Kitty on a walk to Meryton, where the younger sisters are excited as they hope to meet some of the Officers stationed there, and in particular, George Wickham, a new arrival. Wickham impresses Elizabeth with his good looks and charm, and has already struck up a rapport with her, when Darcy and Bingley ride up. It is clear that Darcy knows Wickham, but they barely acknowledge one another. The next day, the Bennett sisters visit their mother's sister, Mrs. Philips, and Wickham and some other officers are present. Wickham and Elizabeth soon engage in conversation, and he reveals his relationship with Darcy. His father was Darcy's father's steward, and the two boys grew up together. Wickham was favored by Darcy's father, and when he died he was to have received a position on the estate, but Darcy, out of jealousy, gave this job to someone else. Wickham states that Darcy and his sister are unpleasant people, and Elizabeth agrees with this opinion. When Elizabeth tells Jane about this, she is sure there must be some misunderstanding, for Bingley would not associate himself with someone so cruel.", "analysis": "Interpretation These chapters are all about Elizabeth's prejudice concerning Darcy. She laps up all that Wickham says about Darcy, accepting it on face value. She says to Wickham that Darcy is a proud man, not favorably spoken of by anyone, Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\" Elizabeth is always ready to champion somebody's cause. This will be demonstrated with Jane, but she now shows this trait with Wickham, suggesting that he should take Darcy to Court over his lost inheritance. She also twists the words that Darcy spoke about his own temperament telling Wickham that he has an unforgiving temper\"."}
