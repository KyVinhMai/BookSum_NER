{"name": "Act 4 Scene 4", "summary": "During their voyage to the port, Hamlet and his keepers see Fortinbras leading his army through Denmark to Poland. They will fight over land worth virtually nothing to anybody, and Hamlet wonders at the troops leaving their homes and families to fight over nothing.", "analysis": "Interpretation The fact that these men are willing to give up their lives over a worthless piece of land gives Hamlet justification in pursuing his revenge to its limits, for he has lost his noble father, and this will motivate him to see this task to its conclusion."}
