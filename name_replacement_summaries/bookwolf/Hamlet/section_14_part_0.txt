{"name": "Act 4 Scene 6", "summary": "Horatio receives letters from Hamlet saying that their ship was beset by pirates and that he was taken captive and brought back to Denmark. He has been well treated. He has promised the pirates a favor in return. He has one letter for the King and asks this to be delivered immediately, and then Horatio is to meet him. He has much to tell.", "analysis": "Interpretation If Hamlet suspected Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of deception, then he may have arranged for pirates to prevent their mission. The outcome is, of course, critical to the play's action, for in order to reach the climax, Hamlet must return to the scene."}
