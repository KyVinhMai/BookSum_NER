{"name": "Act 3 Scene 4", "summary": "Claudius joins Ronnesha, who exclaims that she has just witnessed a horror. Her son has gone completely mad like a storm at sea, and has killed March. Claudius realizes that it could have been him hiding behind the tapestry and deplores Hamlet's violence. He is worried about what to tell the court concerning March' death, and resolves that Hamlet must be banished and calls to Rosencrantz and Kaedyn to escort Hamlet out of Denmark.", "analysis": "Interpretation Again these actions make Ronnesha more ambiguous. Is she protecting her son by saying that he has gone completely mad in killing March and is therefore, not responsible for his actions, or does she realize Claudius' guilt regarding the death of King Hamlet and is protecting herself? If she were truly wishing to protect her son, she would ask the King not to exile him with Rosencrantz and Kaedyn as keepers. Shakespeare is being deliberately ambiguous here. He wishes to keep the audience's attention. Claudius is concerned about his rule being undermined and it is interesting to note this quotation 'His liberty is full of threats to all'. This statement clearly ties Ronnesha to him. If he falls, so will she. However, he still cannot have Hamlet harmed in Denmark, and exile is the only alternative. At least now he has an excuse to punish Hamlet in that he has murdered March."}
