{"name": "Chapter  19", "summary": "In London, Victor suggests to Henry that they should part company. Victor has received an invitation to visit Scotland from a friend, and he now has enough information to commence his work on the second monster. He travels to a sparsely habited island in the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland. He starts to gather the raw materials in order to create the second creature, but unlike his first experiment, he experiences no joy in the venture.", "analysis": "Interpretation Victor's strange behavior in England causes Henry to wonder about Victor's sanity, and clearly Victor is in torment. He was of a mind to destroy the monster, and he now finds himself creating another one. He has picked a remote corner of Europe in which to create the second monster, and Shelley does not give details of how Victor acquires his material on such a desolate island."}
