{"name": "Chapter  12", "summary": "The De Lacey family were originally quite well off, and they lived in France. However, they soon fell on hard times and were exiled from France and moved to Germany. The monster becomes a useful helper to the family by secretly hauling wood to the cottage and doing essential repairs at nighttime.", "analysis": "Interpretation At first, the monster cannot understand why the family are unhappy, but he realizes this is a result of poverty and hunger. He decides to help the family as much as possible. He has seen his reflection in a pool of water and knows that he is hideous to look upon, but despite his ugliness, he is able to be a kind and benevolent creature. The De Lacey family is aware that their burdens are easing and attribute this to a \"good spirit\". Shelley is making the point that out of evil, good can grow, and although the creation of the monster in her view was an evil act, the fault does not lie with the monster, but with Victor."}
