{"name": "Chapter  18", "summary": "Before Victor embarks on creating a second monster, he wishes to know what the latest developments are in the scientific world. He, therefore, plans a trip through Europe to London and he will ask Henry Clerval to join him, on the pretext that it will be a holiday. The two depart on their tour, but Victor senses that they are being followed. Eventually the two arrive in London.", "analysis": "Interpretation In Chapter 18, Shelley takes the opportunity of describing her own travelogue through Europe and up the Rhine, the journey being mirrored now in the book by Victor and Henry. Again this chapter provides a respite from the Gothic theme of the novel, and provides the reader with an illustration of the romantic writing prowess of Shelley."}
