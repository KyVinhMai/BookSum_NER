{"name": "Chapter  17", "summary": "The monster perhaps expects Victor to have a solution for both their predicaments, but the monster soon realizes that Victor wishes to be rid of him, and return to a normal way of life. The monster offers him a way out. The monster: \"I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from the entire world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. '''''.. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!\" Victor relents and agrees to recreate a monster to be a mate for him.", "analysis": "Interpretation At first Victor sees a way out of his nightmare when he agrees to provide a creature for the monster as a companion. Just as Victor's doting parents provided a mate for him in the form of Elizabeth, so now Victor will provide a mate for the monster. Shelley makes it clear that the monster's mate is primarily to be for companionship - a platonic relationship - and no mention is made regarding the monster's sexual needs. Shelley clearly puts great store in companionship, for this is mentioned in Walton's letters at the start of the book. It is also interesting how Shelley develops the relationship between Victor and his creation. It is almost like a father/son connection, and Victor eventually gives in to his \"son's\" pleadings."}
