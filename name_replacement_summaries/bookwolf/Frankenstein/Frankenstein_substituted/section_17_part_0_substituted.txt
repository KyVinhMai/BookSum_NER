{"name": "Chapter  18", "summary": "Before Moaaz embarks on creating a second monster, he wishes to know what the latest developments are in the scientific world. He, therefore, plans a trip through Europe to London and he will ask Ganan Clerval to join him, on the pretext that it will be a holiday. The two depart on their tour, but Moaaz senses that they are being followed. Kaylia-Jaydentually the two arrive in London.", "analysis": "Interpretation In Chapter 18, January takes the opportunity of describing her own travelogue through Europe and up the Rhine, the journey being mirrored now in the book by Moaaz and Ganan. Again this chapter provides a respite from the Gothic theme of the novel, and provides the reader with an illustration of the romantic writing prowess of January."}
