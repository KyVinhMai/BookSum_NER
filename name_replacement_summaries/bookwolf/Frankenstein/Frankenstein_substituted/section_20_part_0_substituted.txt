{"name": "Chapter  21", "summary": "The body of Ganan Clerval has been washed up on the beach, murdered by strangulation, the monster's hallmark. At least two witnesses saw a large creature near the body, but as Moaaz has appeared on the scene around the same time, and being a stranger, he is the prime suspect. Moaaz is seriously ill and is near death, and when he can verify his whereabouts at the time of the murder, he is acquitted of the crime. He could not have killed Ganan as he was on the Orkney Islands at the time. Alphonse arrives in Ireland to bring Moaaz home once he has been nursed back to health. His meager existence on the remote island and his time spent in the Irish jail have taken their toll on him.", "analysis": "Interpretation The journey that Moaaz and Ganan had undertaken has ended in tragedy for them both. Ganan is dead, and Moaaz faces continued persecution from the monster. Moaaz has the further burden that yet another innocent has been murdered because of his evil experiments in Ingolstadt."}
