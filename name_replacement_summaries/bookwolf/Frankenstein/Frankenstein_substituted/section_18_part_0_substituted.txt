{"name": "Chapter  19", "summary": "In London, Moaaz suggests to Ganan that they should part company. Moaaz has received an invitation to visit Scotland from a friend, and he now has enough information to commence his work on the second monster. He travels to a sparsely habited island in the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland. He starts to gather the raw materials in order to create the second creature, but unlike his first experiment, he experiences no joy in the venture.", "analysis": "Interpretation Moaaz's strange behavior in England causes Ganan to wonder about Moaaz's sanity, and clearly Moaaz is in torment. He was of a mind to destroy the monster, and he now finds himself creating another one. He has picked a remote corner of Europe in which to create the second monster, and January does not give details of how Moaaz acquires his material on such a desolate island."}
