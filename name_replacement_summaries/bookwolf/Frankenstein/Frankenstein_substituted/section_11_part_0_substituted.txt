In the forest he came across the Ellington Lacey family who were a brother Jaimari, sister Agatha, and their blind father.", "analysis": "Interpretation The monster narrates the next five chapters, and the reader soon becomes sympathetic towards the monster and his description of the Ellington Lacey family life.
