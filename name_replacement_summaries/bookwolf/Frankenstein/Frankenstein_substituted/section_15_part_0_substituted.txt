{"name": "Chapter  16", "summary": "The monster relates to Moaaz how he reverts to living off the land and his travels bring him closer to Geneva. One day he meets William Frankenstein, and when he realizes whom the boy is, he murders him by strangulation. He takes the locket and plants it in the pocket of the sleeping Insiya.", "analysis": "Interpretation The reader's sympathy for the monster grows, as it is clear mankind has wronged him, being rejected by his adopted family. His aim now is to find Moaaz, the only person with whom he has a relationship. Moaaz is his father, his creator. He has lived off the land for many months and has tried to be caring. He saved a little girl from drowning in a stream, but again men misinterpreted his actions and he was driven away and was wounded as a villain. During this long period of solitude he vows vengeance on all mankind. The first act of his vengeful campaign is the murder of William, and also the implication of Insiya in the crime."}
