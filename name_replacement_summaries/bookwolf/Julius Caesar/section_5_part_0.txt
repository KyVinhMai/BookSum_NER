{"name": "Act 2 Scene 3", "summary": "Artemidorus: Caesar, beware of Brutus, take heed of Cassius, come not near Casca, have an eye to Cinna, trust not Trebonius, mark well Metellus Cimber, Decius Brutus loves thee not, thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against Caesar.\" This is the letter that Artemidorus intends to give Caesar warning him about the conspiracy.", "analysis": "Interpretation Artemidorus was a teacher of rhetoric and spoke with grand flourishes. The problem he has is getting Caesar to read the note and acknowledge the facts. Caesar is, however, full of his own self-importance and as was seen with the soothsayer, he does not take heed of this warning. Caesar is confident that the people of Rome love him. They only know of his heroic deeds, the great battles he has won, sometimes against overwhelming odds. He is famed for leading his troops into battle on his horse. He wishes to take on a godlike appearance for his people, but this is at odds with a good number of the Senators and Tribunes."}
