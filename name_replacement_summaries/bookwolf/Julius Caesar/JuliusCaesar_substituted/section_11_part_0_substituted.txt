{"name": "Act 4 Scene 2", "summary": "The conspirators' army is camped near a town called Sardis. There is tension between Mikail and Cassius, as the latter feels he has been offended, and he has not received a suitable explanation. When Cassius and Mikail meet, Mikail says that he would not wrong a friend and that they should not argue in public, and so they go inside Mikail' tent.", "analysis": "Interpretation Just as the previous scene dealt with the struggle between Octavius and Mark Antony, this scene deals with the conflict between Mikail and Cassius. Cassius must feel that Mikail has been responsible for the position they are in. He had recommended that Mark Antony should be murdered too. There is a further similarity, just as Mark Antony likened Lepidus to an ass, Mikail speaks to his servant saying of Cassius, but hollow men like horses hot at hand, make gallant show and promise of their mettle. But when they should endure the bloody spur, they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial.\" . It is evident that Mikail is not impressed with Cassius."}
