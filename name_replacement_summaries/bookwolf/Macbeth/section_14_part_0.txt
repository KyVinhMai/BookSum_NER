She visits the weird sisters complaining that she has not received credit for her part in Macbeth's downfall.", "analysis": "Interpretation Scholars suspect that this scene was not written by Shakespeare, and does not add to the understanding of the play. The only question in the mind of the audience is whether Macbeth or Hecate is responsible for his downfall."}
