{"name": "Act 5 scene 7", "summary": "Siward's son who shows great valor challenges Macbeth, but Macbeth kills him. Macbeth is on the battlefield, but his forces have surrendered Dunsinane Castle, but there is still action left in the play. Macbeth and Macduff come face-to-face. They fight and Macbeth is killed, the tyrannical King of Scotland is no more. The assembled Lords proclaim Malcolm as King of Scotland. There is a fresh air about Dunsinane again; similar to that when King Duncan first arrived. The assembled Lords proclaim Malcolm as King of Scotland. There is a fresh air about Dunsinane again; similar to that when King Duncan first arrived.", "analysis": "Interpretation When Macbeth fights Siward's son, there would be a doubt in his mind whether he would prevail. Before they actually fight, there is a combat of words during which young Siward taunts Macbeth calling him a liar and a devil. After Macbeth has killed young Siward, he mocks the body by saying \"Thou wast born of woman\". Just then, Macduff enters determined to gain revenge for the loss of his family and with the hope that he will assuage his guilt. He describes the surrender of Macbeth's castle brought about by the action of Siward. Macbeth feels trapped at this stage. He describes himself as a badgered bear. Macduff challenges him by saying \"turn, hellhound, turn\". Macbeth warns Macduff that he is invincible. He has a protective charm, which will keep him safe from physical injury. Macduff reveals to Macbeth that he entered the world by being \"untimely rip&#8217d\" from his mother's womb. Strictly speaking, he was not born of woman. Macbeth finally realizes that his struggle is over, and Macduff kills him. Macbeth's folly was in his interpretation of the prophecies he received. He perhaps should have paid attention to his own words in Scene.iii of Act I where he called the weird sisters \"imperfect speakers\". In truth he did not listen to them carefully, he only heard what he desired to know. He also thought that their prophecy was merely stating fact cannot be ill; cannot be good\". Clearly, the sisters were evil and he should not have allowed himself to be tempted and cajoled by his wife. There is an air of celebration now, and Malcolm pays tribute to those that are absent. It is clear that he will be a gracious and good ruler in stark contrast to the tyrant Macbeth. The circumstances regarding young Siward's death are made clear and his sacrifice is appreciated. Old Siward is gratified to learn that his son was killed facing his enemy and not running away. He is described as God's soldier who faced up against the powers of evil. Macduff enters the castle with Macbeth's decapitated head. Macbeth was a victim of his own poison. Malcolm is to be crowned King of Scots at Scone. Malcolm closes the play with the words \"Of this dead butcher, and his fiend like Queen, who by self and violent hands took off her life. This, and what needful else that calls upon us by the grace of Grace . Shakespeare's parting lines have a clear message to all monarchs including James I of England that they cannot rule except by the grace of God. others think of your teachers"}
