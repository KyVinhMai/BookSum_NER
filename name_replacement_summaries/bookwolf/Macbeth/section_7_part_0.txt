{"name": "Act 2 scene 2", "summary": "Lady Macbeth had successfully completed her part of the plot by drugging Duncan's guards. She meets with her husband as he emerges from the King's room. He is in turmoil regarding the deed he has committed and again his wife scolds him for his lack of firmness. Lady Macbeth is alarmed to see that Macbeth has brought the daggers with him, as it is essential that they remain at the scene of the crime. She returns to the scene and smears the King's sleeping servants with blood. She is unaffected by the horror of the scene, unlike her husband. The scene ends with a loud knocking at the castle door.", "analysis": "Interpretation Lady Macbeth's performance in this scene is full of excitement and emotion. She is clearly keyed up with the prospect of success for the murder plot. She is described as being drunk with boldness and on fire with passion. However, she is still concerned that they will be discovered and like her husband is agitated by the slightest noise or movement in the darkness. One of the reasons that she urges her husband to actually commit the murder is because Duncan resembles her own father, so in fact Macbeth has done what she was unable to do. Macbeth makes an interesting comment in that in murdering Duncan, he has also murdered sleep. He will sleep no more. He will never rest easy in his own bed. Lady Macbeth rebukes her husband for having such thoughts, but ironically, it will be her that can gain no sleep which will lead to her own madness. Another matter that a haunt Macbeth is the bloodiness of the deed and that his own hands bear witness to the murder. Lady Macbeth responds that blood is like paint used to daub a picture of death, and can be easily washed off."}
