The old woman did not know how to handle children and Amy was miserable. After a time she became friends with the French maid, Ester, formerly Estelle, and Ester let her play with all of Aunt March's old clothes and some jewelry. Amy was fascinated by the jewelry and Ester confided in her that she and her sisters would be given the possessions when her aunt died. Amy decided she would be very good for Aunt March so she could earn some of the nicest jewels. Amy was overjoyed but still very sad about Beth. Since Ester was Catholic and extremely pious, she told Amy that she found solace in her prayers. At Amy's request, she built a small prayer room for Amy in a closet next to her room in which she could pray for her sister. She also decided that she would make a will of her own, and had Ester and Laurie, when he came to visit her, be a witness to it. Laurie told her sad news about Beth but informed her everything would be all right", "analysis": ""}
