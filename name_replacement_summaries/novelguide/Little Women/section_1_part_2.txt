Looking up into his window, she realizes he has been sick and throws a snowball at his window to get his attention. He opens it and they begin talking. Realizing that he has been lonely, Jo offers to come over and keep him company. This excites Laurie, and he hurries to clean up his rooms before she gets there. Jo asks Marmee permission and after receiving it and a few gifts to bring over to the sick boy, she walks to the house next door. Jo spends the afternoon entertaining Laurie. He is grateful, and when his grandfather gets home, the old man is very impressed by Jo and thankful she came to visit. Laurie promises to come visit the March household when he feels better. Being the consummate storyteller, when she returns home that night, Jo regales the family with her tales of the afternoon", "analysis": ""}
