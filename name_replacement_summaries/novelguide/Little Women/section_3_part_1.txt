Meg, since she was the oldest, was the president of the club, and every week they published a newspaper each with their own contributions. One such week, Meg read the paper, and Jo proposed a motion to add Laurie as a new member. Jo and Beth were in favor of it, but Amy and Meg were not. Jo argued for him however and they finally consented. Laurie popped out of the closet as a surprise and everyone was mad at Jo for not telling he was in there. He then told them of the post office that was built in the yard between their houses, and it became a way for everyone including Mr. Laurence, Hannah, and the Laurence's gardener to pass notes and possessions", "analysis": ""}
