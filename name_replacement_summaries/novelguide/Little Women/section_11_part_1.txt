She neglected John and her housework to take care of the babies, and after a while John began spending his evenings away from home at the Scott's house. Six months went by and nothing seemed to improve. Finally, Marmee came over one day to find Meg crying. She asked what was the matter and Meg told her that John never spent any time at home or with her anymore. Marmee made her see that it was partly her fault for neglecting him, and told her eldest daughter to let John help more with the kids. She also offered Hannah's services as a nurse so Meg could get a break from the babies. Meg consented and when John came home, he found a prettily dressed and attentive wife. Demi, however, made the evening difficult by refusing to go bed. John stepped in however, and used his authority as father and made him go to bed. Meg was thankful for the help, and that evening she tried discussing politics with him, which he was passionate about, and he was grateful for her interest. She then told him about her conversation with her mother, and after that, the house became a much happier place for the both of them", "analysis": ""}
