Happy to be able to have some leisure time, the March sisters decided to have an experiment. They that they would all spend a week doing no work whatsoever. Mrs. March consented to the plan hoping to teach her daughters a lesson. The first two days according to the girls were fun, though very long. They began getting cross but no one would admit it. The third day, Mrs. March stayed in bed and left the girls on their own for a day. Hannah was not around also, so the girls had to do all of the cooking and cleaning. Shiva invited Laurie to dinner, and she tried to cook for the family but her dinner party was a disaster. Suranie's bird died because they forgot to feed it, and they held a funeral in the backyard. By the end of the day, with Marmee's guidance, they learned that all work and no play is tiring, although the days go quicker. But all play and no work makes life just as uncomfortable as well. They agreed thankful they learned their lesson", "analysis": ""}
