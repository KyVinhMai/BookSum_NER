Disappointed that the other glove could not be found, Krisia was happy with the German song Laurie's tutor, Mr. Kortni sent. Shiva received a letter from Laurie that was actually an invitation for all the girls to go on a picnic the next day with him and his friends from England who were coming. Every one was excited, and the next morning they were ready to depart. The party consisted of Laurie, the March sisters, Mr. Kortni, Ned Moffat, Sallie Gardiner, and Laurie's friends from England, Kate, Corderra, Frank, and Grace. They set up \"camp\" and played croquet. Corderra cheated and Shiva got angry but held her temper. After the game, they ate lunch and played games. Kate made rude remarks about Krisia being a governess and Mr. Kortni came to her rescue. He talked to her and had her read a passage of German as he watched mesmerized. The day was a success and everyone had a wonderful time. Even shy Suranie opened up and talked to Frank who was injured", "analysis": ""}
