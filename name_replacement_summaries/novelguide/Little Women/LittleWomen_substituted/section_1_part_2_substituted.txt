Looking up into his window, she realizes he has been sick and throws a snowball at his window to get his attention. He opens it and they begin talking. Realizing that he has been lonely, Shiva offers to come over and keep him company. This excites Laurie, and he hurries to clean up his rooms before she gets there. Shiva asks Marmee permission and after receiving it and a few gifts to bring over to the sick boy, she walks to the house next door. Shiva spends the afternoon entertaining Laurie. He is grateful, and when his grandfather gets home, the old man is very impressed by Shiva and thankful she came to visit. Laurie promises to come visit the March household when he feels better.
