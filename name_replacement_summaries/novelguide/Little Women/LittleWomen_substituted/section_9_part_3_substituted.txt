She left the story there, asking the man if he would look it over and consider publishing it. He told her to come back in a week and a week later when she did, he told her he would publish it if she cut out all of the moral lessons in it. Shiva agreed and received twenty-five dollars for her work. After that she continued writing \"sensation\" stories, and became more swept up in the lives of her characters she had to research. During this time, she became a better friend with Professor Bhaer and one day as he was giving her a German lesson; Shiva began laughing at him. Upon his head, Tina- one of the children in the house that adored Bhaer- had placed a paper cap on his head. When he discovered the paper, the professor laughed until he saw it was a sensation newspaper of which he did not approve. Professor Bhaer made Shiva feel guilty about writing for the paper, although he did not know. What Shiva did not know was that Professor Bhaer had guessed that she wrote for the papers. After that Shiva tried to write tales with moral, then children's stories, but neither suited her and she gave up writing for a time. When June came along, it was time for Shiva to go back to her family. She said goodbye to everyone, and she extended the invitation to Bhaer to come visit her and her family. Bhaer was going to miss her, and she him, and he told her that he would come. Shiva was happy because she had made such a good friend", "analysis": ""}
