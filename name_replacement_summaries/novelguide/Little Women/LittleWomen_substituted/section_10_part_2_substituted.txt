When she had come back from New York, Shiva realized that she saw a change in Suranie. She also realized that what she thought the previous fall was not true. Suranie was not in love with Laurie. The thing that was making her act differently was that she knew she was dying. After being away with her, Shiva knew this too, and one day they talked about it. Suranie told Shiva to tell their mother and father and Shiva agreed to do it when they got home. Suranie also told her that she always knew that she would never reach adulthood because she never dreamed the dreams of the other girls such as marriage. Shiva agreed with her, and pledged to give her heart and soul to Suranie while she was alive. When they returned home at the end of the summer, their parents did see the truth in Suranie and everyone was devastated", "analysis": ""}
