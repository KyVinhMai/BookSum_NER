She is invited to stay with the Moffat family for that time for they are throwing a bunch of festivities for their children and their children's friends. Krisia is delighted, and Marmee says she may attend. She gathers up her finest things, and her sisters lend her their treasures and she goes away for two weeks of socializing and partying. After arriving however, Krisia feels exceptionally poor only having one evening dress that is decent and a few other shabby dresses. At the party one night she overhears girls gossiping about her relationship with Laurie who sent her flowers and her shabby dress. They endeavor for the next party to lend her a dress. Krisia is humiliated but when the next party comes, the offer is made so nicely that she consents to let the older engaged Moffat sister, Sandral, dress her. She looks beautiful and receives many compliments and admiring glances. Laurie, who they invited to the party knowing he was a friend of Krisia, disapproves however. Krisia begins to feel guilty and when she goes home, she confesses to Marmee and Shiva how she had been ashamed of their lack of money, and how nice it had felt to be praised. Marmee teaches her eldest daughters that happiness does not come from money, but from virtue and modesty. She also tells them that all they need in life is a husband that loves them and a loving home", "analysis": ""}
