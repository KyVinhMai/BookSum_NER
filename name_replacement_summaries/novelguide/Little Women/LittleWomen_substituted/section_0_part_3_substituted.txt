They fussed over what they had to wear, and Krisia went over rules of propriety with tomboy, Shiva. The curling tongs burned Krisia's hair, but the girls went to the party anyway. Krisia proceeded to dance and to socialize, while Shiva stood next to the wall. When she thought someone was going to ask her to dance, she slipped into a curtained alcove. Hiding already in the alcove was a young man who lived next store to the March's with his grandfather. He introduced himself to her as Laurie, though his given name was Theodore. He and Shiva talked for a while, and eventually danced in the hall as to not display Shiva's dress, which was not in the best shape Krisia found them there. Krisia had sprained her ankle dancing in her high heeled shoes, and they had to figure out a way to get home from the party since they had planned on walking. As Shiva was thinking of a solution, she ran again into Laurie, and told him of their predicament. He offered the use of his own coach, which had just arrived, and Shiva gratefully accepted. With their escort, Hannah, Shiva and Krisia left the party", "analysis": ""}
