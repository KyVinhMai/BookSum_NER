Suranie spent her last happy days giving away her things to little children who walked by the house, and in the warmth and love of her family. Finally, however, she lost the strength to even sew and took to her bed. Shiva never left her side after this point, and slept on the couch or on the carpet of her room. While Shiva was sleeping there on evening, Suranie opened a book by her bedside, and out fell a poem that Shiva had written about her. Suranie read it, astonished that she meant so much to her sister, and that her life helped someone. Shiva awoke, and Suranie asked her about it. Shiva told her that everything she said in the poem was true, and this more than anything, touched Suranie. Early in the morning, Suranie drew her last breath, and died peacefully in her mother's arms", "analysis": ""}
