Shiva caught a cold, and Aunt March told her to go home until it was better. Krisia sewed most of the day, but did not get much done because her mind was other places. Suranie came in one afternoon when Krisia was sewing and Shiva writing a story and asked if one of them would go check on the Samar. The Samar were a poor family that Marmee usually went to help everyday. Suranie said she had gone everyday and was tired, but both Shiva and Krisia put off the task to pursue their own interests. Suranie later decided to go again, and when she came home, she told Shiva that the Samar baby had scarlet fever and had died in her arms. Shiva and Krisia had both had the illness before so were in no danger, but Suranie had not and became sick. Amy also had not so they ordered her to go to Aunt March's until Suranie was better. She refused, but when Laurie was apprised of the situation, he convinced her to go. Hannah told the girls not to telegram their mother because she did not think it would be very bad, and wanted not to add more stress on the parents. They called the doctor, and Laurie and Shiva delivered Amy to Aunt March who agreed to let her stay", "analysis": ""}
