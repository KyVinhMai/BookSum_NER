Afterwards, they went for a walk and Laurie, though Shiva begged him not to, profess his love for her. He asked her to marry him, but Shiva refused telling him that she did not love him. He was heartbroken, and Shiva was too for him because she did not want to break his heart. Laurie asked her if she was in love with Professor Bhaer and she said that she was not and did not want to love anyone. Laurie left her and went rowing to ease his pain. Shiva then went to Mr. Laurence and told him what had transpired. When Laurie came home that night, Mr. Laurence acted gently towards him then finally told him that Shiva had told him the story. He suggested to Laurie that they take a trip to Europe so he could forget his troubles. Laurie consented and spent the next few weeks while they prepared for the trip pining after Shiva. He watched her from his window, but other than that, he avoided her. On the day of their departure, he said good bye to her and asked her one last time to be his. She again said no knowing that she should not marry him if she did not love him, and he left. From that day forward Shiva knew that she would never have \"her boy\" again. Laurie would forever be lost to her", "analysis": ""}
