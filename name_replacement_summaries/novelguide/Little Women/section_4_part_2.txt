She walks down to the town newspaper office, and frets outside about whether or not to enter. Finally she summons the courage and goes in, not knowing that across the street Laurie was watching from the pool hall window. When she comes out, he corners her and asks her why she went. She made him swear not to tell anyone, and he agreed. She then told him that she had submitted two stories to the newspaper, and she would find out in a week whether or not they would be published. In return for her confidence, Laurie told her that his tutor, Mr. Brooke was the one who had Meg's missing gray glove and he kept it in his side pocket. Jo did not like that at all, and stopped liking Mr. Brooke. She wanted her sister to be with a rich man so she could have nice things, and Mr. Brooke would never be rich. Jo and Laurie raced down the road, and while she was recovering, Laurie gathered her hairpins that had fallen out. Meg came upon them and chastised Jo for racing because it was unladylike. A few weeks later, the girls were sitting in the parlor sewing when Jo offered to read them a story from the newspaper. Everyone liked and she declared that she was the one who wrote it. They all were excited, and she told them that she did not get any money for it, but it was publicity", "analysis": ""}
