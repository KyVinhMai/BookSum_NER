She tells them that it is fashionable at her school for girls to share and give away limes to other girls. She so far, has excepted these gifts, but has not been able to return the favor. Meg gives her a quarter so she can buy limes to share the next day. Amy takes the limes to school and everyone is very excited that they will get to partake in her treat at recess. Amy's archenemy, Jenny Snow, found out about the limes, and informed their teacher, Mr. Davis. The previous week he had forbidden the limes. He made Amy throw them out the window, and then he slapped her on the palm with a ruler, and made her stand for fifteen minutes up in front of the entire class. Amy was so humiliated that at recess she went home and did not come back. Jo went to collect her things, and Mrs. March said that she would look into a different school for Amy because she did not believe in corporal punishment. Laurie while playing chess with Jo gave Beth a compliment on the music she had composed and she was extremely shocked and surprised that he knew she wrote music", "analysis": ""}
