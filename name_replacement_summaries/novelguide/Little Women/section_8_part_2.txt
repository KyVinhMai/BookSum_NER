While she was setting up the day before the fair however, Mrs. Chester approached her. She said that the table Amy was running should really go to her daughter. Amy was disappointed, and knew that May, Mrs. Chester's daughter was mad at her for something. She gave the table up gracefully, and succumbed to running the table that sold flowers that no one visited. Hearing of her sister's misfortune, Jo enlisted Laurie and his friends to come and keep her company the following day. The next day they all came and had a wonderful time, and at the end of the day, May Chester was ready to forgive and forget Amy for the grievance she had felt. This made Amy happy. The next week, Mrs. March received a letter from her Aunt Carrol asking Amy to accompany her to Europe. Jo was disappointed that she was not picked, but tried to be happy for her sister. Amy was ecstatic and planned to use the trip to start her off as an artist", "analysis": ""}
