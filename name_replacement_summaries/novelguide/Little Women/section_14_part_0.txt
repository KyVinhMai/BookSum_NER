Jo was grateful and instead of selling it like everyone thought she would, she decided that she and Bhaer would open a school for both rich and orphaned boys. The school was a success, and after five years, she had a wonderful life, and children of her own. The family was all out picking apples from the orchard one day, when they realized that everyone's \"Castles In The Sky\" had changed, but all of the girls were sublimely happy with their lives. They thanked their mother who was also there, for the lessons she taught them because the little women they were had grown up to be the happiest women imaginable.", "analysis": ""}
