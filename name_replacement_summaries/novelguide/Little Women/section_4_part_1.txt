Having nothing interesting to do, and craving a distraction, he followed them into the woods where he found them each working on a project. Meg was sewing, Jo crocheting and reading, Beth was arranging acorns, and Amy was drawing. When he was spotted, they said he could stay but he would have to make himself useful. He took over Jo's job of reading. After their story was done, they discussed what they would like to do with their lives. Laurie wanted to live in Germany and be a famous musician, Meg wanted to have a beautiful house and be rich, Jo wanted to be a famous author, Beth wanted to stay at home, and Amy wanted to be a famous artist. They then discussed Mr. Brooke who had given up his dreams to stay at home and take care of his mother. Everyone thought well of him for it, and Laurie decided finally, that he too would do whatever it takes to make his grandfather happy, and that he would never leave the old man alone", "analysis": ""}
