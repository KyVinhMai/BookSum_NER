She told him that anytime he wanted to bring a colleague home for dinner, that she would not mind, even if he gave her no notice. One summer day Meg slaved over making jelly, but whatever she did, it would not jell. John, not knowing of her troubles, decided to bring his friend Mr. Scott home. When he arrived and told Meg that his guest was waiting outside, Meg blew up at his thoughtlessness. She went into her room and cried as John and his guest ate. Both felt the need to apologize but neither wanted to be the first to do it. Meg finally caved in and peace was settled between them. Meg began spending a lot of her time with Sallie Moffat and in doing so, began spending money. Normally the things she bought were small but one day she found a silk dress that was on sale and bought it. She felt guilty immediately afterwards, and when she showed John her books at the end of the quarter, he was disappointed with her. He canceled his own order for a new coat, which made Meg more guilty. Finally, after being somewhat estranged from him, she went to Sallie and asked if she would buy the dress from her. Sallie did, then gave her the dress as a gift, and Meg ordered her husband's coat. Everything was better, and when Midsummer came along, she gave birth to twins. The boy was named John with a nickname of Demi and the girl was Margaret who they called, Daisy", "analysis": ""}
