Beth spent her last happy days giving away her things to little children who walked by the house, and in the warmth and love of her family. Finally, however, she lost the strength to even sew and took to her bed. Jo never left her side after this point, and slept on the couch or on the carpet of her room. While Jo was sleeping there on evening, Beth opened a book by her bedside, and out fell a poem that Jo had written about her. Beth read it, astonished that she meant so much to her sister, and that her life helped someone. Jo awoke, and Beth asked her about it. Jo told her that everything she said in the poem was true, and this more than anything, touched Beth. Early in the morning, Beth drew her last breath, and died peacefully in her mother's arms", "analysis": ""}
