Because she was a lady however, she did not show her annoyance and spent the majority of her time with him. One day they took a drive together so Amy could draw, and she brought up her problems with him. She told him he was lazy, and that he was wasting his life away. He shrugged her comments off for a moment until they actually started hurting him, and he realized then that the way he was living his life was wrong. Amy discerned that his problems stemmed from a broken heart, and finally realized Jo was the one who had broken it. They talked about it, and Laurie, still unhappy with but grateful to Amy for her comments, said he would change. The next morning Amy found a note from him, saying he had neglected his duties long enough and he had gone back to his grandfather. Amy was happy he was getting his life back on track, but sad to lose his company", "analysis": ""}
