She had not been prepared at all for being greeted by a half-naked George at the pond, and it has destroyed all her plans for greeting him in a proper way. At tea with a neighbor, Cecil is snobbish to the point of being uncivil, and Mrs. Honeychurch notices. Lucy defends Cecil by saying that he has a high standard for people, and Mrs. Butterworth is tiresome. Cecil has told you to think so,\" her mother counters, pointing out that Lucy used to love Mrs. Butterworth, who cared for her when she had typhoid fever. Mrs. Honeychurch has also noticed Cecil's annoyance with her and Freddy. Lucy is upset and embarrassed; she knows that Cecil meant to be supercilious, and has succeeded. Freddy returns from swimming delighted with the Emersons, and plans to invite them for tennis on Sunday. Lucy discourages him, saying that there is too much of a \"muddle\" at the moment. Lucy's mother questions her about what was in Charlotte's letter, but Lucy cannot tell her everything; she only distracts her mother by bringing up Miss Lavish, whom Charlotte had mentioned in her letter. Mrs. Honeychurch abhors the idea of women novelists, thinking that women should mind their homes and children rather than seek fame in print. Although Lucy tries to tell herself that the kiss George Emerson gave her was nothing, she is uneasy with all these ghosts from the past coming out--Charlotte and her knowledge being one of them. Now Lucy's mother wants to invite Charlotte to stay at the house while plumbing work is being done at her place in Tunbridge Wells, and this makes Lucy nervous. Lucy and Cecil object, but Charlotte is to come anyway", "analysis": ""}
