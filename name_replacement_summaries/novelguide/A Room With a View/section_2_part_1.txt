While out running errands, Charlotte and Lucy see Miss Lavish in the Piazza, at the site of the murder. She asks Lucy to tell her what she witnessed, explaining that she will use the incident in her novel, which is to be about love, murder, abduction, and revenge. Lucy prefers not to talk about the murder. She hopes Miss Lavish will not use her as a character in it. Mr. Eager finds the ladies in the square and invites them for a drive in the hills. He, too, asks Lucy for details about the murder, causing Lucy to wonder at \"the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood. Bothered by a photo vendor, Mr. Eager brushes him away rudely, inadvertently tearing one of his photos. Lucy decides that she no longer respects either Miss Lavish or Mr. Eager. Mr. Eager begins talking about the Emersons, hinting that he knows something terrible about them. Pressed by Lucy, the chaplain blurts out that Mr. Emerson murdered his wife, although he provides no evidence for the outrageous claim. After they say goodbye to Mr. Eager, Lucy and Charlotte discuss the drive he has proposed to take them on. They believe it will be a disaster, as Miss Lavish, invited by Mr. Beebe, will also be going, and Mr. Eager doesn't approve of her. Lucy impetuously says that she is sick of Florence, and proposes that they leave at once for Rome to stay in a hotel with her mother's friends. Both of them laugh at the impractical idea", "analysis": ""}
