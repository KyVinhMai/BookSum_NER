A storm is coming, but George insists that he will walk home. Back at the hotel, Lucy pours out her heart to her cousin. To Lucy's horror, Charlotte suggests that George has had many exploits and that he will talk about his \"conquest. She hints that if she had not arrived on the scene, George would have taken advantage of Lucy. Lucy wishes to speak to George to straighten out the matter, but Charlotte will not allow it. She decides that they will catch the train to Rome first thing in the morning, and stay at the hotel with Lucy's mother's friends, the Vyses. They pack their things, and Lucy promises to Charlotte that she will never mention the incident to her mother, lest her mother blame Charlotte for leaving her alone. Charlotte has a word with George, presumably to tell him to stay away from Lucy, and the two leave the next morning", "analysis": ""}
