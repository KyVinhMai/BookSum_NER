Lucy's father had been a prosperous local lawyer who built Windy Corner before the area had been developed. When wealthy Londoners moved to the area and built their mansions, they mistook the Honeychurches for country aristocrats instead of the nouveau riche they really were, and therefore, Lucy had been accepted into the higher society of the area. Now after having been to Italy, Lucy sees that this society is rather narrow, but she still has a great affection for it, and cannot despise it. Cecil wants to introduce her to broader society, but fails to see that Lucy is beyond that; all she really wants to find is a soul mate, an equal partner. Lucy and Minnie Beebe play bumble-puppy, a silly game with tennis balls, while talking to Mr. Beebe and Mrs. Honeychurch about the Miss Alans, who are planning to move into Cissie Villa. Meanwhile, Cecil stays inside, to avoid being hurt as the game deteriorates into roughhousing. Freddy announces that it is not the Miss Alans, but a family called Emerson, who are going to live in the villa. Lucy is shocked to find that the Emersons are none other than George and his father, who have been invited by Cecil as a joke on Sir Harry, as Cecil thought them very vulgar. Cecil claims that he believes in democracy and wants to punish a snob, but Lucy is angry that he has spoiled her work in inviting the Miss Alans and made her look bad", "analysis": ""}
