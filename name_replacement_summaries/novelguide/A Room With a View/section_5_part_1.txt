As Lucy asserts herself, it seems to Cecil that she has changed from a Leonardo painting to a living woman and become even more real and desirable. He exclaims that he loves her and presses her to tell why she doesn't love him. Lucy repeats to him the phrases that George used: \"you're the sort who can't know any one intimately. you're always protecting me. I won't be protected. I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right. This is the crux of the reason why she cannot be with Cecil: he cannot view her as an equal; he wants to stifle her. Cecil realizes in a rush of insight that she is right about him and admires her more than ever. She insists that there is no one else, and he believes her. Having lied to both George and Cecil, Lucy decides that she will never marry. She will live her life alone, a decision that Miss Bartlett made thirty years before. The narrator makes clear that by making this decision, she is sinning against love and entering a period of darkness", "analysis": ""}
