She has seen George Emerson again. His voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him, but rather than recognize that she is in love with him, Lucy tells herself it is a trick of the nerves. The house is full: Charlotte has arrived and is quickly on everyone's nerves; Minnie Beebe is staying with the family because of a diphteria epidemic; and Freddy has a friend, Mr. Floyd, staying there as well. Charlotte confronts Lucy, again urging her to tell about George, lest Cecil hear it from some other source.
