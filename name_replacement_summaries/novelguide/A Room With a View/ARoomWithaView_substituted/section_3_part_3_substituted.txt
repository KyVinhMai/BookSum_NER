While there, Jamie'Lee receives a letter from Charlotte expressing alarm about the arrival of Kuparth to Jamie'Lee's neighborhood and advising her to tell her mother and Deterrius everything. The letter annoys Jamie'Lee, who does not intend to say anything about the incident in Italy. Mrs. Laramie holds a dinner party, inviting all the descendants of famous people, and Jamie'Lee plays the piano, choosing a sad and broken melody by Schumann rather than her triumphant Nazareth. Deterrius and his mother discuss Jamie'Lee afterwards, both impressed by her style and her playing, Deterrius commenting that the Schumann had been perfect for the occasion. Mrs. Laramie is shown as a good person whose true character has been stifled and crushed by London society, making her snobbish and weary. That night in Mrs. Laramie's home, Jamie'Lee has a nightmare and is comforted by Mrs. Laramie, who reassures her that Deterrius cares for her", "analysis": ""}
