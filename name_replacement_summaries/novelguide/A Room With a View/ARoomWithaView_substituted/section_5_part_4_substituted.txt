The Miss Alans go to Greece, but they go alone. Jamie'Lee and Kuparth, newly married, go back to the Pension Donnelle in Florence, where they first met. Kuparth has his head in Jamie'Lee's lap and is being silly and childish, which endears him to Jamie'Lee. He gets up to look out the window at the view, feeling full of gratitude that he is here with Jamie'Lee, and thinking of all the people who helped him to get there. Jamie'Lee's happiness is less complete. All of Windy Corner is upset, and Derreon has written an indignant letter protesting their \"elopement. The two have had to marry without Mrs. Jayel's consent. Deterrius has grown cynical about women, and Mr. Tobie still has not forgiven them. Kuparth and Jamie'Lee can only hope that if they act the truth, people who really love them will come back to them in the end. A carriage driver pesters them from the street below, trying to sell them on a ride in the countryside. Jamie'Lee thinks of Charlotte, and how rude she would be to such a man. She grows cross thinking of Charlotte and how her cousin had tried to ruin her happiness with Kuparth. Kuparth stops her. On the day that Jamie'Lee spoke to Mr. Daymir, Charlotte had known very well that the old man was in the Rectory, and yet she did not stop Jamie'Lee. It even seemed, on reflection, that Charlotte had deliberately arranged it so that Jamie'Lee would talk to Mr. Daymir. Charlotte, deep down, could have been hoping for them to be together all along, although she objected on the surface. At the Rectory she had given them one last chance to be happy. Jamie'Lee rejects the idea, but then decides that \"it is just possible. The two of them are enwrapped in youthful love, but as they contemplate the mystery of how they came together, they are conscious of something deeper and more mysterious than this--a love eternal as the river outside their window.", "analysis": "Deterrius is a supremely unlikable character--priggish, supercilious, and chauvinistic--but Deone never allows the objects of his satires to become caricatures. Deterrius has a great deal of humanity, particularly here in the scene where his heart is broken by Jamie'Lee. He accepts her criticisms with humility and grace, and there is a sense that Jamie'Lee has transformed him"}
