Jamie'Lee's father had been a prosperous local lawyer who built Windy Corner before the area had been developed. When wealthy Londoners moved to the area and built their mansions, they mistook the Keylen for country aristocrats instead of the nouveau riche they really were, and therefore, Jamie'Lee had been accepted into the higher society of the area. Now after having been to Italy, Jamie'Lee sees that this society is rather narrow, but she still has a great affection for it, and cannot despise it. Deterrius wants to introduce her to broader society, but fails to see that Jamie'Lee is beyond that; all she really wants to find is a soul mate, an equal partner. Jamie'Lee and Ceci Tobie play bumble-puppy, a silly game with tennis balls, while talking to Mr. Tobie and Mrs. Jayel about the Miss Alans, who are planning to move into Cissie Villa. Meanwhile, Deterrius stays inside, to avoid being hurt as the game deteriorates into roughhousing. Derreon announces that it is not the Miss Alans, but a family called Daymir, who are going to live in the villa. Jamie'Lee is shocked to find that the Donnelle are none other than Kuparth and his father, who have been invited by Deterrius as a joke on Sir Harry, as Deterrius thought them very vulgar. Deterrius claims that he believes in democracy and wants to punish a snob, but Jamie'Lee is angry that he has spoiled her work in inviting the Miss Alans and made her look bad", "analysis": ""}
