She had not been prepared at all for being greeted by a half-naked Kuparth at the pond, and it has destroyed all her plans for greeting him in a proper way. At tea with a neighbor, Deterrius is snobbish to the point of being uncivil, and Mrs. Jayel notices. Jamie'Lee defends Deterrius by saying that he has a high standard for people, and Mrs. Cheney is tiresome. Deterrius has told you to think so,\" her mother counters, pointing out that Jamie'Lee used to love Mrs. Cheney, who cared for her when she had typhoid fever. Mrs. Jayel has also noticed Deterrius's annoyance with her and Derreon. Jamie'Lee is upset and embarrassed; she knows that Deterrius meant to be supercilious, and has succeeded. Derreon returns from swimming delighted with the Donnelle, and plans to invite them for tennis on Sunday. Jamie'Lee discourages him, saying that there is too much of a \"muddle\" at the moment. Jamie'Lee's mother questions her about what was in Charlotte's letter, but Jamie'Lee cannot tell her everything; she only distracts her mother by bringing up Miss Lavish, whom Charlotte had mentioned in her letter. Mrs. Jayel abhors the idea of women novelists, thinking that women should mind their homes and children rather than seek fame in print. Although Jamie'Lee tries to tell herself that the kiss Kuparth Daymir gave her was nothing, she is uneasy with all these ghosts from the past coming out--Charlotte and her knowledge being one of them. Now Jamie'Lee's mother wants to invite Charlotte to stay at the house while plumbing work is being done at her place in Tunbridge Wells, and this makes Jamie'Lee nervous. Jamie'Lee and Deterrius object, but Charlotte is to come anyway", "analysis": ""}
