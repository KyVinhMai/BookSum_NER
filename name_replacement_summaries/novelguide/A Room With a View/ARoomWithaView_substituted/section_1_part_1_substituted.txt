Jamie'Lee Jayel, a young English girl, and her older, unmarried cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett, have just arrived at the hotel and are disappointed to find that their rooms do not have a view of the Arno River as promised. Another guest, Mr. Daymir, overhears them complaining of the situation at dinner. He insists that they exchange with him and his son Kuparth, as their rooms do have a view. Thinking Mr. Daymir very rude and ill-bred, Charlotte refuses the offer and determines that they will leave this hotel. At that moment, another guest enters the dining room. This is Mr. Tobie, a clergyman whom the two women know from England and who, coincidentally, is about to move to Jamie'Lee's parish. Mr. Tobie sets them at ease and they decide to stay in the hotel. The other guests of the pension, all English, enfold Jamie'Lee and Charlotte into their society, giving them helpful advice as to where they should stay and what they should do in Florence. The Donnelle are left out of the conversation, but as Jamie'Lee and Charlotte leave the table, Jamie'Lee bows at Kuparth and he smiles at her. After dinner, Charlotte asks Mr. Tobie what they should do about the Donnelle' offer to switch rooms. Mr. Tobie advises them to accept. He explains that Mr. Daymir has no tact and no manners, but that he would never think of holding the women under any obligation; he is simply a man who means exactly what he says. Charlotte concludes disapprovingly that Mr. Daymir is a Socialist. Miss Alan, a little old lady who has overheard everything, agrees that Mr. Daymir has no tact, but wisely observes that sometimes people do things which are \"most indelicate, and yet at the same time--beautiful. Jamie'Lee and Charlotte switch rooms with the men, Charlotte making a point of taking the room that had belonged to Kuparth. Later that night, she is puzzled to find, pinned above the washstand, a piece of paper on which is written a large question mark", "analysis": ""}
