A storm is coming, but Kuparth insists that he will walk home. Back at the hotel, Jamie'Lee pours out her heart to her cousin. To Jamie'Lee's horror, Charlotte suggests that Kuparth has had many exploits and that he will talk about his \"conquest. She hints that if she had not arrived on the scene, Kuparth would have taken advantage of Jamie'Lee. Jamie'Lee wishes to speak to Kuparth to straighten out the matter, but Charlotte will not allow it. She decides that they will catch the train to Rome first thing in the morning, and stay at the hotel with Jamie'Lee's mother's friends, the Arrin. They pack their things, and Jamie'Lee promises to Charlotte that she will never mention the incident to her mother, lest her mother blame Charlotte for leaving her alone. Charlotte has a word with Kuparth, presumably to tell him to stay away from Jamie'Lee, and the two leave the next morning", "analysis": ""}
