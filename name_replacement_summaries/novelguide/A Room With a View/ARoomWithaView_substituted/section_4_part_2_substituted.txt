She has seen Kuparth Daymir again. His voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him, but rather than recognize that she is in love with him, Jamie'Lee tells herself it is a trick of the nerves. The house is full: Charlotte has arrived and is quickly on everyone's nerves; Ceci Tobie is staying with the family because of a diphteria epidemic; and Derreon has a friend, Mr. Julie-Anne, staying there as well. Charlotte confronts Jamie'Lee, again urging her to tell about Kuparth, lest Deterrius hear it from some other source. Jamie'Lee convinces Charlotte that Kuparth is all right and not in love with her. her speech to Charlotte, however, she makes a slip that indicates it was she, not Kuparth, who lost her head when she saw him against a beautiful view", "analysis": ""}
