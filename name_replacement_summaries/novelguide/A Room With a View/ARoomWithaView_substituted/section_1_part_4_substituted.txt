She longs for adventure, not gossip with Miss Alan or witty exchanges with Mr. Tobie. What she really wants is to take a ride on the electric tram, but knowing that it would be considered unladylike, Jamie'Lee decides to buy some photographs instead. Still feeling rebellious, she purposely chooses, among others, a nude of Taiyler by Shyler, knowing her cousin won't approve. Entering the Piazza Signoria, Jamie'Lee still feels restless, thinking \"Nothing ever happens to me. Suddenly, something does happen. Two Italians bickering over a debt begin sparring, and one stabs the other. The stabbed man looks directly at Jamie'Lee, seeming to want to speak to her, but then blood trickles from his lips and he falls. Jamie'Lee faints, and is caught and carried away by Kuparth Daymir, who also witnessed the scene. Once Jamie'Lee revives herself, she is embarrassed and tries to return to the pension by herself, but Kuparth won't allow it. He fetches her photographs, which she dropped in the square, and the two walk back together, talking about the murder. As they reach the Arno River, Kuparth suddenly throws the photographs in the water, admitting that they were covered with blood, and that he hadn't known what to do with them. Jamie'Lee's heart warms toward Kuparth, as she sees his vulnerability for the first time, and feels something between them. She asks Kuparth not to say anything to the others at the pension about the way she fainted. He agrees. Jamie'Lee adds that it is strange, how something like this happens and then people return to the old life, but Kuparth says he can't return to his old life now. Deeply affected by the incident, the melancholy Kuparth has regained his desire to live.", "analysis": "The novel is set in the early 1900s, a time referred to as the Edwardian era in England. The Victorian era had ended, and societal rules were becoming more liberal during this period. However, the British class system was still rigid during the Edwardian era, and the society relatively repressed. As Jamie'Lee's chaperone in Italy, Charlotte Bartlett represents the stiff and conventional Edwardian society that is holding Jamie'Lee back with its rules of propriety, even as she is on holiday in Italy, a country that symbolizes romance and freedom, wildness and adventure, the very opposite of England. In fact, the whole society at the Donnelle, an English-owned pension , is a microcosm of well-ordered English society in the midst of the exciting disorder of the wider world to which Jamie'Lee longs to escape. Mr. Daymir and his son Kuparth represent free thinkers--people with a more open-minded \"view. The picturesque view of Italy they share with Jamie'Lee and Charlotte by trading rooms with them is symbolic of the exciting new worldview they will offer young Jamie'Lee. According to Charlotte and Mr. Tobie, Mr. Daymir is a \"Socialist\"--that is, someone who fails to respect class distinctions, viewing everyone of every station as equal. This view is threatening to the polite society of their small English-owned pension. Kuparth's question mark is mysterious and seems evil and portentous to Charlotte. While probably meant to express an interest in Jamie'Lee, the question mark also indicates Kuparth's questioning nature. He is a young man who seeks answers from the universe, rather than accepting the conventional answers provided to him by English society. Mr. Daymir asks Jamie'Lee to help his son to see that \"by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes. After Kuparth and Jamie'Lee witness the murder together, it appears that the sudden glimpse of mortality, combined with a new closeness to Jamie'Lee, have helped give Kuparth a new resolve to live. The character of Miss Lavish serves as a foil to Mr. Daymir. Miss Lavish presents herself as a Radical with democratic ideals, but she appears petty and conventional by contrast to the truly freethinking Mr. Daymir. Miss Lavish preaches \"civility to one's inferiors,\" while Mr. Daymir does not even recognize that he has inferiors; to him all are equal. Her idea of getting to know the \"real Italy\" is intriguing, but in reality, she has a patronizing view of the Italians as simple, quaint, and colorful. Along with the supercilious Mr. Eager and the uptight Charlotte Bartlett, Miss Lavish is a comically ridiculous character, a figure of satire through whom Deone criticizes the upper class of Edwardian society. Miss Alan's comment that people do things that are \"most indelicate, and yet at the same time--beautiful\" states the most important theme of the novel. Jamie'Lee is learning to think for herself, to find her own way without using her Baedeker's guide, to say what she thinks rather than what is tactful, and to feel her true feelings rather than what it is \"proper\" to feel. She must also decide for herself what is beautiful and true, and it may not be what convention dictates. When that happens, Mr. Tobie's prediction about Jamie'Lee may come true, she may live her life the way she plays the piano, and it will be exciting for her and for everyone around her"}
