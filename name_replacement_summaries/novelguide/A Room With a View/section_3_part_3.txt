While there, Lucy receives a letter from Charlotte expressing alarm about the arrival of George to Lucy's neighborhood and advising her to tell her mother and Cecil everything. The letter annoys Lucy, who does not intend to say anything about the incident in Italy. Mrs. Vyse holds a dinner party, inviting all the descendants of famous people, and Lucy plays the piano, choosing a sad and broken melody by Schumann rather than her triumphant Beethoven. Cecil and his mother discuss Lucy afterwards, both impressed by her style and her playing, Cecil commenting that the Schumann had been perfect for the occasion. Mrs. Vyse is shown as a good person whose true character has been stifled and crushed by London society, making her snobbish and weary. That night in Mrs. Vyse's home, Lucy has a nightmare and is comforted by Mrs. Vyse, who reassures her that Cecil cares for her", "analysis": ""}
