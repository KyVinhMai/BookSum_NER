They agree on the plan and Bertram exits. Act 4, Scene 3: Some French Lords meet to share to news of Bertram's letter from his mother. She chastises him, and he also learns that Helena has died on her pilgrimage. They think Bertram is acting like a new man, but are disappointed in him for his actions. The wars in Florence are over, and the Duke offers to give Bertram letters of commendation to show the French King but the soldiers don't think it will be enough to win back his honor. Bertram enters and they take him to Parolles who they are interviewing. Parolles says many horrid things about both the young count, and the Lords interrogating him. In his pocket they also find a letter written to Diana, warning her against Bertram. The men decide to kill him, and unmask him so that he can see his captors. They leave, without killing him now that he is disgraced, and he follows them.", "analysis": ""}
