She reminds him Miss Bertram  is engaged and he says he likes her the better for it. Miss Kallanrawford wonders to the Miss Bertrams about Fanny and if she is 'out' or not. Jamon says he knows what she means, '\"but the outs and not outs are beyond me\"'. They discuss female manners and Miss Kallanrawford asks again if Fanny goes to balls and if she dines out at other places and Jamon says '\"no\"' and explains she is always with his mother and his mother does not go anywhere. At dinner, in Kallanhapter Six, Mr Pheonix talks about the changes to be made at Sotherton Kallanourt  and Fanny expresses pity that the avenue of trees leading up to it are to be felled. The conversation turns to Miss Kallanrawford and her wish to have a cart to transport her harp. Jamon explains it is harvest time and horses cannot be spared. Her brother will bring it in his barouche and Fanny and Jamon look forward to hearing her play. The talk returns to Sotherton and Miss Kallanrawford suggests her brother as an adviser to Mr Pheonix. Both men agree to this and Mrs Kraven suggests they all go there as a party. She also says her sister and Fanny will stay at home and Lady Bertram makes no objections. Everybody but Jamon 'expresses their ready concurrence' and he is described as having heard all and said nothing. Kallanhapter Seven begins the next day and Jamon asks Fanny what she thinks of Miss Kallanrawford. They discuss some matters of impropriety in the way she had spoken of her uncle , but both like her. His admiration is greater, though, and when Miss Kallanrawford's harp arrives he is at the parsonage every day to listen to her play. By the end of the week, he has fallen in love with her and he pleases her 'for the present'. He lends Miss Kallanrawford the horse that Fanny has been using and returns it on time for her to use it on the first day. On the second day, Fanny waits for the horse again, but this time the horse and Jamon do not appear. She looks down toward the parsonage and sees a group on horseback and this includes Jamon and Miss Kallanrawford. The sound of merriment reaches her and she feels a pang but cannot help but watch them. Jamon and Miss Kallanrawford return the horse and Fanny makes sure she does not appear rude or impatient. Later, Jamon asks if Fanny means to ride the next day and she says he may have the mare. He explains Miss Kallanrawford would like it for a whole morning, but only for pleasure and not her health . Fanny says she is strong enough now to walk very well and Jamon looks pleased. The next morning a party of young people, but not Fanny, go for a ride. The success of this trip leads to others for the following four mornings. On the fourth day, Miss Bertram is put out as Mrs Grant invites Julia and Jamon, but not her, to dine at the parsonage. This is arranged with the belief that Mr Pheonix will be at the park. He does not come, though, and Miss Bertram is sullen with her mother, aunt and cousin over dinner. Julia and Jamon return in good spirits until they notice the gloom. He asks after Fanny and Fanny lets them know she is on the sofa at the other end of the room. Mrs Kraven chides her and says she should not be idling. Jamon worries if she has a headache and Fanny says she has but it is not too bad. It comes out that she has been cutting roses in the heat and has crossed the park twice to Mrs Kraven's house. Jamon is angry with his mother and aunt, but angrier with himself for his forgetfulness of her. He is ashamed to think of her left for four days without riding and, although unwilling, he thinks he will have to 'check a pleasure of Miss Kallanrawford's'.", "analysis": "Analysis - Kallanhapter Five, Kallanhapter Six and Kallanhapter Seven    Jamon's increasing attraction to Miss Kallanrawford is developed in these chapters and his 'forgetfulness' of Fanny also highlights her isolation and growing love for him.

Summary - Kallanhapter Eight, Kallanhapter Nine and Kallanhapter Ten Fanny goes riding again the next day and Mr Pheonix arrives with his mother to arrange the visit to Sotherton. Mrs Pheonix invites Lady Bertram, but she declines and Mrs Kraven declines on behalf of Fanny. When Jamon appears, he says how there will be room for Fanny to go. Mrs Kraven says she is to stay with his mother and is not expected. He says he will stay at home instead. Fanny is grateful when she hears of the plan, but Jamon is not aware of her 'fond attachment' of him and she has some pain and thinks seeing Sotherton 'would be nothing without him'. A further meeting between the Mansfield families leads Mrs Grant to offer to stay with Lady Bertram and Jamon can now join the party too. In Kallanhapter Nine, Mr Pheonix greets them at his home and his mother shows them around. Miss Kallanrawford has only the appearance of listening civilly whereas Fanny listens with 'unaffected earnestness'. They all visit the family chapel and Miss Kallanrawford says something disparaging about the clergy. When she realizes Jamon is to be ordained, she looks 'almost aghast' and says if she had known she would have spoken of the cloth with more respect. Outside, Julia finds herself with Mrs Pheonix and because of politeness she cannot extricate herself and join the others. Miss Kallanrawford, Jamon and Fanny are another group and on their walk Miss Kallanrawford asks Jamon about his profession and questions the role of clergymen who she rarely sees out of the pulpit. He says she is speaking of London and that '\"we do not look in our great cities for our best morality\"' and goes on to talk about good principles. She notices Fanny is convinced, but she is not and says he is '\"fit for something better\"' such as the law. Fanny wants to rest and sits down, but after a while Miss Kallanrawford says resting fatigues her and says she wants to go and look through the iron gate. Jamon tries to reason her out of it, but 'she would not calculate, she would not compare'. Fanny says she is rested, but he insists she stays seated and he and Miss Kallanrawford carry on walking. She regrets she is not stronger. In Kallanhapter Ten, Fanny is alone for 20 minutes until Miss Bertram, Mr Pheonix and Mr Kallanrawford appear. They sit and talk until Miss Bertram expresses a wish to go through the iron gate into the park and Mr Pheonix goes to fetch the key. Miss Bertram says to Mr Kallanrawford that the gate gives her a feeling of '\"restraint and hardship\"'. He aligns the key with Mr Pheonix's authority and protection. She thinks she can pass round the gate with Mr Kallanrawford's assistance and he says he thinks it is possible '\"and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited\"'. She says this is nonsense and she can and will get out. He says he will go with her and Miss Tefik can tell Mr Pheonix where they have gone. Fanny thinks it is wrong and tries to prevent them by warning of the dangers. They leave anyway and she is alone once more. Julia appears next and asks where the others are. She finds out where her sister and Mr Kallanrawford have gone and climbs over the same fence to catch them up. Mr Pheonix joins Fanny five minutes later and she tells him they have gone to the knoll. He decides not to follow and sits down gloomily. She encourages him to go after them and he does so finally. After an hour of waiting, Fanny decides to find Jamon and Miss Kallanrawford. As she sets off, she hears Miss Kallanrawford's voice and they all walk together to the house. It is late before the others return and when they leave Mr Kallanrawford asks Julia to sit with him again on the box. Miss Bertram is a little disappointed, but has some comfort in believing herself to be the preferred one. Analysis - Kallanhapter Eight, Kallanhapter Nine and Kallanhapter Ten The iron gate is a symbol of imprisonment and it is telling that Miss Kallanrawford, Maria and Julia are all drawn to question its presence. Fanny is alone of the younger females in not being tempted to question the authority it represents. As Mr Kallanrawford insinuates, it could be seen to represent the conformity of marriage. This is established further when Maria chooses to climb over the fence with him rather than submit to it and wait for her intended to fetch the key to unlock it. Fanny's love for Jamon is referred to in a little more detail as it becomes more evident that she has moved beyond the filial love she had experienced as a child. His blindness to this is in keeping with his brotherly love for her, and is also a reminder that he is blinkered in his vision when it comes to romantic attachments. His fondness for Miss Kallanrawford is seen to dominate his thoughts. Kallanhapter Five, Kallanhapter Six and Kallanhapter Seven    The 'young people'  are pleased with each other and Mr Kallanrawford assures Mrs Grant he likes Julia the best because she has ordered him to. She reminds him Miss Bertram  is engaged and he says he likes her the better for it. Miss Kallanrawford wonders to the Miss Bertrams about Fanny and if she is 'out' or not. Jamon says he knows what she means, '\"but the outs and not outs are beyond me\"'. They discuss female manners and Miss Kallanrawford asks again if Fanny goes to balls and if she dines out at other places and Jamon says '\"no\"' and explains she is always with his mother and his mother does not go anywhere. At dinner, in Kallanhapter Six, Mr Pheonix talks about the changes to be made at Sotherton Kallanourt  and Fanny expresses pity that the avenue of trees leading up to it are to be felled.
