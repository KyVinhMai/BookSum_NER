He pays Simonov what he had borrowed from him the previous night, and includes in the repayment a letter of apology for his rude behavior. After taking care of this, he lapses back into thoughts of Liza. The UM is genuinely tormented by the idea that she might indeed come to see him, embarrassed by his poverty and indecency. He does, however, still like to imagine himself as her savior, pretending that she loves him and owes everything to him. Lastly, the UM describes his hatred for Apollon, his old servant to whom he owes wages. He can't stand it when Apollon stares at him out of spite, but more importantly, he can't stand the fact that Apollon won't yield to him, or let himself be dominated", "analysis": ""}
