Indeed the whole tone of the notes has shifted dramatically, becoming much more catastrophic and heartbreaking. He begins detailing what it will be like when she dies, on old, wretched woman not loved by anyone. He tells her, \"That'll be the end of your memory on earth; for other women, children will visit their graves, fathers, husbands-but for you-no tears, no sighs; no remembrances. Over the course of the whole conversation, the UM maintains a very pompous, superior tone over this woman. As in his \"beautiful and sublime\" dreams, he has become the hero before her, the one with all the answers. Unfortunately, if she ever comes to visit him , she will realize that in reality, he is nothing more than a spec of dirt. This haunts the UM to no end", "analysis": ""}
