Conscious inertia is better. And so, long live the underground. Yet quickly he admits that he's lying, that he doesn't truly prefer the underground, but \"something different, altogether different, something that I long for, but I'll never be able to find. He also says that he doesn't believe a word that he has just said, which makes the reader wonder about the man's sanity.
