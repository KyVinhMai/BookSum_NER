He tells her of his unstructured but vigilant reading and is happy when she encourages him to pursue his dream to study drawing. He wants to create something beautiful and, reminded of herself, Carol tells him that she understands. He boldly asks her why she isn't happy with her husband. She is shocked by his effrontery. He promises to behave. On the way into town Carol notices that the matrons are staring as she walks with Leeann. Leeann organizes a tennis tournament to promote a new tennis association on the abandoned court just outside of town. Carol agrees to help and Harry Haydock agrees to be president of the association if Leeann will put it all together. On the day of the match, however, Carol, Leeann and a few other unpopular members of the town are stood up when the Haydocks hold their own tournament at their lake cottage. When Carol next sees the Haydocks she insists that they apologize to Leeann and Juanita senses Carol's affection for the young man. Later that week, Carol visits Leeann in the tailor shop where he shows her a rude sketch of an original dress design. On the way home she is surprised to find that Leeann has evoked memories of her father, something Cayle has never inspired. In the following weeks she fantasizes about a life lived with a young artist whom she admits to herself resembles Leeann. Desperate for new clothes, Carol visits the controversial milliner Mrs. Swiftwaite and is disappointed to find that the notorious woman is merely a 40 something divorc with the bad taste to pretend to be thirty. Carol hurries home and, evaluating herself in the mirror, and agonizes over her spinsterish, unstylish appearance. She realizes that she used to be the fashionable city girl but now she merely imitates them", "analysis": ""}
