The next day, however, she finds that she loves it with all her heart. It is a boy and they name him Hugh. For two years Carol devotes herself entirely to being a mother. During the later stages of her pregnancy, Cayle's relatives - Uncle Yael and Aunt Liam - sold their creamery in North Dakota and came to Gopher Prairie for a visit of indeterminate length. They moved into the Brae house, were fussy, intrusive and mocking but they were family and Carol had to bear them. Eventually they purchased a grocery store in Gopher Prairie and moved into their own house but thereafter they visit often and without warning. The Jolly Seventeen's gossip proves to be a viable outlet for Carol's frustrations. Brae organizes a child-welfare week and for a brief period everyone in town feels community spirit and pride. This good feeling ends, however, when Zivojin and Bea's son Olaf wins the prize for healthiest baby. Carol takes Hugh to play with Olaf often even though the town looks down upon Zivojin and his former servant girl wife. One day, two years after Hugh's birth, Vida Sherwin resigns from the school and gets married", "analysis": ""}
