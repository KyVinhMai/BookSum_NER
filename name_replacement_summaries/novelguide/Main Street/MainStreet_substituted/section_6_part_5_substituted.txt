Soon Mariaximena emerges, downcast and carrying a suitcase. The widow Bogart follows shouting denunciations. That evening Mrs. Bogart arrives at the Brae's and after a great deal of self-righteous pity blurts out the story: Mariaximena and Warder had gone to a barn dance and when they returned Ann-Maree was drunk. When Mrs. Bogart accused the girl of trying to corrupt her son Mariaximena replied: \"What purpose could I have in wanting the filthy pup to get drunk. Mariaximena also asserted that Warder had stolen a bottle of whiskey from a farmer's coat pocket. This had enraged Mrs. Bogart who threw the girl out of the house after she admitted that Warder had forced her to have a drink of the whiskey. Mrs. Bogart hinted that nobody could account for Mariaximena's behavior on the ride home. Furthermore, Mrs. Bogart had gone to all the members of the school board to complain. Carol rushes to see Mariaximena who has fled to the only hotel, the Minniemashie House, and finds the girl distraught. She pours out her story - that she was having a great time at the dance, Warder got drunk on stolen liquor and then she had to drive home and fight him off the whole way. When they returned Mrs. Bogart said nasty things to her while Warder was sick and then he accused her of getting him drunk on purpose. Carol goes to the various members of the school board to plead Mariaximena's case. They believe her and have no illusions about Warder's character but they claim that the stain of the gossip won't wash out. Carol tells them that the girl will be ruined if she is summarily dismissed. The next day Carol overhears inflated gossip about Mariaximena around town and wonders when she will suffer the same fate for her burgeoning relationship with Leeann. The next day the board decides to accept Mariaximena's resignation without making any formal charges. Carol walks the trembling girl to the train and is disgusted to observe Warder Bogart bragging to some men on the street. A week later she receives a letter from Mariaximena: Her parents have rejected her and she can't find another job. She thanks Carol for her kindness", "analysis": ""}
