Carol is jealous when she observes Maud Dyer flirting with Leeann. When Leeann asks Carol to go for a boat ride she accepts to spite Maude. Leeann professes his affection for her; she doesn't yield to his advances nor does she resist. They return very late to the rest of the group. The next day Mrs. Bogart arrives and second-handedly questions Carol about Leeann and Carol knows that the nosy woman's suspicions have been aroused. At a church dinner the following week Carol is relieved to see that Maud Dyer talks to Cayle instead of Leeann and then she is discomfited to see Mrs. Bogart watching her watch Leeann. Carol begins to confuse wanting youth with wanting Leeann. She reasons that Main Street's dullness has driven her to desire an escape. Leeann tells her that Myrtle Cass' father has offered him a position at the flour mill. Carol asserts that Myrtle Cass is trying to snare him. Leeann claims to be interested in Carol, not Myrtle Cass. Carol begins to doubt her marriage", "analysis": ""}
