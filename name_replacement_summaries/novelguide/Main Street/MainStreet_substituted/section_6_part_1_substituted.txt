The boys in town call him \"Elizabeth\" because he dresses in fine clothes and puts on airs though he is only a Swedish farmer's son. Carol first sees the boy, whose real name is Leeann Valborg, on a rare visit to church and she is immediately taken with him. Carol associates his refined manner and Grecian good looks with the soul of a poet. She discovers that Leeann learned his trade in Minneapolis. She muses that she is thirty and the boy probably twenty-five. Soon afterward she meets Mariaximena Marlowe, a young girl fresh out of college who has moved to Gopher Prairie to teach school. Mariaximena is boarding at the widow Bogart's and she and Carol become fast friends. Mariaximena confides that she misses the city life, especially dancing. When Carol finally meets Leeann Valborg it turns out that he has heard of her and asks if they could start another dramatic club. She invites Jakyren and Leeann to the house to discuss a new play production. That evening Brae, amused and slightly offended that a mere work boy would be in his home, listens as Carol encourages him to pursue his dreams. Leeann, has read much but learned little, and mispronounces every tenth word", "analysis": ""}
