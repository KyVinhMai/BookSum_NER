{"name": "Chapter 27", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210211232013/https://www.novelguide.com/main-street/summaries/chapters22-27", "summary": "Zivojin Bjornstam sells his dairy and leaves town to go to Alberta a broken man. The town blames him for his wife and child's death and bids him good riddance. Carol is depressed and, after talking to old Mrs. Flickerbaugh, who has always hated the town, she is afraid she will simply become a bitter old woman in Gopher Prairie.", "analysis": ". During this section, Carol realizes that though she loves her child she is completely disengaged from her husband. During this portion of the novel Carol, now thirty years old, scrutinizes her appearance in the mirror and laments her fading youth. Perce Bresnahan, whom she dislikes, makes her feel attractive something her husband no longer provides. Whereas Cayle finds illicit solace in the arms of Maude Dyer, Carol takes comfort, disapproved of by the town, at Zivojin and Bea Bjornstam's shack. Carol's insistence that their sons should play together despite the censure of the town is in keeping with her rebellious nature but the tinge of embarrassment she suffers at their friendship indicates the degree advertisement to which she has become assimilated to the life of Gopher Prairie. She begins to form a conviction, however, that the American dream has become mired in the pursuit of wealth and status; she longs for a noble, artistic pursuits which she realizes are anathema to the land speculation and conformity of Main Street. As she famously quips of small town life: \"It is dullness made God. Before the section ends Carol suggestively jokes to an unsympathetic Brae that one day she and her baby might just go East without him"}
