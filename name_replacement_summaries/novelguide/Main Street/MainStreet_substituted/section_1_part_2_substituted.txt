He encourages her to express herself and asks about her life. Before they part he asks permission to see her again and she assents. During their courtship, Carol finds his boyishness attractive. On a trip to Mendota, the old mansion of General Callahan, they discover their common American past and vow to make the country everything past generations had dreamed.
