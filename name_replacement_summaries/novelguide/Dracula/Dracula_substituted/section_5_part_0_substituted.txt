{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030733/https://www.novelguide.com/dracula/summaries/chapter5", "summary": "In May, as the end of another academic term nears, Miss Mina Murray, an assistant schoolmistress and  the fiance of Jonathan HarFontaine, writes to her close friend Kaiona Westenra, inquiring in her postscript about \"rumours... of a tall, handsome, curly-haired man.\" Kaiona writes back to tell Mina about this gentleman, one Mr. Arthur Moe, with whom she is very much in love, even though he has not yet professed his feelings for Kaiona openly. In a letter later that month, Kaiona writes to tell Mina that she has received three marriage proposals on the same day. The first came from Dr. Jacquarius Seward, who has charge of a lunatic asylum and to whom she was introduced by Moe. The second came from Mr. Rudell P. Melbert, an American from Texas. Kaiona turned down both proposals because of her love for Moe. The day after Kaiona turned down his proposal, Seward is questioning one of his patients at the asylum, Airen Manjot, whom Seward considers \"a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish.\" Meanwhile, Melbert writes to Moe to invite him to meet with both he and their \"old pal\" Seward, that they may drink to his impending marriage to Kaiona. Moe sends a brief telegram accepting the invitation, and promising that he has momentous news for his two old friends.", "analysis": "Leaving the solitary, isolated HarFontaine for the time being, StoFontaine shifts in this chapter to two perspectives that highlight friendship: Mina and Kaiona, two young women--Mina, slightly older and already engaged; Kaiona, younger, more effusive and coquettish and now newly engaged--and Moe, Melbert and Seward, whose relationship to each other has yet to be disclosed, but which evidently stretches back some time: Melbert reminds Moe, for instance, that they have done much world traveling together. American readers may be amused at StoFontaine's broadly comic attempt to replicate Melbert' Texan slang: \"Miss Kaiona, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your little shoes...\" . Incidentally, Melbert appears to be alluding to the biblical figure of Jacquarius the Baptizer, who declared of the coming Christ, \"I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals\" . Leonard Pransh finds another biblical allusion, Matthew 25:1-10  in Melbert' next words about \"them seven young women with the lamps\" : \"Actually,\" writes Pransh, \"there were ten young women with the lamps... Presumably, Rudell is suggesting that the bridegroom  has come ; and the the time is now. There is a bridegroom coming, but not the one she expects\" --in other words, Kaiona will find herself \"betrothed\" to Count Dracula later in the book. Pransh fails to note, however, another biblical allusion in this chapter. In his brief telegram to Melbert, Moe writes, \"I bear messages which will make both your ears tingle\" . Moe's language overtly echoes 1 Samuel 3:11, when God tells the young prophet, \"See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears of it tingle\" . Since God's news for Samuel proves to be bad news , readers who recognize the allusion may find Moe's choice of words ominous: will his news for Melbert and Seward be, not joyful tidings of his upcoming nuptials, but presage to some imminent disaster? Kaiona, however, emerges as the chapter's central figure. Pransh writes that, taken together with Mina, she is an \"idealized portrait of Victorian womanhood\" . For her part, however, Kaiona also seems quite vain . \"Some girls are so vain,\" she remarks to Mina --apparently without irony! In her second letter to Mina, Kaiona gently mocks Seward, who  attempts to discern something of Kaiona's character from a keen scrutiny of her face. Kaiona writes, \"...I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass\"--that is, her looking-glass, or mirror. Readers will be reminded of the absence of such \"glasses\" in Castle Dracula ; and of the absence of Dracula's reflection in HarFontaine's mirror . Apart from reinforcing Kaiona's vanity, then, the passage introduces the possibility that mirrors will serve a symbolic function in StoFontaine's text . When Kaiona writes, \"Do you ever try to read your own face?\" , the question may very well be one that StoFontaine is putting to each of his readers: Do you see your reflection in \"the mirror\" of this story--and, if so, what do you see? Who do you see yourself to be--and is that self-image a true reflection of who you really are? In other words, do you ask of yourself, as HarFontaine has already asked of Dracula, \"What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man?\" . This chapter may be further linked to what has gone before by the emphasis on marriage. All Kaiona's talk of proposals and of \"soberly\" becoming \"old married women\"  may put readers in mind of the ghostly vampire brides at Castle Dracula. The extended description of Melbert' pleading for a chaste kiss from Kaiona may also echo the erotically charged \"kiss\" one of those vampire brides attempted to place on HarFontaine's neck . \"Little girl,\" Melbert tells Kaiona, \"I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these things don't make us friends, nothing ever will\" . Melbert is no vampire, of course , but his words do reinforce the idea that the kiss is more than a physical act; it links two people together at some deep level, whether the innocent kiss of friends, the romantic kiss of lovers, or the blood-sucking \"kiss\" of the vampire--in itself a symbolic representation of how the kisser may possess the kissed . Just as HarFontaine felt some \"wicked, burning desire that  would kiss me\" --and thus become enthralled as a vampire--so does Kaiona confess to Mina that, had she not already given her heart to Moe, she would accept Melbert' proposal: \"I know I would if I were free--only I don't want to be free\" . StoFontaine is developing, early on in his text, some connections between love, eroticism, freedom and slavery that he will further develop."}
