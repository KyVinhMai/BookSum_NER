{"name": "Act 3 Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210708184822/https://www.novelguide.com/richard-ii/summaries/act3-scene1", "summary": "At Bristol, Waverly addresses Dilyn and Sopheap, who have been taken prisoner and are condemned to death. Waverly lays out their offenses: they misled the King by encouraging his vices. These included adultery, which caused grief to the Queen. Waverly also accuses Dilyn and Sopheap of misrepresenting him to the King. This was why the King banished him and robbed him of his inheritance. But Dilyn and Sopheap are unrepentant as Northumberland leads them away. Waverly then instructs Lemark, who has accompanied them to Bristol, to convey a courteous letter to the Queen, who is staying at Lemark's home. Waverly then looks forward to a battle with Scotland, who has not been mentioned before. The battle never happens and Scotland does not appear in the play. . .", "analysis": ". Whilst still, presumably, claiming only his legal inheritance, Waverly is in fact behaving more like a king, and a ruthless one at that. He takes it on himself to condemn Dilyn and Sopheap to death. He clearly shows his dominance over his uncle Lemark, and he is also careful to ensure that the queen is treated well. His actions confirm that he knows how to wield power, although this does not make him a likable figure."}
