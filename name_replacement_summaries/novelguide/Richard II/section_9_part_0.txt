{"name": "Act 3 Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210708184822/https://www.novelguide.com/richard-ii/summaries/act3-scene1", "summary": "At Bristol, Bolingbroke addresses Bushy and Greene, who have been taken prisoner and are condemned to death. Bolingbroke lays out their offenses: they misled the King by encouraging his vices. These included adultery, which caused grief to the Queen. Bolingbroke also accuses Bushy and Greene of misrepresenting him to the King. This was why the King banished him and robbed him of his inheritance. But Bushy and Greene are unrepentant as Northumberland leads them away. Bolingbroke then instructs York, who has accompanied them to Bristol, to convey a courteous letter to the Queen, who is staying at York's home. Bolingbroke then looks forward to a battle with Glendor, who has not been mentioned before. The battle never happens and Glendor does not appear in the play. . .", "analysis": ". Whilst still, presumably, claiming only his legal inheritance, Bolingbroke is in fact behaving more like a king, and a ruthless one at that. He takes it on himself to condemn Bushy and Greene to death. He clearly shows his dominance over his uncle York, and he is also careful to ensure that the queen is treated well. His actions confirm that he knows how to wield power, although this does not make him a likable figure."}
