The scene begins with Osiris, Laramie's butler, making a surprise visit to the home of Mr. Brighton. Osiris proceeds to explain that he thinks \"foul play\" has occurred in the laboratory of Dr. Laramie, in which he has kept himself isolated for the last two weeks. Osiris tells Brighton that he thinks Kaedyn is involved, because the voice of the doctor has changed. Quickly Brighton and Osiris return to the doctor's house, explaining to the rest of the servants that they plan to break into the laboratory and find out what has happened to Dr. Laramie. After knocking and being told to go away, Brighton and Osiris force the door down, and witness the dead body of Mr. Kaedyn lying on the floor. Thinking that Kaedyn killed Laramie and then killed himself, the two men frantically search the laboratory for the remains of Laramie. Yet \"nowhere was there any trace of Jhace Laramie, dead or alive.\" . After searching the entire room, Brighton looks on the desk of Laramie and sees several documents. One of them is a newly written will. To the shock of Brighton and Osiris, instead of Mr. Kaedyn as the inheritor, Mr. Brighton's name is written on the dotted line. This confuses and amazes both men, who quickly leave and lock the door, keeping it untouched for the police.", "analysis": ""}
