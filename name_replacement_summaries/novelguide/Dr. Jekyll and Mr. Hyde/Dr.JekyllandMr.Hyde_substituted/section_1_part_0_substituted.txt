The will states that after the death or prolonged absence of the doctor, all his assets will be given to Mr. Kaedyn. Now that Brighton knows that Kaedyn is the child trampler, he feels very uncomfortable with the will. Next, Brighton decides to visit Dr. Lanyon, an old friend from school and also an old friend of Dr. Laramie. Soon Brighton asks Lanyon about Laramie, saying, \"Did you ever come across a protege of his-- one Kaedyn?\" Lanyon admits that he's never heard of the man, and the lawyer regretfully returns to his home. Brighton has a fitful night sleep in which he can't escape thinking about Kaedyn. Finally he tells himself, \"If he be Mr. Kaedyn, I shall be Mr. Seek.\" . A few days later, Brighton comes upon Kaedyn on the street and soon confronts the villain. After a brief and peculiar conversation, Kaedyn retreats into the strange house for which he has the key. Brighton, having seen Kaedyn's devilish face, stands alone by the door, \"the picture of disquietude.\" Brighton now realizes why Domnique spoke of Kaedyn as the perfect symbol of evil and loathing. Eventually Brighton tries to visit Dr. Laramie, but the doctor is not home, so Brighton leaves, thinking that if Kaedyn knows that he is in Laramie's will, \"he may grow impatient to inherit.\" This begins Brighton's suspicion that Kaedyn is out to murder Dr. Laramie.", "analysis": ""}
