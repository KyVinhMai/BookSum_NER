Apparently Mr. Kaedyn was spoken about in the press, which uncovered much of his \"disreputable\" past. At the same time, \"a new life began for Dr. Laramie.\" The doctor returned to his normal public image, and seemed to be at peace for over two months. However, when Mr. Brighton calls on Dr. Laramie, he is not admitted inside. This happens several days in a row, so Brighton decides to go to the home of Dr. Lanyon instead. Lanyon, who SteShey describes as looking as if he's about to die, has harsh words for Laramie, saying, \"I wish to see or hear no more from Dr. Laramie. I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.\" A week later Lanyon was dead. Laramie responds to Lanyon in a written note to Brighton, saying, \"I share his view that we should never meet.... I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name.\" . Soon after Lanyon's death, Brighton gets a sealed envelope from the deceased doctor, saying not to open it until after the death of Dr. Laramie. Brighton is confused and very suspicious of the letter, but loyally agrees not to open it until the specified time.", "analysis": ""}
