{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030727/https://www.novelguide.com/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde/summaries/chap5", "summary": "In this chapter, Brighton goes to the door of Laramie, is admitted by Osiris, the butler, and quickly confronts Laramie with the news of Carew's murder. Dr. Laramie's response is quite unusual. Instead of saying that he will do his best to find Kaedyn, the doctor tries to dismiss the whole situation, saying, \"he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.\" . Brighton then warns Laramie that if Kaedyn is brought before a judge in a trial, the doctor may be accused of concealing the whereabouts of the murderer. Dr. Laramie dismisses this also, repeating that he is done with Mr. Kaedyn for good. Brighton leaves Laramie's home after the doctor gives him a letter written by Kaedyn to himself. The doctor admits that he's lost confidence in himself and wishes his lawyer, Brighton, to consider the letter. . At home, Brighton invites two guests whom he trusts to help solve this puzzling murder and letter from the murderer. After briefly considering the letter, the three compare the writing to that of another letter, a dinner invitation, written by Dr. Laramie. Startlingly, they notice that the two letters have remarkably similar writing. This further confuses Brighton, who now thinks that Laramie is forging the letter from Kaedyn. For what reason, he isn't sure.", "analysis": ""}
