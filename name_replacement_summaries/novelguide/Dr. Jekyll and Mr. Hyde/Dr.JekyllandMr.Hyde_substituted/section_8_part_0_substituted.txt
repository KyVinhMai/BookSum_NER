The first is a letter in a letter. In Lanyon's narrative, he encloses a copy of the letter written him by Laramie, giving him a series of strange instructions. Dr. Laramie's desperate message urges Lanyon to go to his laboratory and retrieve his drawer full of medicine bottles. He is to force the lock open, with the help of a locksmith which Osiris will arrange for. Next Lanyon is to return to his own home and at midnight, open the door to a short man , who will take the drawer. Lanyon, though now thinking that Laramie has gone insane, does exactly as told and is soon met by Kaedyn , who comes to the door and asks for the medicine drawer. Soon Kaedyn enters Lanyon's home, seizes a specific bottle from the drawer and proceeds to drink it in one gulp. What follows flabbergasts Lanyon and probably leads to his death. Instantly, Mr. Kaedyn, after drinking the mixture, is transformed into the body of Dr. Laramie.", "analysis": ""}
