{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030727/https://www.novelguide.com/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde/summaries/chap5", "summary": "In this chapter, Utterson goes to the door of Jekyll, is admitted by Poole, the butler, and quickly confronts Jekyll with the news of Carew's murder. Dr. Jekyll's response is quite unusual. Instead of saying that he will do his best to find Hyde, the doctor tries to dismiss the whole situation, saying, \"he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.\" . Utterson then warns Jekyll that if Hyde is brought before a judge in a trial, the doctor may be accused of concealing the whereabouts of the murderer. Dr. Jekyll dismisses this also, repeating that he is done with Mr. Hyde for good. Utterson leaves Jekyll's home after the doctor gives him a letter written by Hyde to himself. The doctor admits that he's lost confidence in himself and wishes his lawyer, Utterson, to consider the letter. . At home, Utterson invites two guests whom he trusts to help solve this puzzling murder and letter from the murderer. After briefly considering the letter, the three compare the writing to that of another letter, a dinner invitation, written by Dr. Jekyll. Startlingly, they notice that the two letters have remarkably similar writing. This further confuses Utterson, who now thinks that Jekyll is forging the letter from Hyde. For what reason, he isn't sure.", "analysis": ""}
