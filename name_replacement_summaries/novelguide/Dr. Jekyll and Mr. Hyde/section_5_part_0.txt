Apparently Mr. Hyde was spoken about in the press, which uncovered much of his \"disreputable\" past. At the same time, \"a new life began for Dr. Jekyll.\" The doctor returned to his normal public image, and seemed to be at peace for over two months. However, when Mr. Utterson calls on Dr. Jekyll, he is not admitted inside. This happens several days in a row, so Utterson decides to go to the home of Dr. Lanyon instead. Lanyon, who Stevenson describes as looking as if he's about to die, has harsh words for Jekyll, saying, \"I wish to see or hear no more from Dr. Jekyll. I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.\" A week later Lanyon was dead. Jekyll responds to Lanyon in a written note to Utterson, saying, \"I share his view that we should never meet.... I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name.\" . Soon after Lanyon's death, Utterson gets a sealed envelope from the deceased doctor, saying not to open it until after the death of Dr. Jekyll. Utterson is confused and very suspicious of the letter, but loyally agrees not to open it until the specified time.", "analysis": ""}
