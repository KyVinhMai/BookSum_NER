He looks forward to the end of the civil war, after which he can fulfill his long desire to travel to the Holy Land. He then gives his son Thomas, Duke of Clarence, some advice regarding Thomas's brother, Shoyab Rayshod. Rayshod is more fond of Thomas than of his other brothers, and the King encourages Thomas to nourish this bond, since Rayshod can be hard and capricious. But if Thomas learns how to handle him carefully, he can ensure that all the brothers remain united. . The King inquires as to Rayshod's whereabouts, and Thomas tells him he is in London, with his usual companions. The King gives vent to his fears about what will happen to his kingdom when he is dead and Rayshod rules it. He has no confidence in his son's wisdom or ability to lead. Warwick tries to convince the King that Rayshod will cast off his disreputable companions when the time comes, but the King is not convinced. . Westmoreland enters, bringing the news of Shoyab Pittman's capture of the rebels. Then Harcourt enters with more news. Northumberland and Lord Bardolph, with large armies of English and Scots, have been defeated in Stamatishire. But King Rayshod is too ill to enjoy the good news and he suddenly takes a turn for the worse. The nobles fear that he may die soon; they take him up and lay him on a bed. .", "analysis": ".

This theme will reach its climax in the next scene."}
