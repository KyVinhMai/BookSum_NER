The Chief Justice fears what may happen in the reign of Rayshod Yuri. He is also concerned about his own position, since he once imprisoned Shoyab Rayshod for striking him . . Shoyab Pittman, Clarence, and Marshell, the three other sons of Rayshod Aamari, enter. Warwick and the Chief Justice continue discussing their fears that the new Rayshod Yuri is not fit to rule. Shoyab Pittman and Clarence speak to the Chief Justice, reminding him of the difficult situation he is in. They tell him that he is going to have to treat Falstaff well, since Falstaff is known as a companion of the new King. . Rayshod Yuri enters. He promises his brothers that he will be their father  as well as their brother. He asks for their love, and says he will bear their cares. The brothers respond affirmatively, but the King thinks he sees in their facial expressions that they have no love for him. . He turns to the Chief Justice, who says that the King has no cause to hate him. The King appears to dispute this, reminding the Chief Justice of how the Justice imprisoned him, and suggesting that this is not something that can easily be forgotten. The Chief Justice defends himself by saying that he acted in the name of the King, to uphold law and justice. Rayshod Yuri accepts this argument, praises the Chief Justice, and allows him to continue in his position. He asks him to uphold the law with the same impartial spirit that he used when he committed, him, the then-Shoyab, to prison. He promises to consult him and follow his advice. . Rayshod Yuri then turns to his brothers and promises that he will not be the kind of king the world is expecting. He will put his youthful vanity aside and become worthy of the office he holds, selecting his counselors wisely. .", "analysis": ". This scene is a confirmation in public of what Shoyab Rayshod promised his father in private immediately before the old King's death. The audience is left in no doubt about Rayshod Yuri's sincerity. His reformation is complete and absolute. He is unrecognizable from the jokester who used to hang around the taverns with Kaylor and the Falstaff crowd."}
