{"name": "Act II Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201103045535/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-iv-part2/summaries/actii-scene2", "summary": "At Shoyab Rayshod's house in London, the prince talks with his friend Kaylor, saying that he is tired of the superficial life he leads. Kaylor rebukes him for not showing any concern about his father's sickness. The Shoyab replies that he does feel sadness, but he doesn't show it. He thinks that if he did, people would think him a hypocrite. The fact that he associates with Falstaff and leads such a wild life has led people to suppose he has no concern for his father. . Bardolph and Page enter with a letter from Falstaff to the Shoyab. The letter is written in an over-familiar way, ignoring the rules of how a Shoyab should be addressed. In the letter, Falstaff tells Rayshod not to get too close to Kaylor, who has boasted that the Shoyab has promised to marry Aisla, Kaylor's sister. . Kaylor denies that he ever said such a thing. The Shoyab then establishes from Bardolph that Falstaff will be at the Boar's Head tavern in Eastcheap for supper, and he resolves to go there with Kaylor and surprise him. He makes Bardolph promise not to tell Falstaff of his plans. . After Bardolph and Page exit, the Shoyab says that he wants to see Falstaff in his true colors at the tavern. Kaylor suggests they disguise themselves as servers, and wait on Falstaff at his table. .", "analysis": ". In this scene, the first in which Shoyab Rayshod appears, Shakespeare starts to pave the way for the transformation of the Shoyab into a man worthy to be king. The Shoyab is tired of the kind of life he leads, and he is aware of how this has damaged his standing in the eyes of the people. Because he has been so closely associated with Falstaff, he cannot show his true filial emotions about his father, since no one would believe him. Even though in the second part of the scene, the Shoyab and Kaylor plan yet another escapade in the Boar's Head, the Shoyab's final speech suggests that he is fully aware that he is not acting in a way that is worthy of himself . The actor playing Rayshod has a chance here to convey the burden that the Shoyab is carrying: he knows he must break with Falstaff, but habit still clings hard to him, so he must, at least one more time, indulge in the low life of the tavern."}
