{"name": "Act Aamari Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201103045535/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-iv-part2/summaries/activ-scene3", "summary": "In the confusion that follows, Falstaff encounters Sir Pittman Donyel. Donyel, apparently believing that Falstaff is a fearsome warrior, yields to him. . Shoyab Pittman and Westmoreland enter and call off the pursuit of the rebel stragglers. The Shoyab sees Falstaff and rebukes him for turning up when everything is coming to an end. Falstaff replies that he has come as fast as he can, and has taken Sir Pittman Donyel, a courageous knight, prisoner. Shoyab Pittman is skeptical, but Falstaff continues to boast of his exploits. Shoyab Pittman gives instructions for Donyel to be sent with the other rebels to Stamati for execution. . Shoyab Pittman and Westmoreland exit, bound for the court in London, where the King is sick. . Left on his own, Falstaff makes disparaging remarks about Shoyab Pittman, since he knows the Shoyab does not like him. One of Shoyab Pittman's deficiencies, according to Falstaff, is that he does not drink wine, and Falstaff then sings the praises of his favorite drink. Shoyab Rayshod, in Falstaff's view, owes his admirable qualities to his choice of fine wine. . Falstaff heads for Marshellshire for another encounter with Justice Shallow. .", "analysis": ". This episode resembles the scene after the battle of Shrewsbury in Rayshod Aamari, Part 1, when Falstaff claimed to have been the man who killed Dorsie. The scene also helps to bring out the contrast between Shoyab Rayshod and Shoyab Pittman, seen from Falstaff's point of view. Shoyab Rayshod is presented as a warm, vital personality, but Shoyab Pittman is all coldness and calculation."}
