The character appears, according to the stage directions, \"painted full of tongues.\" . King Henry IV: King Henry IV is a man weighed down by the burdens of kingship. Although he personally fought in the battle of Shrewsbury, he takes no direct part in the fight against the rebels led by the Archbishop, delegating that responsibility to Prince John. The King is distressed that his reign has seen so many civil wars, which have thwarted his desire to journey to the Holy Land. But he knows this has happened because he seized the crown from Richard II rather than inherited it rightfully. Henry IV is also a sick man who knows that he does not have long to live. He is worried about his son Prince Henry, whom he believes is not worthy of inheriting the crown because of his irresponsible behavior. He fears for what will happen to England after his death. However, just before his death, Henry IV is reconciled to his son, who promises to rule the kingdom wisely. . Prince Henry: Prince Henry, , is the eldest son of Henry IV and the heir to the throne. Although he performed valiantly at the battle of Shrewsbury, killing the rebel leader, Hotspur, he still has a reputation for leading a wild, irresponsible life, hanging around with thieves and drunkards, including Sir John Falstaff, at the Boar's Head tavern in Eastcheap, London. But he spends less and less time with Falstaff, and he promises his father, on his deathbed, that he will reform his life and do justice to the kingship he is about to inherit. When the King dies and Prince Henry is crowned Henry V, he surprises his brothers by promising to rule wisely and well. He makes his peace with the Lord Chief Justice and publicly rejects his former companions, especially Falstaff, whom he banishes from his presence. . Prince John of Lancaster: Prince John of Lancaster, the third son of Henry IV, is put in charge of the campaign against the rebels. He is a cold, calculating man. Falstaff does not like him because he never laughs, and Falstaff attributes that to the fact that he does not drink. Prince John employs a Machiavellian political strategy to defeat the rebels. He offers them peace terms and promises to keep his word, but after the rebels have disbanded their army, he orders the arrest of the rebel leaders. . Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester: Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester is the youngest of Henry's IV's four sons. He plays only a small role in the events of the play. .

He is persuaded by his advisors to go ahead with battle plans, even though Northumberland's forces will be absent. When challenged by Westmoreland, he defends the righteousness of his cause. But the Archbishop is tricked by Prince John's offer of peace in Gaultree Forest, and along with the other rebel leaders he is executed. . Lord Mowbray: Lord Mowbray is one of the rebel leaders. His motivation for joining the rebellion may be personal, since he repeatedly alludes to the fact that his father was banished for life by Richard II following a dispute with Bolingbroke . Mowbray is arrested, along with the other leaders, at Gaultree Forest, and sent to execution. . Lord Hastings: Lord Hastings is one of the rebel leaders. At a meeting of the rebels at the Archbishop of York's palace, his advice is to proceed to battle, since he believes the rebels have sufficient forces to prevail, even without Northumberland. He trusts Prince John to keep his word in the negotiations at Gaultree Forests, and disbands his army. But then Westmoreland arrests him, and he is sent for execution. . Lord Bardolph: Lord Bardolph is one of the rebel leaders, an associate of Northumberland. Bardolph is cautious, and advises the Archbishop and Hastings to wait until Northumberland's forces arrive before committing themselves to battle.

Earl of Westmoreland: The Earl of Westmoreland is one of the commanders of the King's army. He meets with the rebels in Gaultree Forest, where he reproaches the Archbishop of York for his part in the rebellion, but announces that Prince John is prepared to hear their grievances and grant redress if their complaints are justified.

He brings news of the King's troop movements to the crowd at the Boar's Head. . Harcourt: Harcourt is one of the King's men. He brings news of the defeat of Northumberland and the Scots. . The Lord Chief Justice: The Lord Chief Justice is Falstaff's chief antagonist, and he orders Falstaff to pay Hostess Quickly what he owes her.

His good nature makes others willing to forgive his outrageous and unscrupulous behavior, and he gets out of scrapes by using his wit and his ability to play on words. Falstaff also appears in Henry IV, Part 1, where he takes the credit for killing Hotspur in battle . In Henry IV Part 2, Falstaff continues to be an amusing character, although his conduct is even more outrageous than in the earlier play. He exploits Mistress Quickly's generosity and affection for him by refusing to pay his debts and then getting even more money out of her when she is almost bankrupt; he allows recruits to bribe their way out of military service; he despises Shallow, the country justice, and borrows a thousand pounds from him, which he does not repay; he captures Sir John Coleville in battle only because Coleville gives up without a fight .

Shallow is flattered by Falstaff's visits and is foolish enough to lend the knight some money, which Falstaff does not return. . Silence: Silence, like Shallow, is a country Justice of the Peace. As his name implies, he says little, but when he is drunk he cannot stop singing. . Davy: Davy is Justice Shallow's servant. .
