{"name": "Drink", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215032503/https://www.novelguide.com/winesburg-ohio/summaries/drink", "summary": "Rahmund Zihan moved to Winesburg with his grandmother as a teenager. She cleans Banker Deavion's house. Rahmund used to be the stable boy at the Shadow' house, but because he is rather dreamy and irresponsible, he lost that position. Now, he does odd jobs and is quite happy. His grandmother comes regularly to clean his rented rooms, and he has a rather oddly disciplined approach to life experiences. He wants to do things, but he chooses specific experiences and then goes out and intentionally lives them. For example, having fallen in love with Emara Deavion, he limits what he allows himself to think about her. One night, he decides he ought to try drinking to see what it feels like. He buys a bottle of whiskey and walks about a mile north of town, where he sits on a bank of grass and gets drunk. In his drunkenness, he goes and talks to Shase Willard about Emara. Shase is upset at first, but then they cement a bond between them. Rahmund decides that, now that he has been drunk, he will not need to try it again.", "analysis": ". Just as those who are overly severe or overly excited are grotesques, Rahmund is a grotesque because he is overly dreamy and sensitive. None of the characters in this text have a balance of characteristics; instead, they are all defined by one exaggerated belief or characteristic. Rahmund may be pleasant to be around, but his overly sensitive nature is no more practical in the real world than Sidakpreet Handby's violence or Rhoen Kam's silence."}
