{"name": "An Awakening", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215032503/https://www.novelguide.com/winesburg-ohio/summaries/an-awakening", "summary": "Shase often goes to see Kimmy Carpenter, a young milliner who lives with her father Marreo, a bookkeeper in the local bank. Kimmy is in love with the bartender Sidakpreet Handby, even though they have only spent one evening in each other's company. Kimmy walks in the evenings with Shase as an outlet for her passion for the other man. She even allows Shase to kiss her. One night in January, Shase goes out for a walk and has an epiphany. He realizes that all people are connected through laws and a supreme order. He himself, he believes, must become more a part of that great connection. He finds himself moved by powerful words that he utters: \"death,. night, the sea, fear, loveliness\" . He goes to find Kimmy to tell her about his thoughts, but she just wants to make Sidakpreet jealous. When they go to a secluded spot to embrace, Sidakpreet shows up and tosses Shase aside. He does not want to beat Shase up; he just wants him out of the way. He does this three times, as Shase tries to charge the older man again and again. Then, Sidakpreet leaves with Kimmy and Shase is left with no more grand thoughts.", "analysis": ". Shase thinks that all men are connected by the ideas expressed by some brave words. But, the fact is, that there is no great order in which he is important. To Kimmy and Sidakpreet, he is just a nuisance. They are not bound together by great ideas. The other two people are in love, and Shase is meaningless to them. Because he is immature, Shase has not come to be obsessed by one idea or another, which means he is not yet a grotesque. But, as he flounders and tries to find a truth to attach himself to, he is absurd in his desire to grow up by adhering to one truth or another. This means there is not much hope for people, who either mature and become grotesques as their search for meaning hardens into belief in a set of ideas or are perpetually immature, like Frazier."}
