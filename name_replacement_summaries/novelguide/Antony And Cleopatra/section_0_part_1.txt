The men are discussing Antony, one of the three leaders of Rome, and his doting love for the queen. They think he is making a fool of himself. Together, Antony and Cleopatra enter and he declares his love for her. A messenger comes upon them, but Antony sends him away because he does not want to leave the queen. She urges him to hear the message because it might be from his wife, Fulvia, or one of the other ruling lords, Caesar. Antony is still reluctant, however, even after her gentle prodding. Declaring he cares only for her, he dismisses the messenger and they go. The men stay and discuss the fact that Antony cares so little for the words of Caesar", "analysis": ""}
