If this cannot be granted to him, he asks that he be allowed to live as a free man in Athens. Cleopatra, for herself, asks that her heirs be allowed to gain the crown of Egypt, which is now at Caesar's mercy. To the messenger Caesar replies that he will not honor any of Antony's requests, and will only honor Cleopatra's if she turns Antony over to him, or kills him herself. The messenger leaves and Caesar stays and talks with Thidias. He tells the man to seduce Cleopatra away from Antony, and observe how Antony is taking his defeat", "analysis": ""}
