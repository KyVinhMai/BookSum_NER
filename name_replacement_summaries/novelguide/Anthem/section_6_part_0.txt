When the scholars learn that he's a lowly Street Sweeper, they immediately want him removed from their presence, not seriously considering his invention because he created it outside of their watchful gaze. Equality 7-2521 tries to persuade them to listen to him, telling them that he gives them \"the power of the sky\" and the \"key to the earth.\" The scholars respond, saying, \"What is not done collectively cannot be good.\" Furthermore, they reject his gift for the reason that it would destroy their centrally planned, candle-making industry. Thus, taken aback at their hostility to him and his idea, Equality 7-2521 jumps out a window, escaping, with his box, to the Uncharted Forest.", "analysis": ""}
