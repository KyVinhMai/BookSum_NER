The two are overjoyed at each other's company, the Golden One explaining that she wants to share his damnation. Next, the two individuals make love in a powerful, beautifully imaged author narrative, as Rand demonstrates that sex is not ugly, as the Palace of Mating makes it out to be, but that it is indeed the pinnacle of the human experience. It's \"the one ecstasy granted to the race of men,\" Equality 7-2521 boldly asserts. In this manner, both Equality 7-2521 and his lover continue to reject society's ideals and replace them with their own, though they still yearn for the Unspeakable Word.", "analysis": ""}
