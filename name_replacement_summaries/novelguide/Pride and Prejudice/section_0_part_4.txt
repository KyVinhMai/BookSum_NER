Elizabeth however, wonders at how her sister never finds fault with anybody, and how she can be \"so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others. Elizabeth does not find Bingley's sisters charming, but rather proud and conceited. It is told that Bingley inherited money from his father, and that his sisters are anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Miss Bingley is going to live at Netherfield with Bingley, and despite the differences between Bingley and Darcy, theirs is a \"very steady friendship,\" and Bingley thinks very highly of Darcy's judgement and regard", "analysis": ""}
