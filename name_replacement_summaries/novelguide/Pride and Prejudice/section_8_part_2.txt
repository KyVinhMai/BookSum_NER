Darcy shocks Elizabeth by telling her that he admires and loves her and wishes her to marry him. He speaks of how he has tried to fight his love for her because of her and her family's inferiority, and Elizabeth can see that he has no doubt that she will accept his hand. He is quite amazed when instead she does not accept, and says that she is not only offended by the speech he has just made, but that she has other reasons for declining his offer, such as how he had treated Jane and Wickham. Darcy admits to separating Bingley and Jane and rejoicing in his success at it, and he speaks with contempt of Wickham. Darcy angrily accuses Elizabeth of not being able to overlook these offenses because her pride was hurt by his speech about her family's inferiority, and Elizabeth states that the only thing those declarations did was spare her any concern she may have in refusing him. He is astonished when she says that he \"could not have made the offer of hand in any possible way that would have tempted to accept. Darcy asks Elizabeth to accept his best wishes for her health and happiness and quickly leaves the house", "analysis": ""}
