Elizabeth anxiously asks the others not to leave, knowing what is coming, but then decides it is better to get it over with. After Collins gives Elizabeth his reasons for wanting to marry, including that Lady Catherine advised it, he asks Elizabeth to marry him. Elizabeth states that it is impossible for her to accept, as they would not make each other happy. Collins, though, is not disappointed, as he believes that she is only declining in order to be modest and that he will only have to wait a bit and ask again. No matter how much Elizabeth says that she will never accept, Collins believes that she eventually will", "analysis": ""}
