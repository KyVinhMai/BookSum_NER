Her aunt also tells her that it is Darcy who has paid for Wickham to marry Lydia, but that he had wanted Mr. Gardiner to take the credit and for his part in the matter to be kept secret. As explanation of his actions, Darcy states that he feels guilty for not exposing Wickham for what he was before a situation such as this occurred. Elizabeth suspects that while this may have been his true motive, his affection for her may have also been part of it", "analysis": ""}
