They are not married, and there was no intention of being married. He states that Wickham will marry Lydia for an equal share of the five thousand pounds due the Bennet daughters after the death of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and one hundred pounds a year. Elizabeth can't believe that Wickham will marry Lydia, and Mr. Bennet is ashamed that Wickham has asked so little. He states that he wants to know how much additional money Mr. Gardiner has laid down, and wonders how he will pay him back. It then becomes clear to Elizabeth that her uncle must indeed have also given Wickham money. Elizabeth takes the letter up to her mother and reads it to her and Mary and Kitty. Immediately Mrs. Bennet forgets about all of her shame and starts to plan the wedding clothes. She also wants to go and tell the news to Mrs. Phillips and Lady Lucas", "analysis": ""}
