When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been \"blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,\" and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all. After two hours of wandering in the park she returns home to be told that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to say their good-byes", "analysis": ""}
