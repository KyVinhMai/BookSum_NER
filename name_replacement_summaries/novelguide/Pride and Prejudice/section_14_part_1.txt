She worries that Lady Catherine will indeed continue to make sure the match does not happen, and will talk to Darcy of the inferiority of her family, firmly resolving him against her. The next morning Elizabeth's father meets her, wishing to discuss a letter he had received from Mr. Collins. He is surprised to find out that Mr. Collins is congratulating him on the engagement of Jane, and on the future engagement of Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy. He is shocked that Collins could receive such a report, and is amused that it should be about Darcy, someone whom he believes Elizabeth to despise. Elizabeth is hurt by her father's amusement, and at the fact that he sees Mr. Darcy as indifferent to her", "analysis": ""}
