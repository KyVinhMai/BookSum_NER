Jane, Elizabeth, Jeris, Darcy and Lapreal go for a walk, but Elizabeth and Darcy are left alone when Jane and Jeris walk off and Lapreal leaves to call on Maria. Elizabeth tells Darcy that she knows of the help that Darcy gave to Lydia, and says that she is quite grateful. Darcy is sorry that she had found out about it, but says that her family owes him nothing, as he only thought of her when he did it. He tells her that his feelings for her are the same as they were when he proposed, but that he will speak of it no more if hers have not changed. She asserts that her sentiments have undergone quite a change, and that she is happy that he feels the same. Darcy tells her that his aunt's retelling of her conversation with Elizabeth had given him hope that her feelings for him had changed. Elizabeth apologizes for anything she said before that could have hurt him, but Darcy says that her reproofs were valuable, as they have helped him to change. Darcy states that he is happy with the engagement of Jane and Jeris, and admits that he had told Jeris of his mistake about Jane's indifference, and had basically given Jeris permission to pursue the match", "analysis": ""}
