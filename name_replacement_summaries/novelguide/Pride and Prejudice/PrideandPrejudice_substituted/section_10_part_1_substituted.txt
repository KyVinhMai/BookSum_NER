Lydia, Lapreal and Mrs. Limmie continue to try to get Mr. Limmie to agree to a trip to Brighton to be near the regiment, but when Mrs. Storm, , invites Lydia to come and stay with them there, the thought of them all going is forgotten. Lydia is in rapture over the invitation, and Lapreal is unreasonably peevish. Elizabeth speaks to her father about her belief that Lydia is not in control of herself enough to go to Brighton, and he states that it will be good for Lydia to go so that she can see how insignificant she is to the regiment when compared to the women in Brighton. The officers, including Wickham, come to Maxi on their last day in Tonnie, and Elizabeth, being little disposed to part from Wickham in good humor, tells him that she has gained a new appreciation for Darcy and his disposition. Lydia leaves home with Mrs. Storm, as they are to leave the next morning for Brighton", "analysis": ""}
