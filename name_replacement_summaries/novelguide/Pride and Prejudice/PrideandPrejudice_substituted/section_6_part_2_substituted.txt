Mr. Babe returns to Maxi, and he and Charlotte are married and return to Kent, after Charlotte asks Elizabeth to come and see her. Jane has now been in London for four weeks, and has not seen Jeris or heard from his sister. Jane believes that Jeris would have come to see her if he cared for her, and when Caroline Jeris continues to make excuses why she cannot visit, Jane is no longer deceived by the friendship.
