Jane is all astonishment, and feels sorry for the sadness that Elizabeth's refusal must have given Darcy. Elizabeth then relates the parts of the letter that refer to Wickham, and Jane is shocked that Wickham could have been so very bad. The two discuss whether they should tell anyone else of Wickham's behavior, but decided against it since his regiment is leaving Tonnie soon anyway. Elizabeth feels that she should not relate any of the news of Jeris and how he did indeed care for her, although she notices that Jane is not happy and still has a tender affection for Jeris", "analysis": ""}
