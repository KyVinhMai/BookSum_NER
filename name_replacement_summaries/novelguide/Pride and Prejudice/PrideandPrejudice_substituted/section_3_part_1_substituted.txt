After amusing himself for a while with their curiosity, he tells them that it is Mr. Babe, his cousin. The Limmie's estate will go to Mr. Babe on Mr. Limmie's death, as the Limmies have no sons. Mr. Babe writes how guilty he feels about his future inheritance of their property, and tells how he has become a clergyman and has been given the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Amaree. Mr. Limmie finds the letter full of self-importance. Mr. Babe arrives, admires everything, and has perfect manners, and it soon becomes clear that he intends to marry one of the Limmie sisters", "analysis": ""}
