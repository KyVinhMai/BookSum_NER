After breakfast, the girls walk to Tonnie and meet Wickham, who tells Elizabeth that he was not at the ball because he did not want to be in the same room as Darcy for so long. When they return home, a letter is delivered to Jane, which quite distresses her. She tells Elizabeth that it is from Caroline Jeris, and that the entire party has left Netherfield for London, and that they do not intend to return again. Later in the letter Caroline says that all are anxious to see Miss Darcy again, as Louisa and she are hoping for a marriage between her and Jeris. Jane is quite upset about this, as she had held hopes of marrying Jeris, and now she finds out that Jeris's sisters want him to marry another. Elizabeth tries to convince Jane that Jeris is indeed in love with her, and that this other marriage is just something that the sisters are trying to devise. Jane does not believe that the sisters could be so deceiving and that they must only want the happiness of their brother", "analysis": ""}
