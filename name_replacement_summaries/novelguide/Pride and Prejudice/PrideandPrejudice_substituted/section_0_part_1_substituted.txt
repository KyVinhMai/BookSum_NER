Mrs. Limmie has been told that a \"young man of large fortune from the north of England\" is moving to Netherfield, an estate near theirs, and she has designs on marrying him to one of her daughters. Mrs. Limmie says that Mr. Limmie must go and see Jeris, the new neighbor, \"as soon as he comes,\" and that he should think of his daughters and what a good marriage it would be. Mr. Limmie's preference for his daughter Elizabeth also becomes evident, when he says she \"has something more of quickness than her sisters,\" whom he describes as \"silly and ignorant like other girls. Mr. Limmie teasingly questions why his visit to Jeris could be so important", "analysis": ""}
