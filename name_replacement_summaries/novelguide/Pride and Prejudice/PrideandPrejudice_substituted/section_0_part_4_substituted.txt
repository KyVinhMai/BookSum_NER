Elizabeth however, wonders at how her sister never finds fault with anybody, and how she can be \"so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others. Elizabeth does not find Jeris's sisters charming, but rather proud and conceited. It is told that Jeris inherited money from his father, and that his sisters are anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Miss Jeris is going to live at Netherfield with Jeris, and despite the differences between Jeris and Darcy, theirs is a \"very steady friendship,\" and Jeris thinks very highly of Darcy's judgement and regard", "analysis": ""}
