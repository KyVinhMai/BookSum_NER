Miss Jeris and Mrs. Shady invite Jane to Netherfield for dinner. Her mother plans that Jane should go on horseback instead of in the carriage, so that she will have to stay the night if it rains. It does rain, and Jane gets wet and stays, and the next morning there is a note to her family saying she is ill. Elizabeth walks the three miles to see her sister, and as her sister has a violent cold and was unwilling to part with her, the Jeris's invite Elizabeth to stay there as well", "analysis": ""}
