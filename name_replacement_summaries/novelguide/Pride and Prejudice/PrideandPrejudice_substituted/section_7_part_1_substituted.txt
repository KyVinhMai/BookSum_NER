They walk to Lady Catherine's, and Sir William and Maria are quite nervous. Mr. Babe admires and compliments everything, and Lady Catherine is gratified by the admiration. After dinner Lady Catherine asks Charlotte about domestic concerns, giving her advice on even the smallest details about running her house. She then asks Elizabeth many questions, and is quite surprised to find out that they had no governess in a house with five girls. Lady Catherine is shocked at Elizabeth and how she does not answer all of her questions directly, but rather sometimes trifles with her", "analysis": ""}
