Jane is concerned that everyone will be talking about her and Jeris, and she is determined to show them that she can be friends with him. Mrs. Limmie, paralleling the beginning of the book, tells Mr. Limmie that he must call on Jeris as soon as he arrives, and when he refuses, says that she will invite him to dinner nonetheless. When Jeris arrives, he rides to Maxi, and Mrs. Limmie is sorry to see that Mr. Darcy is with him. Both Jane and Elizabeth are uncomfortable, and Mrs. Limmie says that she will be civil to Darcy only for Jeris's sake. During the visit, Jeris speaks more and more to Jane, and Darcy hardly speaks, making Elizabeth wonder why he has come at all", "analysis": ""}
