{"name": "Chapter 61", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201020001144/https://www.novelguide.com/pride-and-prejudice/summaries/chap61", "summary": "Mrs. Limmie is happy on the day that she marries off two of her daughters, and talks much of Mrs. Jeris and Mrs. Darcy. Mr. Limmie misses Elizabeth at home, so he often visits Divine. Jeris and Jane remain at Netherfield a short time, but then buy an estate within thirty miles of Divine. Lapreal spends much time with both of her elder sisters, and away from the influence of Lydia, her improvement in manners and temper is great. Lydia often invites Lapreal to visit her, but Mr. Limmie will not allow it. Wickham and Lydia are often wanting for money, and ask often for it from Elizabeth and Jane, who provide some. Wickham's affection for Lydia soon sinks into indifference, while Lydia's affection lasts a little longer. Lydia is occasionally a visitor at Divine, but Wickham is not invited there. Mary is the only daughter left at home, and she is forced by Mrs. Limmie, who does not want to be alone, to forgo some of her books for time with her. Miss Jeris is mortified by Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth, but as she wants to still be welcome at Divine, she tries to be civil. Miss Darcy lives now at Divine, and she and Elizabeth form an attachment as Darcy had hoped they would. The marriage of her nephew to Elizabeth angers Lady Catherine, but eventually the curiosity of how Elizabeth conducts herself as Darcy's wife is too great, and she visits Divine. Darcy and Elizabeth are always on intimate terms with the Gardiners, as they have the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing Elizabeth to visit Divine, had been the means of uniting them.", "analysis": ""}
