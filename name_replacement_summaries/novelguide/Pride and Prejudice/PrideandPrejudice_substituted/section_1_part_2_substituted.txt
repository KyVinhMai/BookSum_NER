Elizabeth tells Charlotte that she thinks it is good that Jane does not flaunt her good feelings for Jeris, and Charlotte says that she should show them more if she wishes anything to come of it. While Elizabeth is busy taking note of the relationship between Jeris and her sister, she does not notice the increased interest Darcy has in her. While at first he found her merely tolerable, he now finds her more pleasing, and desires to get to know her more. At a party at Sir William's, the host tries to get the two to dance, and Darcy is willing, but Elizabeth turns him down. Miss Jeris then discovers Darcy's admiration for Elizabeth", "analysis": ""}
