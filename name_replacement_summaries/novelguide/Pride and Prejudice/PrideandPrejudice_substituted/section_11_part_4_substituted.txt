Mrs. Gardiner and the children decide to stay in Maxi for a few days to try to help, and on Tuesday she receives a letter from her husband saying that he and Mr. Limmie are searching the hotels in town for Lydia and Wickham. A letter soon arrives from Mr. Babe saying that he has heard of their misfortune, and writing Mr. Limmie that it would be best for him to \"throw off your unworthy child from your affections for ever. Mr. Gardiner writes again saying he has no news yet other than that Wickham does not seem to have any family or friends that they could be staying with, and that he left a number of gambling debts in Brighton. Mr. Limmie returns home, and Mrs. Gardiner and her children leave. Mr. Limmie tells Elizabeth that she was justified in her advice to him before Lydia left, and that he has learnt to be cautious about his daughters", "analysis": ""}
