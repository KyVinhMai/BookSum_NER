From her they learn that a militia regiment is stationed in Meryton. Every day they learn more about the officers, and they soon become acquainted with some of them. Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst invite Jane to Netherfield for dinner. Her mother plans that Jane should go on horseback instead of in the carriage, so that she will have to stay the night if it rains. It does rain, and Jane gets wet and stays, and the next morning there is a note to her family saying she is ill. Elizabeth walks the three miles to see her sister, and as her sister has a violent cold and was unwilling to part with her, the Bingley's invite Elizabeth to stay there as well", "analysis": ""}
