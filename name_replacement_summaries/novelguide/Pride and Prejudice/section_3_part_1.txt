After amusing himself for a while with their curiosity, he tells them that it is Mr. Collins, his cousin. The Bennet's estate will go to Mr. Collins on Mr. Bennet's death, as the Bennets have no sons. Mr. Collins writes how guilty he feels about his future inheritance of their property, and tells how he has become a clergyman and has been given the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Mr. Bennet finds the letter full of self-importance. Mr. Collins arrives, admires everything, and has perfect manners, and it soon becomes clear that he intends to marry one of the Bennet sisters", "analysis": ""}
