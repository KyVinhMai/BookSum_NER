She decides to take a walk, and when she hears Darcy calling her, she tries to avoid him. When he catches up to her, he gives her a letter, asking her to read it. The letter starts by saying that Elizabeth need not worry about him trying to renew any of his offers, but that he feels that he should explain the circumstances around the two accusations she made against him. In reference to his talking Bingley into leaving Netherfield, he states that he had seen Bingley in love many times before, and that he did not realize how serious this relationship was until the ball when he heard Sir William and others speaking of how they expected a marriage. He then observed Bingley and Jane closer, and while he saw that Bingley was clearly affected by Jane, he thought Jane seemed more indifferent to Bingley. When he explained his concerns about the inferiority of Jane's family to him, Bingley was not willing to give her up, but when Darcy told him that he felt Jane indifferent, Bingley agreed to leave. With respect to Wickham, Darcy also explains. He writes that his father indeed had the highest opinion of him, but that after his death Wickham received an agreed upon sum, and when it was gone, came back for more to support his \"life of idleness and dissipation. Darcy would not give him more money, and did not hear from him a while, until he found out from his sister that she felt herself in love with him. Darcy arrived in time to stop the elopement. Darcy concludes his letter by hoping that she will acquit him of any cruelty towards Wickham, and that if she needs any proof of the truth of what he had written, she could talk to Colonel Fitzwilliam", "analysis": ""}
