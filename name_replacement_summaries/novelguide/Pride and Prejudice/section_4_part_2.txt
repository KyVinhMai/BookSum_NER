Indeed he is not there, and Mr. Denny says that he had to go to town on business. The first two dances were \"dances of mortification,\" as Collins was \"awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it. Elizabeth is then taken by surprise by Darcy, and before she realizes it, has agreed to dance the next two dances with him. Elizabeth tries to talk to Darcy during the dancing, as she knows that he would prefer not too, and when the conversation turns to Wickham, Darcy again changes color. He says that while Wickham is good at making friends, he is not good at keeping them. Sir William then dances near the couple, and Darcy gets quite serious when Sir William makes an allusion to how congratulations may soon be in order for Bingley and Jane. Elizabeth is later embarrassed by her family's conduct, when her mother openly discusses the relationship between Bingley and Jane and when Mary sings badly. The Bennet family is the last to leave, and it is clear that the Bingley sisters wish they would go, and Bingley and Jane are again alone talking away from the group", "analysis": ""}
