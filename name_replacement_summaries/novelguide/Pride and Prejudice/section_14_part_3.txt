Later in the evening Elizabeth tells Jane of what occurred between she and Darcy, and Jane is incredulous. It takes a bit of convincing for Jane to finally believe that Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy had changed and for her to be happy for her. The next day Mrs. Bennet makes more disparaging remarks when she sees Darcy coming, and makes Elizabeth walk out with him again so that the rest of the family does not have to be around him. During their walk it is decided that Darcy will ask Mr. Bennet for his consent to his daughter's hand that evening. When the evening arrives, and Darcy leaves from his conference with her father smiling, Elizabeth is somewhat relieved, but she is still nervous about disappointing her father with her choice of husband. Mr. Bennet asks Elizabeth if she is out of her senses, as he thought that she had always hated the man. As with Jane, it takes a bit of convincing to make her father see that she is indeed in love with Darcy, and he accepts the match. She also tells her father of what Darcy had done for Lydia, and he is relieved that it was not his brother-in-law after all, as he knows that Darcy will not receive repayment from him. That night Elizabeth follows her mother upstairs to tell her the news. She is quite shocked, but then gets quite excited about how much money Elizabeth will have, and how she will have three daughters married", "analysis": ""}
