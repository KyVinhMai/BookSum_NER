Mr. Bennet is not quite so cordial, and Elizabeth and Jane are surprised by Lydia's lack of embarrassment. Lydia goes on and on about how happy she is and what a wonderful marriage she has made, until Elizabeth can take no more and must leave the room. Lydia says, \"I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. Lydia says that she will invite her sisters to the North for that purpose, but Elizabeth says, \" I thank you for my share of the favour, but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands. Even though Elizabeth had rather not hear about it, Lydia tells her about the events of her wedding day, including that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Elizabeth is shocked at the mention of him, but Lydia will say no more, as she has remembered that she had promised him and Wickham not to say anything about his presence. Elizabeth can of course think of nothing other than what he could be doing there, and sends off a letter to Mrs. Gardiner asking her about it", "analysis": ""}
