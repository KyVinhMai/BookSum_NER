At the mention of Derbyshire, Elizabeth thinks of Darcy, and his estate there, Pemberley. When the Gardiner's do finally arrive they leave their children in the care of Jane, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth leave for their trip. Mrs. Gardiner expresses a wish to see Pemberley again, and thinks that Jane will want to see the place she has heard so much about. Elizabeth is distressed that she might meet Darcy while walking the grounds until she learns from the hotel chambermaid that the family is not there for the summer", "analysis": ""}
