She asks Elizabeth to take a walk with her, and proceeds to tell her that she is alarmed by the rumors that she is to marry her nephew Darcy. She insists on having the rumor contradicted, as she does not approve of the match because of the inferiority of Elizabeth's family. Elizabeth talks around Lady Catherine's questions, and Lady Catherine finds her impertinent, and insists that she speak to her frankly. Lady Catherine says that Darcy and her daughter are destined for each other, and demands to know if Elizabeth means to marry Darcy. Elizabeth asks how she could be engaged to Darcy if he is engaged to Miss De Bourgh. Lady Catherine gets increasingly irritated, and Elizabeth finally tells her that she is not engaged to Darcy. Lady Catherine seems relieved by this, but when she asks Elizabeth to promise that she will never enter into such an engagement, Elizabeth refuses. Lady Catherine leaves angrily, saying that she will continue to make sure that she and Darcy are not married", "analysis": ""}
