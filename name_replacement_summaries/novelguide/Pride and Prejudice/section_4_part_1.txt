Jane feels that there must be some misunderstanding on some side, as it is impossible that any man of common humanity could treat his father's favorite in such a way. Elizabeth still believes Wickham, and will wait until Darcy tells her different. Mr. Bingley and his sisters come to invite the family to their ball at Netherfield, but do not stay long as to not have to converse much with Mrs. Bennet or the two younger sisters. All are excited about the ball, and even Mary, who often does not participate in activities, says she will attend. Elizabeth is especially excited, as she believes she will see Wickham there. She is distressed when Mr. Collins asks her for the first two dances, as she had hoped to dance these with Wickham", "analysis": ""}
