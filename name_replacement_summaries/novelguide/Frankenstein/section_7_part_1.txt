After a few lines it becomes obvious that this \"monster\" isn't the coldhearted heathen Victor has portrayed. In fact, Frankenstein's creation is very human-like: he has feelings, desires and even his own distinct personality. Indeed we develop a genuine sense of pity, not loathing, for the beast once he relates his difficult situation to the reader. Backing up to the first moment of his consciousness, he explains that it takes some time for his eyes to adjust to the bright light of the day, and so he decides to take refuge in the nearby forest. Though he's always very hungry, he manages to survive on berries and acorns. Once, when he tries to imitate the beautiful sounds of the birds he hears, his own voice terrifies him. Thus, he is unable to express himself, let alone determine the meaning of his existence. Eventually, he spies a small hut some distance away. When he enters, hoping to find food and shelter, the shepherd who inhabits the house sprints away in terror. This surprises and dismays the beast, but he is happy to use the hut. Soon he builds his own small shelter, hidden in the dense forest, made of wood and straw. The being explains, \"Here then I retreated, and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man. Soon he realizes that he's not alone in the forest when he discovers a nearby cottage. After observing it for a time, he concludes that three people live there: a young man, a young woman, and an elderly gentleman", "analysis": ""}
