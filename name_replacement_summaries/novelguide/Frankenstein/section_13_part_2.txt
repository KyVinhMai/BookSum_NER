{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200927043357/https://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/summaries/chap23-24", "summary": "In Shelley's final chapter, Victor leaves Geneva in pursuit of the monster. He resolves to kill the beast once and for all, if it's the last thing he does. The pursuit goes on for days and days, until finally they are near the north pole. Both Frankenstein and his monster employ the use of dog-sleds to traverse the icy stretches of the uninhabited north country. Midway through the chapter, Robert Walton again assumes control of the narration. He resumes his letter to his sister, explaining that Victor's only care in life is to kill his creation. Unfortunately, the ship is surrounded by ice and it seems that neither Walton nor his crew will see England again. Fearing mutiny, however, Walton agrees to return to England should the ice break and the passage be made open. Victor is opposed to any southern travel, imploring Walton to stay and help him track down the monster. Yet he realizes that this is not their responsibility, and resolves to be left alone to face his enemy. Victor's health continues to decline, however, and it seems that he will not last long. Just when Walton believes that Victor is dead, the monster finds his way into the Captain's quarters and stands over Victor's body, relishing the idea that his creator is dead. The sight of the creature abhors Walton, but the monster says that his mission is over, that he will not seek any more human blood. Walton and his crew leave the monster to die willingly on the ice, making their way back to warmer reaches", "analysis": ""}
