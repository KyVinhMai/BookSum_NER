The old man comes from a wealthy French family; his name is De Lacey. Safie and her father are Turkish. The two families meet in Paris, where the Turks have lived for many years. Yet because he is a wealthy foreigner, the French government decides to arrest Safie's father, despite the public indignation. Felix is especially upset at this injustice, and when the man is put in jail, Felix helps him escape. In return for this noble service, the Turk promises Felix that he can marry his beautiful daughter, and soon he and Safie fall in love. Yet Safie's father double-crosses Felix and heads back to Constantinople, instructing his daughter to follow with the rest of their belongings. Meanwhile, the French government discovers Felix's crime and puts Agatha and the old man in jail. Felix returns to Paris to attend the trial of his family. After five months, the trial takes place, after which Felix and his family lose their wealth and are forced to leave France. They take up residence in the cottage where they presently live. Safie, the daughter of a Christian Arab, hates the thought of what her life will be if she returns to Turkey, so instead of following her father's instructions, she decides to find the new residence of Felix and his family for herself", "analysis": ""}
