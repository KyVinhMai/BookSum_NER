This man-Beaufort-eventually dies, leaving Caroline alone and very poor. After two years, however, she and Alphonse Frankenstein marry. Victor is born a few years later. He has a very enjoyable childhood, and loves his parents very much. Eventually, the family adopts Elizabeth-an orphan girl-and she and Victor develop a special relationship.
