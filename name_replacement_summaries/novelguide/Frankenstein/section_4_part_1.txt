As soon as the monster comes to life, however, Victor is filled with intense revulsion. He explains, \"the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. He immediately leaves his apartment, feeling a mental breakdown coming on. Outside he bumps into Henry Clerval, his dear childhood friend who has come to Ingolstadt to visit Frankenstein and study oriental languages. Victor is very agitated still, but keeps himself from telling Henry what the matter is; the presence of Clerval helps him to relax. Clerval relates that everyone is fine at home, though worried that Victor hasn't written lately. Finally the two return to his apartment, and Frankenstein anxiously peaks into his room, relieved to discover that the beast has disappeared", "analysis": ""}
