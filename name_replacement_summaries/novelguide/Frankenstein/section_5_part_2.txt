Apparently the girl is missing the whole night of the murder, but the most damaging evidence is that she is found with a certain picture in her pocket which all but proves that she is the murderer. Elizabeth gave this picture to William just before he left to go on his fateful walk in the forest. Justine is unable to explain how she came to possess the picture. The morning after the trial, Victor hears that the young girl has confessed that she is indeed the murderer. When he and Elizabeth question her about it, Justine admits that she did confess but that she \"confessed a lie. This only troubles Victor and the others more, but nevertheless, Justine is executed the following day. Victor is guilt-ridden beyond belief, telling Walton that William and Justine were the \"first hapless victims\" of his \"unhallowed arts", "analysis": ""}
