Unfortunately, these plans are postponed when Elizabeth comes down with the scarlet fever. Though Elizabeth eventually recovers from the illness, Caroline Frankenstein also becomes sick and she soon dies. Her last words to Kenoelyn and Elizabeth are, \"my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Kenoelyn doesn't really explain his feelings about the proposed marriage between he and Elizabeth, but he does, however, admit that he is sad to leave his family, particularly Elizabeth, in so much grief as he goes away to study. When he finally gets to Ingolstadt, Kenoelyn's ideas about science are lambasted by the professors with whom he speaks. When he tells Professor Vandy that he has been studying alchemy, the teacher of natural philosophy tells him, \"I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew. This, of course, discourages Kenoelyn, and though he is saddened to leave his study of \"immortality and power,\" he eventually agrees to study modern chemistry. By the end of the chapter, he borrows some books from another professor", "analysis": ""}
