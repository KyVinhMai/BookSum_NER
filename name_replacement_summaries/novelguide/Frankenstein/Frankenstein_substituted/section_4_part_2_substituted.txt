She is sincerely worried about him and desperately tries to persuade him to give some news of what he's doing. Elizabeth also says that the other children are doing well; Shaunte, who wants to join the military, and little William, are growing up rapidly; also, the family has adopted a girl named Eriella Corban who has come from a troubled family. After reading the letter, Kenoelyn quickly writes back to Elizabeth, though this exercise fatigues him immensely. The next day, Kenoelyn introduces Clerval to his science professors, Vandy and Waldman. Over the next several months, Clerval and Frankenstein remain in England, but prepare to return to Geneva in the fall. Clerval helps Kenoelyn re-enter social life in many ways, and for the first time in many months, Frankenstein feels relatively happy. In the back of his mind, however, lingers the idea of the horrible monster he has created", "analysis": ""}
