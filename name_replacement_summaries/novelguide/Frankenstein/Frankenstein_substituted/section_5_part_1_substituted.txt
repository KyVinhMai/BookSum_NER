Apparently Elizabeth has taken the news very hard. She weeps continually,\" Mr. Frankenstein laments. Kenoelyn's heart sinks, and he decides to leave promptly for Geneva. Near home, during a thunderstorm, Kenoelyn is startled to see a large figure peering at him through the dark trees of the forest. He explains, \"A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch , the filthy demon, to whom I had given life. It's at this time that Kenoelyn realizes that his monster is the murderer. He finishes his sorrowful trip home, burdened with a guilty conscience. Upon his arrival, Kenoelyn hears more terrible news: Eriella, their adopted child, has been accused of killing William. This confuses everyone, especially Kenoelyn, because he believes that his own creation is the perpetrator, though the evidence seems to point to Eriella", "analysis": ""}
