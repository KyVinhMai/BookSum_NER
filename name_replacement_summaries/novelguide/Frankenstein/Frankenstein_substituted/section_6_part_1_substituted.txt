Frankenstein reveals, \"I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures, such as no language can describe. This theme of self-loathing remains throughout the rest of the book. While alone, rowing a small boat in the middle of a nearby lake, Kenoelyn even contemplates suicide. Yet the thought of Elizabeth's devastation keeps him from taking the plunge. He admits that he loves Elizabeth very much. Frankenstein's sadness is mingled with a perpetual fear that a new tragedy will befall the family. He narrates, I had been the author of unalterable evils; and I live in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. In the remaining portion of the chapter, Kenoelyn describes his solitary ascent into the Alps", "analysis": ""}
