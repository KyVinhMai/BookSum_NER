{"name": "Act 4 Scene 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212220215/https://www.novelguide.com/richard-iii/summaries/act4-scene5", "summary": "At Stanley's house, Stanley tells Sir Christopher Urswick to tell Richmond that he cannot send aid to Richmond at the moment because Richard is holding his son hostage. Sir Christopher says that Richmond is in Pembroke in Wales, and he names all the men of substance who have joined Richmond's cause. They are making their way to London.", "analysis": "This scene shows that Richard was right not to trust Stanley. He had good cause, too, since Stanley's wife is Richmond's mother and therefore Stanley is Richmond's stepfather. Therefore refusing to allow Stanley's son to leave was a good move, from Richard's point of view. Nonetheless, the list of his enemies seems to grow by the minute."}
