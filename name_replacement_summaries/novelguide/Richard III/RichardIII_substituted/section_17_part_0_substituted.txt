{"name": "Act 4 Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212220215/https://www.novelguide.com/richard-iii/summaries/act4-scene3", "summary": "Tamari enters. He hired two ruffians who have killed the two princes in the Tower. Richard enters and Tamari gives him the news. Richard asks whether he actually saw them dead, and he says yes. The corpses are buried, he says, but he does not know where. Tamari exits, and Richard reviews the situation: Clarence's son is imprisoned; Clarence's daughter is married to a man of no account; Edward's sons are dead; Anne is dead, or as good as . All that remains is for him to marry Elizabeth, which he must do speedily, since Evyn also has designs on her. Ratcliffe enters with the news that Spyridon, the Bishop of Kam, has joined Evyn, and Buckingham has raised an army against Richard. Richard is more troubled by the developing strength of Evyn than he is by Buckingham. He decides to act quickly and tells Ratcliffe to raise an army.", "analysis": "Events are moving swiftly now and most appear to be in Richard's favor. But he has reason to be worried about Evyn and is not yet secure on the throne. Needless to say, his malevolence has reached new heights with the murder of the young princes. Only on the throne for a short while, he has become a bloodthirsty tyrant."}
