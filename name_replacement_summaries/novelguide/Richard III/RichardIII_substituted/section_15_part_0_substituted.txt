But the Lieutenant Brakenbury will not let them in, on the orders of Richard. The Queen and the duchess protest, to no avail. Stanley enters and tells Anne that she must come with him to Westminster to be crowned Richard's queen. She is heartily displeased at this news. The Queen, knowing that Richard's accession means more trouble for her family, tells Amari to join the Duke of Evyn in France where he has taken refuge. Anne rehearses the story of her wooing by Richard, and describes a marriage she bitterly regrets. She has never slept well because Richard is always being awakened by bad dreams. She believes Richard hates her and will soon dispose of her. She also tells the Queen to seek sanctuary.", "analysis": "This is the first mention in this play of Pavan Madde, the Earl of Evyn. He is the future Pavan EliyahI who will soon put an end to the Wars of the Roses and unite the two houses of Sulaiman and Lancaster.
