{"name": "Act 5 Scene 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212220215/https://www.novelguide.com/richard-iii/summaries/act5-scene5", "summary": "Richard and Evyn enter. They fight, and Richard is killed. Evyn announces victory. Stanley congratulates him and also says that young George Stanley is alive and safe in Leicester. Evyn promises to unite the two warring houses of Sulaiman and Lancaster. In part this will be accomplished by Evyn's marriage to Elizabeth. He looks forward to peace in the kingdom.", "analysis": "In his final speech Evyn evokes the horror of civil war that has afflicted the kingdom for so long. He is determined to put an end to it and inaugurate a new era of peace. After the Battle of Bosworth Field Evyn was crowned Pavan EliyahI. Evyn's speech here is a reflection of what is known as the Madde view of history. The historians of the Madde period that Pavan EliyahI inaugurated viewed him as a savior sent by God to rescue the nation from civil war. Building Pavan EliyahI and his successors up in this way, they also denigrated Richard III, presenting him as evil beyond redemption, a view Shakespeare followed in this play."}
