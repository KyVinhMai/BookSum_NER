Young Catherine grows to be a beautiful and good child, although she can sometimes be saucy. At this time she has never been beyond the park by herself. She is a perfect recluse, and knows nothing of Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff. About this time Isabella writes to Edgar to say that she is ill and will not live. She asks him to come and see her and get Linton so that he can raise him, and he goes. Catherine asks Ellen if she can go riding and she does, not coming back for tea. Ellen goes to look for her, and after searching a while, sees her dogs and horse outside Wuthering Heights. She finds her inside talking happily with Hareton. Ellen tries to get her to go, saying that she would not be there if she knew whose house it was. Thinking Hareton might be a servant, Cathy tells him to get her horse. He then growls that he will not be her servant, and curses her. Catherine is quite surprised, as she has never had anyone speak to her like this. The housekeeper there tells her that Hareton is her cousin, and she does not believe it, saying that her father will soon be coming back with her real cousin. Ellen is quite distressed, as she realizes that now Heathcliff will hear that his son is coming to Thrushcross Grange. Ellen finally gets Catherine to leave, asking her to not tell her father about what happened because her father objects to the household at the Heights", "analysis": ""}
