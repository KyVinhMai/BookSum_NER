Before she came to Thrushcross Grange, Mrs. Dean was almost always at Wuthering Heights. She remembers playing with Hindley and Catherine Earnshaw, as her mother was their nurse. One day she remembers Mr. Earnshaw going on a journey and promising to bring back a fiddle for Hindley, a riding whip for Cathy and apples and pears for her. He is gone a long while, and when he comes back he has with him an orphan that he could not let starve in the street. The fiddle is crushed, and he has lost the whip, and the children and his wife do not like the dirty, ragged, black-haired child that he has brought home. He is named Heathcliff, and soon he and Cathy are good friends, but Hindley still hates him. Mr. Earnshaw thinks much of Heathcliff and raises him as part of the family, taking his side against his own son Hindley often. Hindley and Heathcliff fight often, but Heathcliff does not complain, making Mrs. Dean think that he is not vindictive. She learns that she has been deceived", "analysis": ""}
