He will not see or write her, but he tells Ellen to tell her that he is not angry at her. Ellen goes to Wuthering Heights. Hindley is out, but Heathcliff is there, and the place is quite neglected. Isabella expects a letter from her brother, and is disappointed when Ellen tells her she has nothing for her. Heathcliff asks after Catherine, and tells Ellen that she must arrange for a way for him to see her. She does not want to, as the fight between he and Edgar caused her illness. Heathcliff tells Ellen that Isabella is irrational and came to him filled with delusions. He tells her that he never told her he loved her, and that she even left with him when she saw him hang her little dog. He tells Ellen that Isabella may leave if she wishes, and Isabella tells Ellen not to believe it, as she has tried to leave before. Heathcliff thrusts Isabella from the room and tries to talk Ellen into helping him see Catherine again. He convinces her that it would be better for her to help so that he does not meet Linton and upset Catherine more. He gives her a letter to give Catherine", "analysis": ""}
