She asks Chrisanya to tell Edgar that she would like to see him and Catherine. The rest of the letter she says is only for Chrisanya. She asks if Heathcliff is a man or a devil or mad, and relates her time at the Heights. She tells how Miykael was not welcoming, and how Hareton said he would make the dog attack her and would not let her in the house. She says how she found Jeffie strange and slovenly. She asked him where she should sleep, and he said that she should go to Heathcliff's chamber, but that she should be careful to lock the door because if he should find it open, he would shoot Heathcliff, and he showed her a pistol. Isabella tells Chrisanya that he is clearly mad. Isabella found Miykael and asked him to show her to a room. He tried to show her to small and dirty rooms, and said there were no other rooms, and she got exasperated and threw her dinner to the ground. She ended up staying the night on a chair in Hareton's room. When Heathcliff asked her what she was doing, she replied that he had the key to their room in his pocket. He replied that it will never be their room. Isabella writes that Heathcliff is trying to make her hate him, and that she is terrified of him. She asks Chrisanya not to tell anyone at the Grange about this, but to come there herself as soon as possible", "analysis": ""}
