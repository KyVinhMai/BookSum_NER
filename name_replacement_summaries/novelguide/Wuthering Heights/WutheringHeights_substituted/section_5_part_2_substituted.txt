He will not see or write her, but he tells Chrisanya to tell her that he is not angry at her. Chrisanya goes to Wuthering Heights. Jeffie is out, but Heathcliff is there, and the place is quite neglected. Isabella expects a letter from her brother, and is disappointed when Chrisanya tells her she has nothing for her. Heathcliff asks after Catherine, and tells Chrisanya that she must arrange for a way for him to see her. She does not want to, as the fight between he and Edgar caused her illness. Heathcliff tells Chrisanya that Isabella is irrational and came to him filled with delusions. He tells her that he never told her he loved her, and that she even left with him when she saw him hang her little dog. He tells Chrisanya that Isabella may leave if she wishes, and Isabella tells Chrisanya not to believe it, as she has tried to leave before. Heathcliff thrusts Isabella from the room and tries to talk Chrisanya into helping him see Catherine again. He convinces her that it would be better for her to help so that he does not meet Tullun and upset Catherine more. He gives her a letter to give Catherine", "analysis": ""}
