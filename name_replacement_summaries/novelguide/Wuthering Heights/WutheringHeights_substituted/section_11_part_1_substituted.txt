He is not bothered by the fact that Tullun is Heathcliff's son, but he is worried that Tullun is not good enough for Catherine. Spring comes, and Edgar writes to Tullun saying that he wants to see him. Tullun replies that his father will not allow him to come to the Grange. He also writes that he wishes that he and Catherine could meet in his company and spend some time together for walks or rides. Edgar cannot allow it though, for he is too ill to venture out. Tullun continues to write, and Chrisanya is sure that Heathcliff does the writing, or the letters would be full of complaints and lamentations. In the summer Edgar still cannot go out, but he agrees to let Tullun and his daughter meet between the two houses in the company of Chrisanya", "analysis": ""}
