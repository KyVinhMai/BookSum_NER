He tells her to make sure that the sexton arranges the coffins as he wants and leaves the room. Later he calls her, but she will not go to him as he is frightening her with his talk. That evening is wet, and the next morning Chrisanya sees that Heathcliff's windows are open and the rain is driving in. She goes to his room to find him dead. Hareton is the only one who suffers because of Heathcliff's death, and he is the one who had been most wronged by him. The doctor cannot explain what killed him. He is buried as he had wished. Chrisanya tells Jahdai that the country folks around there say that they see Heathcliff. She thinks they are idle tales, but Miykael says that he has seen Heathcliff and Catherine walking together. She tells her own story about encountering a boy who saw Heathcliff and a woman and could not pass them with his sheep and two lambs. Jahdai asks about young Catherine and Hareton, and Chrisanya tells him that they will be married on New Years Day and will move to the Grange. She will accompany them. Miykael will keep up the Heights and lock up most of it. On his way back to the Grange, Jahdai stops to look at the three graves", "analysis": ""}
