Catherine talks of leaving, but Linton looks fearfully towards the Heights and asks them to stay another half hour. He tells Catherine to tell her father that he is in good health, and that if she should run across Heathcliff not to tell him how quiet he was during their meeting. He also tells her to come back the next Thursday. When they part, Catherine tells Linton that she is disappointed in their meeting", "analysis": ""}
