She releases it and runs on. The doctor asks about Heathcliff, and says that he had heard that he and Isabella had been seen together the night before. This news frightens Ellen, and when she goes into Isabella's room, she finds it empty. She does not want to tell Edgar of it then, as he is busy with Catherine. The doctor tells them to keep Catherine in perfect tranquillity. They all are busy taking care of her, and eventually a maid comes to say that Isabella has run off with Heathcliff. She says that she heard it from another that they were seen together in the middle of the night. Linton says that no one is to go after them as Isabella went of her own accord. He says that they are to talk of her no more, for while he did not disown her, she disowned him", "analysis": ""}
