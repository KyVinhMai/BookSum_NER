When Heathcliff is out of the room, Lockwood makes a face at the dog, and she jumps at him, along with six or so other dogs that seem to come out of nowhere. No one seems to heed his cries, but then a woman finally does come out of the kitchen to fight the dogs off, and Heathcliff returns. He gives Lockwood some wine; they talk of Thrushcross Grange, and when Lockwood leaves, he feels that Heathcliff does not want him to repeat the visit, but he has decided to anyway", "analysis": ""}
