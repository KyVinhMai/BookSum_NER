He finds it best to change his will so that Catherine will get his property and Heathcliff will not, and sends for his lawyer, Mr. Green. Ellen sends four men to Wuthering Heights to get Catherine. The lawyer sends word that he cannot come now, but will soon come, and the four men return saying that Heathcliff had told them that Catherine was too ill to be moved. Ellen scolds them for their stupidity, and resolves to go there at daylight. The next morning Catherine herself comes. She goes to her father, and he soon dies blissfully and quietly with her. The lawyer finally comes after going to Wuthering Heights for his instructions. He had been bought off by Heathcliff and so did not arrive in time for Edgar to change his will. Mr. Green fires all of the servants except Ellen. Catherine tells Ellen that Linton finally helped her because she was so full of anguish. He let her out of her room, and she went into her mother's old room and crawled out the window", "analysis": ""}
