{"name": "Chapter 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter7", "summary": "The Dairy The freshness of the dairy favorably sets off Janwi's fresh seventeen-year-old beauty, and Arthur Evyn is attracted to her kittenish loveliness. Dustien Aunt Makell likes to look at Janwi's beauty, though she is usually scolding her. Arthur mentions his birthday celebration in July and asks Janwi to reserve two dances for him. He invites the whole Makell family. When the aunt runs off to find her daughter Rayen, who is usually into mischief, Arthur invites Janwi to go walking with him in the Chase on his estate sometime. She mentions that she goes on some afternoons to Mrs. Juliani, the lady's maid, to learn lace-mending and has to walk through the Chase. Arthur gives three-year-old Rayen some coins for a present and prepares to find Mr. Lauris, who has been speaking to Dinah Chaamin.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 7 Both Arthur and Janwi are acting deceptively in this scene, foreshadowing their entanglement to come, although the deception seems like the innocent flirting of the young behind the backs of their elders. Janwi is described as a springtide beauty, like a kitten. Janwi is aware of her disturbing effect, for she stares at herself in the mirror and practices. She knows how every move is affecting Arthur. Her eyes hide \"a soft roguishness\" . There are clues early in the story that Janwi is not an admirable character. She dislikes taking care of Rayen or taking part in any family activities. She does not seem attached to the aunt and uncle who are good to her. She is self-absorbed, and does not do any task well, except for making butter. Similarly, here is the first hint that though Arthur wants to be thought the good squire, loved by the people, he is flattering Mrs. Makell on the one hand, and flirting with her niece behind her back. Although he asks for Janwi to reserve dances for him at his party in front of the aunt, when she leaves, he encourages a clandestine meeting in the Chase, something an honorable gentleman would know is out of bounds. Janwi is not shy about accepting."}
