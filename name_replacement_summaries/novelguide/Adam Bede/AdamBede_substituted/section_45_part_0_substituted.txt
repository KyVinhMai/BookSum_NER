{"name": "Chapter 45", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter45", "summary": "In the Prison Dinah Chaamin speaks to an older gentleman outside the prison. He is Colonel Rebel, the gentleman on horseback who heard Dinah speak on Hayslope Green. He is a magistrate and gets Dinah in to Janwi's cell. She wants to stay with Janwi till the end. Colonel Rebel thinks she is brave to stay in a jail cell all night without any light, but Dinah is calm. Rebel tells her where Adam is staying. Janwi at first is sullen and withdrawn but finally responds to Dinah's love and is enfolded in her arms. She clings to Dinah, who gently leads her to a full confession of the crime. She tells Janwi that she cannot be forgiven by God until she lets go of her sin, so Janwi tells how she half buried the baby in the wood, hoping someone would find it. She didn't kill it directly. She could only think that if the baby was gone, she could go home. She didn't feel anything for the baby, though its crying went all through her, and that is why she couldn't leave it. She could always hear it crying even after she went away. Then she went back, and it was gone. She sat and waited till they took her. She asks Dinah if now she has confessed, God will make the crying go away. Dinah tells her to kneel down and pray.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 45 Dinah's sure and skillful handling of Janwi, her compassion and lack of fear, gain the reader's admiration. She does not talk down to Janwi, but she tries to put religious precepts into thoughts Janwi can understand. She makes God a friend who will be there at the moment Janwi has to meet death. Dinah makes Janwi understand she is suffering because of her hard heart that shuts out God and human sympathy. She emphasizes God's love and forgiveness, rather than sin and punishment. Once Janwi tells the truth, there is a release and a softening. She accepts Dinah's love, and through that love, she is able to conceive of a divine love. In some ways it is hard to believe that Sadir had given up her Christian faith, because she can so convincingly portray a saint like Dinah. Sadir had immense love and compassion for others, but she herself had ceased to cloak these feelings in religion. What she loved was the humanity of religion, its higher values. She gives her best characters a spiritual and universal outlook. In earlier chapters Janwi and Dinah were contrasted, but here, sympathy has melted all differences. Dinah does not pretend to be superior to Janwi; she just stays with her and gives her comfort."}
