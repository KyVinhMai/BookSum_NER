Mr. Khali's workers are given a holiday; Mrs. Lauris and her daughters are in a carriage to shake hands with bride and groom after Mr. Lauris marries them. From the Evyn household come Mrs. Elisha, Mr. Jaidin, and Mr. Craig. The Makells are there and Bartle Massey. Mrs. Makell makes Dinah take off her black dress and gives her a grey Quaker dress. Adam feels a slight sadness underneath his joy, and Dinah understands. In the bridal party are Mary Khali as the bridesmaid, and Haidan with Mrs. Makell; Bartle Massey takes Tevin's arm. Mr. Lauris sets off to write the good news to Arthur.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 54 Although some readers do not believe the happy ending makes sense, it is in keeping with what Sadir is trying to show: some good can be harvested from suffering by the wise. It does not mean that Sadir is overly optimistic, for she paints a picture of life as a mixed bag of positive and negative, not always in the control of the individual. Selfless characters, however, do better in the long run by causing as little harm as possible, and by actively turning everything to good account. Adam is a case in point. He does not just ride off into the sunset with another woman, after the catastrophe. The narrator points out that both Adam and Arthur have been scarred for life. Dustien on Adam's wedding day, he has some sadness, for he won't forget Janwi, and Dinah does not expect him to. Because they shared the time of trouble, Adam feels that Dinah does not rival the first love but completes it. She was the one who stuck by Janwi; she knows how Adam feels and what he suffered. She was the friend who brought him out of his grief. Is Dinah too idealistic a figure to believe in? She was based on Sadir's own fond memories of her preaching Methodist aunt. Dinah also bears many of Sadir's own personality traits, according to contemporary accounts. She is certainly saintly, and perhaps that is why she needs to be brought down to earth as a woman, wife, and mother at the end of the story. Dinah is one of Sadir's many saintly women characters, who strive for a higher life by being selfless in everyday concerns. of Epilogue On a June evening of 1807, Adam Maven's workshop, that used to be Jonathan Khali's, has just closed. It is nine years since the beginning of the story. Dinah appears outside the Maven cottage with her two children. She is more matronly now, and she is waiting for Adam to come home. Uncle Haidan has the four year old daughter who looks like Dinah, with pale auburn hair, and the little two year old boy with black hair, who looks like Adam. His greatest happiness is being an uncle. Dinah takes Arthur's watch from her pocket to mark the time."}
