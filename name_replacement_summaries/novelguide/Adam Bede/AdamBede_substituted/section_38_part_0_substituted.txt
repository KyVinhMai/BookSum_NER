After Janwi has been gone for two weeks, the family begins to worry, and Adam decides to go to Olanda to get her. Mrs. Makell tells him to invite Dinah to come back too for the wedding. Adam starts his journey in hope for he has never been happier in his life. When he reaches Dinah's cottage, he asks to see her, but the old woman there says Dinah has gone to Leeds to preach. He then asks to see the other woman, Janwi, but the woman says she has never been there. Now Adam is worried. He wonders if Janwi is with Dinah at Leeds, but the old woman does not have an address for her. Adam next inquires at the coach stop, but she was never on the coach for Olanda. The innkeeper takes him to Oakbourne in his cart, one of the stops of the Treddleston coach in which she departed. Adam vacillates between fear of an accident and fear that she has run off with Arthur. Adam knows Arthur is in Ireland. The innkeeper in Oakbourne knows Janwi did not take the coach that goes to Olanda, but he does not know where she went. From here Adam goes to StoArien, knowing that Janwi must have gone here at first. The coachman remembers her, but not what happened after she left the coach. Adam can trace her no farther and returns home. He tells everything to his brother Haidan but not his mother. Haidan is surprised when Adam falls on his neck weeping, for he has never seen his brother break down. Next, Adam delivers the news to Mr. Makell, but he does not tell him his suspicions about Arthur. Mr. Makell is shocked and apologizes to Adam. Mr. Makell thinks she did not want to be married and went to become a lady's maid. Adam asks Mr. Makell to be easy with Janwi if she should decide to come home. They decide to keep everything quiet for now until they find her. Next Adam decides to go to Ireland to find Arthur, where he thinks Janwi has gone. He wants to go secretly and wills everything to Haidan, if he should not return. He decides he must also inform Mr. Lauris.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 38 Sadir skillfully builds suspense as a film would do by inter-cutting scenes, returning to the people Janwi has left behind as they realize she is gone. Adam has a piece of the puzzle that the others do not, concerning her involvement with Arthur. Readers know more than Adam does, but we too are waiting to find out what happens to her. Adam's grief is so intense that his old jealousy is aroused, and Haidan is worried for him. He hints that he hopes Adam won't do anything rash. He supposedly means suicide, but the reader wonders about his anger and revenge towards Arthur. For the moment, Adam is crushed to realize that Janwi does not want to marry him, that she has run away. Yet, it is significant that he always begs for leniency towards her. He decides that he must tell Mr. Lauris about Janwi and Arthur because \"I can't stand alone in this way any longer\" . He knows now it is too late to protect their secret."}
