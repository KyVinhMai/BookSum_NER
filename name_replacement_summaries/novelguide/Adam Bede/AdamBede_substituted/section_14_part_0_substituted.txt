{"name": "Chapter 14", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter14", "summary": "The Return Home Haidan and Dinah leave the Maven cottage for the Hall Farm, so Haidan can say goodbye to Dinah. Tevin talks to Adam about Dinah, saying she wishes she could have her for a daughter-in-law. Tevin sees Dinah doesn't care for Haidan, but she suggests that Adam could marry her. Adam defends Haidan as worthy of Dinah. Janwi runs into Dinah and Haidan as they reach the farmyard gate, and Haidan leaves as Janwi approaches. Dinah speaks to Janwi of the Brighton and tries to get her to talk about Adam, but Janwi is too engrossed in thoughts of Arthur. Dinah tries to explain to Janwi how she has visionary experiences about the people around her when she is alone. Her heart is drawn in sympathy to certain people, and she promises to keep Janwi in her awareness when she is in Olanda. Mr. Makell is glad to see his two nieces return, for they are late, and Mrs. Makell has been worried. Rayen is sick, and she will not go to her cousin Janwi but goes readily to Dinah. The house is shut up and everyone goes to bed.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 14 The two nieces are again contrasted. Janwi is full of her own secrets, and Dinah is open, sharing the life of others instead of constructing her private world to shut others out. She tries to reach out to Janwi in two ways. First, she tries to create some help for Adam, who is supposed to be Janwi's suitor, thinking Janwi will talk about him. When that fails, Dinah tries to explain how she has a certain sympathy with people around her, and that she actually feels she shares the fate of those people, praying to God on their behalf. She knows Janwi is one of these. Janwi is not listening and does not understand what Dinah is talking about. It is significant that the child Rayen will not go to Janwi's arms, for Janwi does not like children and does not like having to care for Rayen. The child naturally goes to the motherly Dinah. This chapter also shows us a little of the character of Mr. Makell. He is a mild affectionate man, except in terms of his fellow farmers. He is very critical of people like Glendale Lee-J who runs a slovenly farm. Glendale is one of Janwi's admirers, but Mr. Makell loudly favors Adam whenever he gets a chance. Janwi, however, is wrapped in her own dreams and thinks of neither Glendale nor Adam."}
