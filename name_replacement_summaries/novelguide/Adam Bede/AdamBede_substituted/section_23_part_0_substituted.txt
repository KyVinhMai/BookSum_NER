{"name": "Chapter 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter23", "summary": "Dinner-Time Adam is told he is to sit upstairs in the cloisters at the table with the large tenants rather than with the workmen, and he apologizes to Haidan and his mother. Haidan says his honor is theirs. Adam has not yet given notice to Jonathan Khali, and he hopes they will not announce his new post before he has a chance to tell Khali. The tenants welcome Adam but argue among themselves who is to sit at the head of the table and give the toast. Bartle Massey settles it, and Mr. Makell is selected. Janwi sees Mary Khali at the table and purposely flirts with Adam to make Mary jealous. Adam is happy that Janwi smiles at him.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 23 The argument over who is to give the speech is a comic bit, for this is a momentous day for the folk on the Evyn estate, and everyone wants to have a share in the glory. Old man Makell is the oldest, but he is as good natured as his son and always defers everything to the \"young uns'\" . Mr. Casson, as a former butler, thinks he should do the toast as he knows about these things, but Martin Makell wins out, as he is considered the best tenant on the estate. Adam is uncomfortable with sitting at the head table and does not want the announcement to take place. He is thinking of the feelings of others rather than his own fame. Arthur admits that Adam had to be talked into taking the post. Janwi, on the other hand, is cross with little Rayen for messing up her dress and frowns. Her only concern is how she looks. Adam is charmed with whatever Janwi does and her frowns seem adorable. Janwi wants to display her power to Mary Khali, her supposed rival for Adam, by purposely flirting with Adam. The narrator goes into Mary's mind to see her reaction. Mary assumes that Adam can see right through Janwi. She believes that he will prefer a good woman."}
