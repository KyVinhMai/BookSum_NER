{"name": "Chapter 51", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter51", "summary": "Sunday Morning Dinah is questioned by Tevin about her leaving. Tevin complains that she hasn't long to live and will never see Dinah again. Then she launches into a topic embarrassing to Dinah: a husband. Tevin admits Haidan is not the right husband, but asks her what she thinks of Adam? He would be a proper husband. Dinah escapes as soon as she can for the Hall Farm. When Haidan comes in, Tevin says to him that Dinah would stay if Adam would marry her. Haidan is surprised and asks Tevin if Dinah has said so. Tevin says it is written all over her. Sunday mornings are the happiest for Tevin, because Adam stays home and reads his Bible in the same room with her. She makes up her mind to speak to Adam about Dinah, but doesn't know how to begin. When she sees in Adam's Bible the picture of the angel on Christ's tomb, she blurts out, \"That's her--that's Dinah\" . Tevin uses this to start the conversation where she tells Adam he should marry Dinah; they were meant for each other, and Dinah loves him. He is struck by this idea and feels \"a resurrection of his dead joy\" . He decides to talk to Haidan about it since he was the one who wanted to marry Dinah. Haidan is unselfish and says he will not stand in the way, but he is sure Dinah doesn't want to marry because of her calling.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 51 Tevin has been a secondary character, but here she takes a part in shaping the outcome of the story. Though she is afraid of displeasing Adam, she sees right through Dinah's feelings, and she decides to take a chance to tell Adam about it. She, like Mrs. Makell, does not want to part with Dinah, and has always dreamed of having her for a daughter-in-law. She is very particular whom she will let in the house, not even allowing a hired servant. Dinah is Tevin's own best insurance for a happy old age, but more than that, finally she has grown to the point where she wants happiness for her son. Opposed to her sons' marriage in the beginning, she knows she hasn't long to live, and wants to see Adam settled with a good wife. The narrator mentions that the tragedy had affected her too, that it had quieted down her selfish demands. For once, Adam listens to his mother because she is wise in this matter. His sudden conversion from being blind to love to completely open to the suggestion may strain the belief of some, but it is not uncommon in grief to be unable to imagine loving again. He was so used to Dinah as a sister that the other suggestion never directly entered his mind. Adam is a man of action, however, and does not waste time as soon as he gets the point. Haidan may seem too good to be true as the completely unselfish brother without the slightest trace of jealousy, but it is in keeping with his character and religion. He has made it plain he would like to be around Dinah in any way possible."}
