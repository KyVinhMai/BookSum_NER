{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter22", "summary": "Going to the Birthday Feast In the hot pause of July when nature is lazy, the great cask of ale brewed on Arthur Evyn's birth is opened for his coming of age. All the people from Hayslope and Evann are gathering at the Chase for dinner and games and a dance. Janwi has bought a few bits of finery for the occasion, but secretly tries on the pearl and garnet earrings Arthur recently gave her. She has to keep them hidden. She does put on the locket he gave her with strands of their hair intertwined inside. It cannot be seen under her dress. The whole Makell family departs in a cart and arrives at the Evyn house, built on to the remnant of an abbey. Arthur roams around greeting people with Mr. Lauris, informing him that his grandfather has given in to hiring Adam to manage the woods. Arthur wants to announce it at the dinner. Lauris teases him about wanting the announcement to make him look good with the tenants, and Arthur blushes.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 22 The focus is on the vanity of both Janwi and Arthur. Janwi is more in love with the earrings than with Arthur, the narrator tells us. She also continues to sound warnings about Janwi's coming tragedy. Janwi is not only vain; she is jealous as well, imagining Mary Khali as a rival. Mary will have all new clothes, and Janwi has to wear some old things. But she imagines the clothes she will have as Arthur's wife. Arthur similarly is indulging in his dream of being the great landowner in the future and begins by planning the announcement of Adam as manager of the Chase woods. This, he believes, will make him popular with the people and make them look forward to his becoming the squire."}
