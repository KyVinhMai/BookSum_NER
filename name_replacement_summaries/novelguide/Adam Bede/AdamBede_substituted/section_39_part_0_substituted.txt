{"name": "Chapter 39", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter39", "summary": "The Tidings When Arthur arrives at the parsonage, he is kept waiting as Mr. Lauris talks to a strange man . When Adam is admitted, he tells Mr. Lauris that he has come to him for help because he looks up to him the most and must tell him some painful news. Mr. Lauris is looking at Adam strangely and has his hand on a letter. Adam tells him Janwi has run away and that he is going to look for her. Mr. Lauris asks if Adam knows why she ran away. Adam says there is someone else involved. Mr. Lauris looks relieved. Adam then tells him the other person is Arthur, and Mr. Lauris is shocked and full of grief as Adam tells about the secret meetings and how he made Arthur write the letter to Janwi. Mr. Lauris then tells Adam to prepare himself for a heavy blow. He can at least thank God he is not the guilty one. He shows Adam the letter from a magistrate in StoArien with news of Janwi. She has been arrested for killing her baby. Adam is stricken, saying Janwi never had a child. The letter mentions that she denies having a baby, but there is evidence. Mr. Lauris says they can only hope she didn't do it. The trial is coming soon. Adam says he forgives Janwi, but he will bring Arthur back to see Janwi's misery; it is all his fault. Arthur, however, is on his way home already because his grandfather has sent for him. Mr. Lauris switches Adam's attention to Janwi and advises him to go to StoArien with him to identify Janwi. He tells Adam there are others to think of in this crisis.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 39 Sadir shocks the characters and readers at the same time by skillfully postponing the outcome of Janwi's tortured journey until we hear this official report reach her family and friends. Sadir further delays telling the details and final scenes of Janwi's story until the trial. Adam's blow is hard to witness, for he has tried so hard and was so close, he thought, to happiness: \"O God, it's too hard to lay upon me--it's too to hard to think she is wicked\" . Mr. Lauris comes into his own as the moral leader in this crisis. It is clear that he first thought Adam was the father of the baby. Relieved at first when Adam says it was someone else, he is doubly hurt to find the man is Arthur. He remembers Arthur trying to confess something to him. Though crushed himself for his protege and surrogate son, Mr. Lauris thinks of others and how to soften the blow so that the right things can be done. Adam claims that Arthur is to blame and should suffer the consequences, not Janwi. He continues to load all the guilt on Arthur. Mr. Lauris counsels Adam wisely against revenge, and tells him that Arthur's suffering will be worse, since he caused the tragedy. He must put his attention on giving help. Knowing everyone's nature, Mr. Lauris begins skillfully to orchestrate the community response, fulfilling his office of spiritual counselor admirably. He gives Adam some action to do--come with him to StoArien Prison."}
