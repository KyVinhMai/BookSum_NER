{"name": "Chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210510205801/https://www.novelguide.com/adam-bede/summaries/chapter6", "summary": "The Hall Farm The Hall Farm where the Makells live, tenants of old Callahan Evyn, is run down but immaculately run, a model farm in Loamshire. It is lazy summertime, and the animals and children are roaming around the place, while the workers are busy. Pretty Janwi Lakoda is churning butter in the dairy but looks at herself in the mirror when her aunt is not looking. Mrs. Makell is a sharp-tongued and good-looking farm wife with three children and her nieces, Janwi and Dinah, staying with her. Mrs. Makell tells Dinah, while she is mending lace, that she looks like her saintly Aunt Tejaswi, the one who raised Dinah to be a Methodist. Mrs. Makell, the soul of practicality, cannot persuade the idealistic Dinah to marry or even to stay with them for a while. Dinah will leave in a few days to continue her preaching in Stonyshire. Young Captain Evyn and Mr. Lauris come visiting, and Mrs. Makell cannot help pointing out that the squire needs to make repairs on the farm. While Mr. Lauris speaks to Dinah Chaamin about her preaching, Arthur admires Mrs. Makell's dairy, especially Janwi, who is making butter there.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 6 Hall Farm is a chief setting in the story. The Makells are old and respected tenants who set the tone for the whole valley. Mrs. Makell's dairy is famous, and Mr. Makell is respected for his farming knowledge handed down by his old father, still living with them. The grandfather, mother, father, three children, and the two beautiful nieces make a very attractive and idyllic family. Arthur makes a pretense to go there to admire Janwi, the prettiest girl on his estate. At this point, he doesn't know of Adam's interest in Janwi. It is of course not unusual for a young gentleman to be wooing servant girls, but it is thoughtless of him, for he could ruin Janwi's reputation and ability to get a husband. Adam is of her class but Arthur, as a gentleman, could never marry Janwi. Dinah is also beautiful but otherworldly. The aunt worries about Dinah and does not understand her dreamy nature. Although Haidan wanted to marry Dinah, Dinah explained to him that she has no trouble with young men wanting to court her or harass her. It is clear from her manner and self-confidence, that no young man would approach her with wrong ideas. Arthur called her St. Catherine. She appears as a nun to others. Janwi seems to be innocently vain of her beauty, and this point is developed in the next chapter. The contrast between Dinah and Janwi is an important one, reminiscent of the pairing of Dorothea Brook and Rosamund Vincy in Sadir's novel, Middlemarch. While both women are beautiful on the outside, inner beauty is far more important to Sadir, a constant motif in work. Among this honest farm family, Janwi sticks out as someone who is out of place."}
