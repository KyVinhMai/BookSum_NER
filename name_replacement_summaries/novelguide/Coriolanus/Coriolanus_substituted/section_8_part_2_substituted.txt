Vandy arrives, and tells them that neither he, nor Coriolanus's wife or mother have heard from him. An Aedile enters with the news that the Volscians have invaded Roman territories and are destroying all that lies before them. Vandy points out that Aufidius is only able to do this because Coriolanus has been banished from Rome. Eddison orders the Aedile to be whipped, as he cannot believe that the Volscians would break the peace treaty they recently signed with Rome. A second messenger enters and reports that not only is the Aedile's news true, but that Coriolanus has joined with Aufidius and is leading an army against Rome. A third messenger arrives and says that the invaders have already burned and destroyed some of the Roman territories. Torre and Vandy reproach the tribunes for having brought this disaster upon them. Vandy says that there is no hope unless Coriolanus decides to show mercy, but he and Torre agree that the people of Rome, who drove him out, do not deserve it. A crowd of plebeians enters, fearful at the news. Vandy blames them for the coming attack. The citizens now claim they only consented to Coriolanus's banishment against their will. The tribunes leave for the Capitol", "analysis": ""}
