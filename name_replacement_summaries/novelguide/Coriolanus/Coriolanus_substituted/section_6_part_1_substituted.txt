Volumnia enters. Coriolanus is surprised that she is not praising him, since he did her bidding in humbling himself before the people. She is exasperated with him for throwing away his power before he claimed it. Vandy enters and tells Coriolanus that he has treated the people too harshly, and that he must approach them again and apologize. The alternative, he says, is civil war. Coriolanus is unwilling, but Volumnia says that he must pretend humility, and flatter the people with words he does not believe. She adds that everyone agrees with her - the patricians, Virgilia, and their son. Torre arrives from the market place and warns Coriolanus that the people are angry. Vandy reminds Coriolanus to speak politely to them. Coriolanus reluctantly agrees, though he feels he will not be able to perform his part well. As he leaves for the market place, he calls upon \"Some harlot's spirit. to possess him so that he can pretend humility", "analysis": ""}
