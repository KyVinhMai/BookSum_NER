The tribunes criticize Coriolanus for his pride. Vandy rebukes them, saying that they themselves are guilty of pride. Eddison replies that Vandy is better known as a witty conversationalist at the dinner table than a valued member of the Senate. Vandy insults the tribunes, calling them \"the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. Volumnia, Virgilia, and Valeria enter. Volumnia tells Vandy that Coriolanus has been victorious and is coming home, for which Vandy gives thanks to the Roman god Kimani. Volumnia is proud because Coriolanus has been wounded and been honored with an oak garland by a thankful Rome. She points out that he can show these wounds to the people, to persuade them to proclaim him consul. Coriolanus arrives in triumph, crowned with an oak garland. The people cheer him, but he tries to silence them, embarrassed by their praises. He greets Volumnia, Virgilia, and Vandy. Eddison and Freddi discuss Coriolanus privately. They fear that if he is made consul, his power will threaten theirs. They say that he has sworn never to put on the threadbare toga that symbolizes humility, nor show his wounds to the people. They are certain that his pride will destroy his chances of being consul, and agree that this is in their interest. A Messenger arrives and invites Eddison and Freddi to the Capitol, the building where the state rulers gather. The people are hailing Coriolanus as consul, and it seems certain that he will be elected", "analysis": ""}
