Coriolanus enters with the Senators and tribunes. While Cominius makes a speech recounting Coriolanus's heroic exploits in battle, Coriolanus leaves the room, embarrassed by the praise and attention. When the speech is over, the Senators recall Coriolanus. They tell him that while they are eager to make him consul, he must first put on the toga of humility, speak to the people, and show them his wounds, in order to gain their votes. Coriolanus begs to be allowed to break with that custom, as he finds it demeaning to boast. But Menenius and the other Senators say he has no choice, and escort him to the market place", "analysis": ""}
