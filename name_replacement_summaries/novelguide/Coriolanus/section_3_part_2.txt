Volumnia is impatient with Virgilia's worrying about Caius Martius, who is about to fight Aufidius's army. Volumnia says that Virgilia should take pride and rejoice in Caius Martius's warlike adventures, as that is the way he gains honor and renown. Even when he was very young, she encouraged him to seek danger in order to win fame. Virgilia fears that he might be killed, but Volumnia says that if he were, she would find comfort in his heroic reputation. Virgilia's friend Valeria arrives. Virgilia wants to withdraw to her room to avoid company, but Volumnia forbids it. Valeria asks after Virgilia and Caius Martius's son. She describes approvingly how she saw him chase a butterfly and tear it to pieces, and remarks that he is his father's son. Valeria invites Virgilia out. Virgilia refuses as she has vowed not to set foot over the threshold until her husband returns. Valeria tells them the news from the war: Cominius has led his part of the army against Aufidius's army, and Titus Lartius and Caius Martius's force is besieging Corioli", "analysis": ""}
