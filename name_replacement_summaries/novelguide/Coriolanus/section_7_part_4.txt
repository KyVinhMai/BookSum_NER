He tells the audience that he intends to ally himself with Aufidius against his native city and become Rome's enemy.", "analysis": "The exchange between Adrian and Nicanor both shows the deceptiveness of a society where little is what it seems. It also prepares the audience for the coming attack by Aufidius on Rome, and makes clear that this time the odds are very different. The last battle was won for Rome almost single-handedly by Coriolanus, and this time he will not be there. The next scene heightens the tension by showing Coriolanus's intention to ally himself with Aufidius, his former foe. Coriolanus's tragic decline continues, as he turns his back on all that is dear to him. his homeland, mother, wife, son, and friends. and becomes Rome's bitterest enemy. His inward transformation is symbolized by his change of garments; he is disguised \"in mean apparel,. signifying a departure from his true self. Coriolanus's soliloquy in Act IV, scene iv draws attention to the \"slippery turns. or fickle changes of the world. This is a major theme of the play. The plebeians showed fickleness in changing their minds about supporting Coriolanus, and now Coriolanus is enacting revenge by deliberately fickle behavior. making friends with his former enemy and attacking the homeland that he previously risked his life for. His description of bosom friends who fall out and become bitter enemies both describes recent events in his life and foreshadows the twists and reverses that will mark his relationship with Aufidius from this point on"}
