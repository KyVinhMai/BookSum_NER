Cominius and Titus Lartius begin to praise Caius Martius, who is largely responsible for the Roman victories at Corioli and in the battlefield, but he stops them. Cominius offers Caius Martius a tenth of the spoils of battle, but Caius Martius refuses, insisting that he only take an equal share of the spoils with all the soldiers who fought. The soldiers cheer Caius Martius. Caius Martius asks them all to cease praising him, saying that flattery has no place on the battlefield, and that he has done no more than many others have done without recognition. Cominius presents his horse to Caius Martius, and gives him a new addition to his name in honor of his victory: he will be known as Caius Martius Coriolanus, after the city he conquered. Caius Martius asks Cominius to free a poor Volscian man who gave him hospitality in Corioli and who was taken prisoner. Cominius readily agrees, but Caius Martius cannot remember the man's name", "analysis": ""}
