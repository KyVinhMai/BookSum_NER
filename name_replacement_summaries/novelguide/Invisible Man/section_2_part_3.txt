The protagonist seeks out Dr. Bledsoe who had been worried and was awaiting their arrival. Once Bledsoe learns that the protagonist has taken Norton to the slave quarters and beyond, he is upset but manages to mask his anger fairly well while in Mr. Norton's presence. Norton attempts to explain that it is not the boy's fault, but Bledsoe does not respond positively to these words. The boy is sent away to his dormitory room. Later in the day, Dr. Bledsoe sends for the protagonist in order to discuss the matter further. On his way to Dr. Bledsoe's office, the protagonist stops by Mr. Norton's to speak to him once again. There, the protagonist learns that Norton will be leaving that same night and that the protagonist needs to speak to Dr. Bledsoe immediately.", "analysis": ". These chapters demonstrate the ways in which whites who support the college are unaware of the true realities of African American life not just at the college but for those who reside in the community where the college is set. Mr. Norton's reaction to all that he has learned has negative implications for the protagonist. We can also see the protagonist functioning in a very naeve manner and this has endangered his enrollment at the college and causes him to dismiss the veteran's words"}
