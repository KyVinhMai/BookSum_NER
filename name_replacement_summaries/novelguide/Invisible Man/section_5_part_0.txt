The protagonist is sent to work for Kimbro who is very aggressive and yells at his subordinates. Kimbro explains that his job will be to put the dope required for the paint into each bucket. He must place exactly ten drops of black liquid into each bucket in order to produce the optic white color. Kimbro boasts that the optic white is the whitest white and is so good that it is the brand used on government buildings. When they run out of dope, Kimbro instructs the narrator get more from the tack room, but the protagonist gets the wrong thing and ruins a few batches of paint. Kimbro is very upset and eventually dismisses the protagonist. . However, the protagonist is not fired. He is reassigned to work with Lucius Brockaway, a long-time black employee in the basement. Brockaway boasts that he is an irreplaceable part of the company and that no one has \"the touch\" that he has when it comes to making paint.

The protagonist returns upstairs to retrieve his lunch from the area that he was originally assigned. Attempting to get his lunch, he walks in on a union meeting and is accused of being a fink, particularly because he works for Lucius Brockaway, an enemy of the union.

If he proves to not be a trouble maker, he will be allowed membership. When he returns, he is questioned by Brockaway as to why he was gone for so long. The protagonist truthfully responds that he had walked in on a union meeting, and Brockaway flies into anger. The protagonist and Brockaway fight until Brockaway bites him viciously and loses his teeth in the process. Brockaway apologizes and explains that he feels threatened by the union and sees their presence as treachery. During this time, the mixture is overheating and they struggle to turn the gauges down.
