Full of determination and love for her husband, she resolves to convince Macbeth to carry through with the planned murders. She says that Macbeth is too kind and gentle to commit such an act, whereas she is more morally courageous and daring. Lady Macbeth is interrupted by a messenger who tells her that Macbeth and King Duncan will be arriving at Inverness, their castle, in a few moments. Momentarily aghast, Lady Macbeth realizes that this is her chance to kill Duncan. She prays for confidence and unwavering resolve so that she can carry through with her evil intentions. When Macbeth enters, she orders him to appear to be hospitable, servile and kind to the king, as she does not want anyone to suspect them of their plans. She tells Macbeth to put his mind to rest, as she will orchestrate the whole murder", "analysis": ""}
