He wishes that Duncan's murder were an end in itself, tying up all loose ends with the result of sovereignty. Macbeth also wonders whether the crime is worth all of his effort; for a few moments of mortal pleasure, he may be condemned to eternal damnation in Hell. In addition, he tells himself that the crime will be even more ghastly because Macbeth is Duncan's kinsman, subject and host. It is the assumed duty of the host to protect his guests, not kill them. Furthermore, Macbeth says that Duncan's virtuous nature will make his murder seem all the more brutal. Lady Macbeth enters the room and asks Macbeth why he is not dining with Duncan. Macbeth tells his wife that he does not want to proceed with their plans. She furiously asks Macbeth why he is so afraid to be the same in action as he is in desire. In addition, she declares him a sickly coward. She assures her husband that they will not fail in their mission. Lady Macbeth explains that they will poison King Duncan and his servants' wine with sleeping pills and that Macbeth will murder Duncan in his sleep. Finally convinced by his wife, he agrees to carry through with the plans with the semblance of an amicable host", "analysis": ""}
