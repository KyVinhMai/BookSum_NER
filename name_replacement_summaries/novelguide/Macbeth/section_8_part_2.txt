Macbeth enters and asks to speak to the witches' masters about the future. An apparition takes the form of a helmeted head and tells Macbeth to beware the Thane of Fife. A second specter appears in the form of a bloody child. It tells Macbeth to be brave because \"none of woman born\" can kill him. Then, a third spirit emerges in the form of a crowned child with a tree in its hand. It tells Macbeth that he shall never be vanquished until the Great Birnam Wood travels to high Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth becomes relieved, because he laughs at the idea of trees moving. As a final question, Macbeth asks the witches if Banquo's sons will ever reign in Scotland. Eight ghosts with crowns emerge, who represent the future sons of Banquo. Banquo himself appears at the end of the line with a mirror, thus implying an infinite number of descendants. Stupefied, Macbeth cannot believe his eyes and is angered to realize that despite all of his work, he wears a \"fruitless crown. The witches disappear and Lennox enters the haunt. He informs Macbeth that Macduff has run off to England. Macbeth decides that he must act out all of his thoughts and impulses. He determines to kill Macduff's wife and children as his first step of revenge", "analysis": ""}
