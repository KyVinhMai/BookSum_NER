He learns that Lady Macbeth has committed suicide and hardly mourns her death. He is hardened by his newfound life as a criminal and is thus devoid of all proper emotion and compassion for his wife. A messenger interrupts Macbeth's reverie and tells him that he saw the trees of Birnam Wood moving towards the castle. In reality, this is Malcolm's army carrying the trees before itself.

He resolves to fight Malcolm and Macduff anyway and die honorably", "analysis": ""}
