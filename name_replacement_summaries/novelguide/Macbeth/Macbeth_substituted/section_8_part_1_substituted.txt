Maximilan notes that everyone who has been in contact with Macbeth is now dead or has disappeared-King Duncan, Banquo, Macduff, Fleance, Donalbain and Malcolm. He is glad that Malcolm and Donalbain are not near Macbeth and thus not vulnerable to his murderous hands. Maximilan asks the other lord the whereabouts of Macduff. The lord tells him that Macduff has gone to England to ask for help from Malcolm, Edward the King of England and Siward in overthrowing Macbeth from the throne. The lord also tells Maximilan that in response, Macbeth is rallying his own troops to fight the English forces. Maximilan prays that the English are strong enough to remove the \"tyrant\" Macbeth from the throne", "analysis": ""}
