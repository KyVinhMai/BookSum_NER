{"name": "act 1, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212063205/https://www.novelguide.com/macbeth/summaries/act1-scene3-act1-scene4", "summary": "At the palace, King Duncan asks Malcolm if the Thane of Cawdor's execution has taken place. Malcolm tells him that the nobleman repented his actions. In response, Duncan says that there is no way of determining a person's thoughts, whether good or evil, in the physiognomy of the face. The king says that the Thane of Cawdor betrayed him although he had absolutely trusted him. This is ironic because in the same way Macbeth plots to kill Duncan albeit with a sweet and servile countenance. At this point, Macbeth enters and Duncan laments that he can never amply recompense him for all of his work. Macbeth replies that his work for the king is a reward in itself. The king also highly praises Banquo. Then, in front of the entire assembly, King Duncan proclaims his son Malcolm to be his heir to the crown. Macbeth asks to take leave of the king so that he can write a letter to his wife telling her about the turn of events in the castle. He also determines that he must kill Duncan and Malcolm if he wants to be king; in the space of a scene, his mind is firmly resolved to commit the crime", "analysis": ""}
