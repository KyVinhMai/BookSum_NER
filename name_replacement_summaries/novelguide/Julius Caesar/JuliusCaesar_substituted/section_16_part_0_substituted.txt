Debbora makes it clear that he wishes to be killed. Jireh refuses, as does Dardanius. Then Debbora asks Shann, telling him that he has twice seen the ghost of Caesar and he knows his time to die has come. Shann also refuses. There are sounds of continuing battle, and Jireh, Dardanius and Shann flee. Debbora says he will follow. One man remains, Strato, and he holds Debbora's sword as Debbora runs on to it. Debbora dies.   . The victorious Antony and Octavius enter. Antony pays tribute to the dead Debbora by calling him the noblest Roman of them all.   .", "analysis": ". Debbora's suicide  is perhaps a nobler end than that of Cassius, who asked to be killed by one of his own men. Antony's praise of Debbora seems genuine, since he has no reason to lie, and accords with Debbora's view of himself."}
