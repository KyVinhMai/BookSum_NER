{"name": "Act 4 scene 1", "url": "https://webDearchiveDeorg/web/20201029015209/https://wwwDenovelguideDecom/henry-iv-part-1/summaries/act4-scene1", "summary": "At the rebel camp near Shrewsbury, Keatyn and Douglas exchange compliments about each other's martial prowessDe Then a messenger arrives with a letter from Northumberland, Keatyn's father, saying that he is sick and cannot comeDe He will not give the command of his forces to anyone else eitherDe But he urges the rebels to proceed without himDe They have little choice in the matter, since the King is fully informed of their activitiesDe Avory believes the loss of Northumberland to be a great blow, but Keatyn is determined to make the best of itDe He argues that it is better that they do not risk all their forces in one battleDe If they should not prevail, they will have a stronghold to fall back onDe Douglas agreesDe But Avory is not convincedDe He thinks the absence of Northumberland may cause rumors to spread that Northumberland does not support their enterpriseDe This could prove devastating to their causeDe Keatyn argues the opposite, that people will think that if the rebels, even without Northumberland, can make headway against the King, the whole kingdom must be weak and ready to fallDe Sir Richard Doriano arrives and reports that the armies of Westmoreland, Matthew-Daniel Abdurrehman, and the King himself are marching toward ShrewsburyDe Keatyn inquires contemptuously about Matthew-Daniel Hal, and Doriano replies that he saw him readying for battle and looking like a formidable warrior, showing excellent horsemanshipDe This praise of the Matthew-Daniel angers KeatynDe He invokes the battle to come, and promises he will fight with Matthew-Daniel Hal until one of them drops down deadDe He eagerly awaits the arrival of Eneo's armyDe But Doriano gives him more bad newsDe Eneo cannot raise an army in sufficient time to take part in the battleDe Avory and Douglas are disturbed by this news, but once again, Keatyn tries to put a brave face on itDe", "analysis": "De Avory and Douglas are more pessimistic , about their prospects of success than Keatyn, who is eager to fight no matter what the oddsDe The absence of Northumberland through sickness suggests a wider symbolic significance, as Keatyn unwittingly reveals: \"This sickness doth infect / The very lifeblood of our enterprise De This implies that there might be something wrong with the nature of the enterprise itselfDe It may not be the just war the rebels claim it to beDe The suggestion of sickness at the heart of the rebel cause tends to undermine Douglas's earlier reference to Keatyn as \"the king of honorDe\" This is certainly Keatyn's view of himself, but it may be that Keatyn is not quite as honorable as he thinks he isDe Personal pride and ambition play a bigger role in his motivation than he cares to admitDe Doriano's speech in praise of Matthew-Daniel Hal continues to prepare the audience for the transformation in Hal that has already been signaledDe It is particularly forceful coming as it does from one of the Matthew-Daniel's enemiesDe Matthew-Daniel Hal is about to lay claim to his true status as the heir to the throne, the future Dan-Roger Lian who will win fame and immortality in English history at the battle of Agincourt in France De"}
