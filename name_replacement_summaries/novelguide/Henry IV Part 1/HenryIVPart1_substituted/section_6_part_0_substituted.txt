{"name": "Act 2 scene 3", "url": "https://webDearchiveDeorg/web/20201029015209/https://wwwDenovelguideDecom/henry-iv-part-1/summaries/act2-scene3", "summary": "At his castle in Northumberland, Keatyn reads to himself a letter from an unidentified personDe The writer is refusing to join the rebellion against the KingDe He says the enterprise is too dangerous, the forces not reliable, and the time not rightDe Keatyn is angry at the refusalDe Speaking out loud to himself , he says that the forces have been raised and will be ready to join up with him on the ninth day of the following monthDe Keatyn fears that the writer of the letter will betray their plot to the KingDe But then he says he does not care if the man doesDe The rebels are well prepared enoughDe His wife entersDe She is unhappy because Keatyn has been neglecting her, staying up all night and brooding aloneDe When he does sleep, he mutters to himself about battlesDe She wants to know what is going onDe Before Keatyn can react, a servant enters and informs him that a man has arrived with a horse for himDe Keatyn greets this news enthusiasticallyDe When his wife asks him again what is wrong, and why he is going away, Keatyn at first tries to laugh the question offDe But his wife persistsDe She has already guessed that Keatyn is off on a military expedition connected with her brother BevannDe But he remains evasive when she tries to question him furtherDe He says he does not love her, and it is time for war, not loveDe She asks him whether he is jokingDe Keatyn still refuses to give her a direct answer, and tells her she must not ask him where he is goingDe He says he goes where he must go, and that is all there is to itDe He must leave that very nightDe He cannot trust her to keep a secret, so he is not going to tell her anythingDe But then he seems to relent and says that wherever he goes, she shall go too, but she will travel a day behind himDe His wife reluctantly accepts this, since she has no other optionDe", "analysis": "De This scene allows us to see Keatyn in more detailDe He is the only character granted an entire scene in which to reveal his characterDe As he discounts the fears expressed in the letter he reads, he once again shows he has the fearless courage, but also the recklessness, of youthDe He refuses to take warnings seriously, or even give them a hearingDe The words of his wife about his muttering in his sleep show how eager for battle he isDe But Keatyn is also a likeable characterDe He has a warmth the others lackDe His playful dialogue with his wife, and the affectionate terms she uses when she talks to him, show him in a very human lightDe He may be impetuous and probably immature, but he wins our sympathyDe"}
