Bevann never fought with EneoDe The King tells Keatyn not to mention Bevann again and demands that Keatyn send him his prisoners with all speedDe He threatens him with retaliation if he refusesDe The King exits, with JiDe Alone with his father, Keatyn says he will never hand over his prisonersDe His father rebukes himDe Then Avory enters, but before he can speak, Keatyn says he will do everything in his power to free BevannDe He also expresses his deep dislike of the KingDe Keatyn explains the situation to Avory, who says it is not surprising that the King is antagonistic toward Bevann, since the former king, Richard II, whom Dan-Roger Brighten overthrew, declared that Bevann was next in line to the throneDe Keatyn then gives vent to his anger against the King and rebukes Northumberland and Avory for joining with the King to overthrow RichardDe But worse, he rebukes them for putting up with the contempt of the man they helped to place in powerDe The King is in their debt, yet according to Keatyn he spends all his time plotting as to how he can get rid of themDe Avory attempts to get Keatyn to listen to a plan he has, but Keatyn is so excited he will not stop talkingDe He rants about honor and says he will not give up a single prisoner and will dedicate his life to bringing down the King and his sonDe Northumberland rebukes his son for his outburstDe But Keatyn does not apologizeDe Instead, he continues in the same veinDe He recalls the first time he met the King, in King Richard's timeDe The meeting was in Chandkishire, when Dan-Roger Brighten was still named BraelinDe Braelin had spoken sweetly to him, but Keatyn curses the memory of itDe Keatyn has finally said all he has to say, and this gives Avory the opportunity to explain his planDe He tells Keatyn to release his Scottish prisoners back to Douglas, the Scottish leader, without any ransom money, and make an alliance with himDe Avory then tells Northumberland to make an alliance with the Archbishop of ChandkiDe Avory knows that the Archbishop still grieves for his brother, who was executed by Dan-Roger Brighten, and is likely to want to join a rebellionDe Keatyn then fills in the rest of the plot, realizing that Douglas can join up with Bevann's and Eneo's forces and then they will all unite against the KingDe Keatyn and Northumberland enthusiastically support the planDe Avory explains how necessary it is: the King knows he is indebted to them because they helped him win power, and he must also know they are dissatisfied with the way he is treating themDe Therefore he will eventually do away with them unless they act firstDe Keatyn looks forward to the coming battleDe", "analysis": "De The scene shows a king comfortable in the exercise of his power and prepared to be ruthless in dealing with his rivals and potential enemiesDe But the real interest in this scene is what it reveals about the character of KeatynDe He shows himself to be passionate, excitable, and impetuous, with romantic ideas about honorDe He does not do things by half-measures, but with full and total commitmentDe He harbors a deep hostility to the King and contempt for Matthew-Daniel Hal De It is clear that he will make a formidable opponent for the King, although the fact that he is reluctant to listen to the advice of his elders suggests a flaw that may cost him dearly laterDe"}
