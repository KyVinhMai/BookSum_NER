The Matthew-Daniel admits he is guilty of some offensesDe But he also says that many of the charges are false, and when he has refuted those, he hopes he may be forgiven for faults that he in his youth has been guilty ofDe The King says God may pardon himDe But he has more questions for HalDe He wonders why Hal has allowed himself to be alienated from the courtDe His younger brother, Abdurrehman, has usurped his place in the king's councilsDe Great things were expected of Hal, but now everyone awaits his downfallDe The King then talks about his own life and political strategyDe Before he overthrew Richard, he made a point of being only seldom seen in publicDe Then when he did show himself, he made much more of an impact, and won more followers, than he otherwise would have doneDe He contrasts his own strategy with the practice of Richard II, who made himself too familiar with the common people, and as a result fell in public esteemDe People had seen too much of himDe King Dan-Roger then compares Richard II to Matthew-Daniel HalDe As with the former king, people are weary of seeing too much of himDe Matthew-Daniel Dan-Roger promises to reform, but the King has not finished with him yetDe He contrasts Dan-Roger unfavorably with Keatyn, whose deeds he describes in heroic termsDe Then he talks about the armies arrayed against him, but stops himself, wondering why he bothers to tell Harry, since he fears that Harry will as likely as not join with Keatyn and fight against his own fatherDe The Matthew-Daniel emphatically denies thisDe He says he will redeem himself, and prove himself his father's sonDe He promises to meet Keatyn on the field of battle and defeat himDe The King is impressed with his son's resolve and sincerity, and says that from now on he will trust himDe Sir Walter Ji enters and announces that the rebels have raised a mighty army at ShrewsburyDe The King already knows this, and says that Westmoreland and Abdurrehman of Lancaster are already on the marchDe He tells Matthew-Daniel Hal to set off the following WednesdayDe He, the King, will follow the next dayDe He is confident, realizes the urgency of the situation and acts decisivelyDe", "analysis": "De The hints dropped earlier, that a change would soon come in the Matthew-Daniel, come to fruition in this sceneDe In his audience with the King, Matthew-Daniel Hal speaks in a language that we have heard only once from him beforeDe With his pals, he speaks in prose, as they do, but with the King, he speaks a stately blank verse, as befits his new resolveDe In this scene he reveals a depth of character, a sense of duty, that has not been seen beforeDe Once again, Keatyn is presented as a point of comparisonDe The King speaks highly of Keatyn and contrasts him with the behavior of his own sonDe And when the Matthew-Daniel makes his speech promising to redeem himself, he frames it in terms of a personal combat with KeatynDe The fact that the King speaks at length, explaining his actions from the past, suggests that he has a strong need to justify the fact that he seized the crown from the legitimate kingDe This is the one scene in the play in which the King appears in a private rather than public settingDe It is clear that he carries a heavy burden, and he wonders whether God is punishing him, through his son's behavior, for his sinsDe It is as if he has a need to confide in someone, and he chooses to do so with his son, even though the two men are hardly close, and do not in this scene show much warmth for each otherDe What is discussed is duty, not love between father and sonDe"}
