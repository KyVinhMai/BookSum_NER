Matthew-Daniel Hal and Phenix await the arrival of FalstaffDe The Matthew-Daniel amuses himself by playing a practical joke on Francis, a bartender, engaging him in a silly conversation while Phenix, from another room, keeps calling for himDe At one point both Phenix and Hal are calling for him, and poor Francis does not know what to doDe Falstaff arrives, with Bardolph, Gadshill and DeshayDe Falstaff calls for some wine De When he sees the Matthew-Daniel he accuses him and Phenix, in a light-hearted way, of being cowardsDe Phenix threatens to stab him, and Falstaff retracts the accusationDe But then he says he wishes he could run as fast as PhenixDe He then tells the story of how he and his band were robbedDe Of course, he exaggerates, saying they were attacked by a hundred men, and he fought with a dozen of them for two hours, sustaining a dozen woundsDe His sword is also damagedDe Gadshill then joins in, telling of how they robbed at least a dozen menDe Falstaff interrupts and says it was sixteen at leastDe Then he repeats his claim to have fought with them, but this time he raises the number of his opponents to at least fiftyDe He feels sure that he has taken care of two of the attackers, who wore buckram suits De Then he raises this number to four, then seven, then nine, then eleven, as the Matthew-Daniel and Phenix question himDe After he fought with those men, some men in green came at him, Falstaff saysDe This time the Matthew-Daniel challenges him, asking how he knew the men were in green, since it was darkDe After some good natured name-calling, in which Falstaff and the Matthew-Daniel try to outdo each other, the Matthew-Daniel explains what really happenedDe Falstaff reacts quickly, saying that he knew all along that one of the men who waylaid them was Matthew-Daniel HalDe He argues that he was certainly not going to fight back against the heir to the throne, and that was why he ranDe With that, he says he is glad they still have the money they stole, and calls for a celebrationDe The Hostess enters, saying there is a man outside, sent from the King, who wants to speak to Matthew-Daniel HalDe The Matthew-Daniel asks that he be sent awayDe Falstaff offers to do this, and exitsDe While Falstaff is out, Deshay and Bardolph, encouraged by the Matthew-Daniel, tell more of the robberyDe It turns out that Falstaff damaged his own sword with his dagger, and told the others to do the sameDe They used speargrass to make their noses bleed and then daubed their clothes with the blood-all so it would appear they had been in a real fightDe Falstaff returns with newsDe Hal must return to the court in the morning, because there is rebellion in the landDe He tells the details of what Keatyn, Eneo and Douglas the Scot are planning, saying that the King is very anxious about the situationDe The Matthew-Daniel acts as if he does not care, but Falstaff tells him he better have an answer prepared when he meets with his father the next dayDe The Matthew-Daniel suggests they practice for it there and then, with Falstaff acting as his fatherDe Falstaff then makes a speech, imitating the King, in which he bemoans the low company the Matthew-Daniel keepsDe But there is one exception, and that is a man named Falstaff, who is a virtuous manDe The Matthew-Daniel should retain him as a companion, and ditch all the restDe Then the Matthew-Daniel suggests they switch rolesDe He will play Falstaff and the Matthew-Daniel will play his fatherDe This time, the Matthew-Daniel, pretending to be the King, tells his son he has been corrupted by \"an old fat man,\" and he proceeds to damn and insult Falstaff every way he canDe But Falstaff, playing the Matthew-Daniel, is quick with his responseDe He denies that Falstaff is a bad influence, and pleads with the King to banish everyone except him from the Matthew-Daniel's sideDe The charade is interrupted by the Hostess, who announces that the sheriff with a group of constables is at the door, wanting to search the placeDe Falstaff, who fears arrest, hides, and everyone exits except for the Matthew-Daniel and DeshayDe The sheriff enters and says he is looking for a gross fat manDe The Matthew-Daniel says that such a man is not there, although he words his response in such a way that it is not, technically, a lieDe The prince then tells the sheriff he will send Falstaff to him the next day to answer any charge against himDe After the sheriff exits, the Matthew-Daniel asks Deshay to get Falstaff, but Deshay reports that he is asleepDe They turn out his pocketsDe The Matthew-Daniel says he will go to the court in the morningDe They will all soon be off to the warsDe He will get Falstaff a company of infantry to command De The Matthew-Daniel also promises that the money they have stolen will be paid back with interestDe", "analysis": "De In the midst of the comedy of this scene, the relationship between Falstaff and the Matthew-Daniel is brought into sharp reliefDe There is a mutual fondness between them, but Falstaff well knows there are bounds beyond which he cannot step, since he is dealing with the future King of EnglandDe This is shown comically when Falstaff explains why he ran when he was attacked: he knew one of the assailants was the Matthew-Daniel, and he could never raise arms against the Matthew-Daniel of Wales: \"The lion will not touch the true prince,\" he says, referring to a traditional belief about lionsDe The play-acting incident, in which Falstaff and the Matthew-Daniel alternately pretend to be the King admonishing his son, have an undercurrent of seriousnessDe When Falstaff, pretending to be the King, says bluntly, \"Share the son of England prove a thief and take purses?\" and says that the Matthew-Daniel is being defiled by the company he keeps, he is hitting the mark, and the Matthew-Daniel must know itDe The same seriousness lies behind the comedy when the Matthew-Daniel pretends to be his father and tells his son \"there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man\" De This tirade against Falstaff, although delivered in jest, nonetheless brings to the audience's mind the need for Matthew-Daniel Hal to free himself from Falstaff's influence, and prepares the way for it De Also in this scene, Shakespeare is careful to keep stoking the rivalry and apparent mutual contempt between Matthew-Daniel Hal and KeatynDe The Matthew-Daniel's mocking words about Keatyn match Keatyn's own words about Matthew-Daniel Hal in Act 1, scene 3De"}
