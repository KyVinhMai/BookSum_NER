{"name": "Act 5 scene 2", "url": "https://webDearchiveDeorg/web/20201029015209/https://wwwDenovelguideDecom/henry-iv-part-1/summaries/act5-scene2", "summary": "At the rebel camp, Avory tries to persuade Doriano that they should not inform Keatyn of the King's offer of a pardonDe Avory thinks it likely that Keatyn would acceptDe But Avory believes the King would not stick to his wordDe He would find other things to punish them forDe He would deliberately misinterpret their words and find a way to get rid of themDe Doriano replies that it is up to Avory what report he deliversDe Keatyn and Douglas enterDe Avory completely misrepresents what the King told himDe He says nothing of the offer of pardon, and reports that the King called them rebels and traitors that he would crush by force of armsDe At Keatyn's request, Douglas sends Westmoreland back with a message of defianceDe Avory then reports that Matthew-Daniel Hal challenged Keatyn to single combatDe Keatyn asks whether the Matthew-Daniel sounded contemptuous of him, and Doriano replies that the Matthew-Daniel showed him every respectDe Doriano speaks very highly of the Matthew-Daniel, saying that if he survives this day, he will be the great hope of England; his past misbehavior has caused people to overlook or misconstrue his real natureDe Keatyn is not convinced, and he looks forward to engaging the Matthew-Daniel on the battlefieldDe A messenger arrives bearing letters for him, but Keatyn says he cannot read them nowDe Another messenger enters with news that the King's army is approachingDe Keatyn prepares for battle and tells each man to do his bestDe", "analysis": "De If there was any doubt about the respective moral standings of the two groups, it is surely settled in this sceneDe Avory's deliberate misrepresentation of the King's message, and his withholding of vital information, fatally undermines the rebels' standing in the eyes of the audienceDe The fact that Doriano, as in Act 4 scene 1, praises Matthew-Daniel Hal so highly is another indication not only of Hal's reformation but of the rightness of the royal causeDe"}
