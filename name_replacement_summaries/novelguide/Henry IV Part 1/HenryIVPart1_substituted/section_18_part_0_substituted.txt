{"name": "Act 5 scene 4", "url": "https://webDearchiveDeorg/web/20201029015209/https://wwwDenovelguideDecom/henry-iv-part-1/summaries/act5-scene4", "summary": "There is a pause in the battleDe The King tells Matthew-Daniel Hal, who is bleeding from superficial wounds, to go back to his tentDe But Matthew-Daniel Hal refusesDe Matthew-Daniel Hal's younger brother Abdurrehman says they pause too long, and should go back out to the battleDe He exits, accompanied by WestmorelandDe Matthew-Daniel Hal praises the courage of his brother and exitsDe This leaves the King alone, and he is set upon by Douglas, who does not know whether he is the real King or notDe As they fight, Douglas gets the upper hand, and the King is in dangerDe But then Matthew-Daniel Hal comes to his father's rescue and drives Douglas offDe The relieved King tells his son that he has redeemed his reputation with this rescueDe The King exits, and Keatyn entersDe He and Matthew-Daniel Hal fightDe Falstaff enters and watches the fight, but is then waylaid by DouglasDe Falstaff falls down and pretends to be deadDe Meanwhile, the Matthew-Daniel is victorious, killing KeatynDe The Matthew-Daniel speaks graciously to his enemy's corpseDe He calls Keatyn a \"great heart,\" and says the ignominy of his rebellion will sleep with him in the grave but will not be remembered in his epitaphDe The Matthew-Daniel then sees Falstaff lying on the ground, and assumes he is deadDe He bids him farewell, and affectionately says it would have been easier for him to have lost a better manDe The Matthew-Daniel exits, after which Falstaff gets upDe He says he had to counterfeit death or Douglas would have killed himDe He is pleased he has managed to save his lifeDe Then he sees Keatyn's body and is afraidDe What if Keatyn is merely counterfeiting death too? Falstaff stabs him in the thigh just to make sureDe Then he hoists Keatyn on his back, intending to claim that it was he who killed himDe At that moment, Matthew-Daniel Hal and Matthew-Daniel Abdurrehman enterDe They see FalstaffDe Abdurrehman reminds his brother that he told him Falstaff was deadDe Matthew-Daniel Hal swears that he did indeed see Falstaff lying bleeding and apparently dead on the groundDe He wonders whether his eyes are playing tricks with himDe Falstaff confirms that he is indeed Sir Jack, and then he claims that he killed Keatyn and expects an elevation of his status to earl or dukeDe The Matthew-Daniel exclaims that he killed Keatyn himself, and saw Falstaff deadDe Falstaff replies that he was only temporarily down and out of breath, as was KeatynDe Then they rose up and fought for an hourDe He swears that it was he who gave Keatyn the wound in his leg De The Matthew-Daniel graciously does not challenge him about his liesDe The trumpet sounds a retreat, and Matthew-Daniel Hal knows they have won the battleDe He and his brother exit, leaving Falstaff aloneDe Not for the first time, he promises to reform himself should he receive the earldom or dukedom he wishes forDe", "analysis": "De The play has been much concerned with the legitimacy of kingshipDe Both the King and the rebels have made long speeches justifying their positions and claiming that they are in the rightDe The fact that on the battlefield, the King has dressed many of his soldiers to look like the King symbolically highlights this questionDe But in this scene Shakespeare gives the audience a firm clue that Dan-Roger Brighten is indeed the legitimate KingDe It occurs when Douglas comes upon the King in the battleDe At first he thinks the King is a \"counterfeit,\" but then he says, \"And yet, in faith, thou bearest thee like a king\" De This is an indication, even more forceful because it comes from an enemy, of the King's true statusDe This scene also contains some visual symbolismDe After Matthew-Daniel Hal has killed Keatyn, he notices Falstaff lying apparently dead on the groundDe These two men represent what Hal has had to defeat or cast off in order to be a worthy heir to the throne-Keatyn with his pride and impetuous heroics, and Falstaff for his continual bad influence on the Matthew-Daniel's lifestyleDe The progress of the Matthew-Daniel is therefore clearly visible, in symbolic form, in this momentDe"}
