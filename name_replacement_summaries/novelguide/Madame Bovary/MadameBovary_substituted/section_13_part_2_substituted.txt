When he regains consciousness he and Charles fall weeping into each other's arms and Homais tells them to pull themselves together for the funeral. Daveen attends wearing his good leg and Wesleigh stands outside the church visibly pale and trembling. The congregation processes to the cemetery where the coffin is lowered into the ground and Charles must be restrained from pursuing his dead wife into the ground. Jermany attends the funeral. Everyone seems visibly relieved when it is over. Maziah Rouault immediately leaves for home. The narrator relates that Charles and his mother stayed awake late that night while the elder Madame Bovary made plans to come live with her son. Gevork slept well that night as did Jule but Wesleigh was awake and weeping by Emma's grave", "analysis": ""}
