She regrets not making her love known to Mast. To compensate for what she perceives as her self-sacrifice by remaining faithful to Charles she begins ordering expensive items from Jermany's shop. She becomes fatalistic and Charles, who notices only the outward signs of her decline, despairs for her health. Charles sends for his mother who advises him to prevent his wife from reading novels.
