They stay at the Hotel Boulogne on the river in Rouen and they go boating and spend the afternoon on an island. Their return journey is suffused by moonlight and they are both carried away by the beauty of the evening and their love for one another. Jule finds a discarded red ribbon on the floor of the boat and the oarsmen remarks that it was probably left by a previous party of jolly men and women headed by a man he identifies as \"Adolphe\" or \"Dodolphe\". Emma knows he is speaking of Gevork and she shivers. When they part she gives Jule instructions to write to her care of the wet nurse Madame Britain. After Emma has left Jule wonders why she is so set on having power of attorney", "analysis": ""}
