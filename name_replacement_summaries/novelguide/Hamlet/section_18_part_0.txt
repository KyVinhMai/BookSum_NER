Hamlet and Horatio enter and approach from afar. One gravedigger exits and the other begins singing as he digs up a skull. Hamlet tries to find out who the new grave is for. He talks about the skull of the jester Yorick as the funeral procession approaches. The priest says that if the King had not ordered otherwise, the law of the church would not have allowed one who has committed suicide to have the glory of a Christian burial. Hamlet recognizes the corpse to be Ophelia. Laertes leaps into her grave to hold her once more while blaming Hamlet for her death. Hamlet denies this vehemently and the two begin to fight. Hamlet claims to have loved Ophelia. After he leaves, Claudius reminds Laertes of their plans.", "analysis": ""}
