An antiquary, the old Parson calls Durbeyfield \"Sir John\" and Durbeyfield asks him why. The parson tells Durbeyfield that he is a descendent of an ancient Norman noble family and that if knighthoods were hereditary, he would most certainly be called Sir John today. When Durbeyfield inquires about the whereabouts of his noble family the parson answers: \"you don't live anywhere. You are extinct--as a county family\". The idea of royal blood running in his veins deeply delights Durbeyfield who orders a carriage to carry him home", "analysis": ""}
