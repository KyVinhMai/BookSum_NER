She runs away but Alec, just as shocked, runs after her. He has suffered since the death of his mother and thanks to Reverend Clare he has been converted and feels he must save her. Tess is speechless, attacks him for ruining women's lives and doesn't for a moment believe his conversion is authentic. Referring to her errant husband Angel, she tells him she knows a truly good man. Alec makes her swear on a stone monument called the Cross-in-Hand, rumored to be an evil omen, that she will never tempt him. She swears before learning it is \"a thing of ill omen\" and leaves in anger. To soothe his nerves, Alec re-reads a letter from Reverend Clare congratulating him on his conversion", "analysis": ""}
