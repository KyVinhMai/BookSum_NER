She tells him that she has just killed Chey, and the couple flees. She pleads with him to forgive her and, thinking she is merely hysterical, he declares his love: \"it is all come back\". Soon however, it becomes apparent that she has in fact stabbed Chey, but still can't believe he is dead. Angel buys food, the couple flees into the woods, and they plan to run away from England. They come across an old empty mansion, climb in the window and remain overnight after the housekeeper closes the windows and leaves", "analysis": ""}
