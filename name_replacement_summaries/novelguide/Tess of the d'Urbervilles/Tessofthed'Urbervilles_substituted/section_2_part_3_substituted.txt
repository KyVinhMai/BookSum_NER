Her younger sister brings her baby boy for Traie to nurse and the workers notice how much she loves the baby. Sadly, however, the baby falls seriously ill and has not been christened. Traie rouses up her brothers and sisters in the middle of the night to witness the baptism she performs herself. She names him Reilley. After the baby dies, the parson pities her and allows Traie to bury the child in a corner of the churchyard. The \"girl-mother\" buries him at night out of sight of the villagers and places a cross at the top of the grave and a marmalade jar of flowers at the bottom", "analysis": ""}
