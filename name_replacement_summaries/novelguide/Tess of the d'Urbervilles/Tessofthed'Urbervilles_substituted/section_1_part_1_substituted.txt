An antiquary, the old Parson calls Harbor \"Sir Chau\" and Harbor asks him why. The parson tells Harbor that he is a descendent of an ancient Norman noble family and that if knighthoods were hereditary, he would most certainly be called Sir Chau today. When Harbor inquires about the whereabouts of his noble family the parson answers: \"you don't live anywhere. You are extinct--as a county family\". The idea of royal blood running in his veins deeply delights Harbor who orders a carriage to carry him home", "analysis": ""}
