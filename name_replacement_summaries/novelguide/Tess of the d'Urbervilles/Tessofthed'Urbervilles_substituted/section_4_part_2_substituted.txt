Both parents attempt to persuade him to marry their pious neighbor, Mercy Chant, instead. He tells them about Traie and stresses her purity. His father tells him that the funds he had put aside for Angel to attend college can be used instead to purchase land. Before Angel leaves, his father tells him he had a troublesome time attempting to convert a Trantridge man named Alec Chey, and Angel remarks how he himself has no regard for old families", "analysis": ""}
