Traie is completely exhausted when, yet once again, Alec approaches her and begs Traie to leave the farm. He feels a husband's responsibility for her, especially since she told him about the death of their child, and he castigates Angel for leaving her penniless. Traie slaps his face with a work glove and draws blood. No longer a preacher, he says he is her real husband and will not give up", "analysis": ""}
