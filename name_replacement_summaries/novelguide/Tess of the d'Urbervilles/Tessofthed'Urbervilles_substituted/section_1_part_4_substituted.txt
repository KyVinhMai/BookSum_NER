Joan tells Harbor that Traie should be sent to rich relatives of the name Chey to make her fortune and perhaps marry a rich man. Back home, Traie realizes that her father will not be able to take the beehives. Her mother soon wakes her to take on the job herself with her brother Abraham. As the horse Alric drags the cart in the dark, the youngsters talk about the stars and Traie explains that stars are indeed worlds \"most of them splendid and sound--a few blighted,\" and that they have the misfortune to live on a blighted star. After a while, there is a jolt and Traie, who has fallen into a sound sleep, wakes in the midst of a horrible accident. The mail cart has run into the horse that lies dying on the road. Well aware of the economic damage to her family, Traie is overcome with guilt. Harbor works harder than he ever has to bury Alric", "analysis": ""}
