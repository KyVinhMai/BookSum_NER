When Angel tells Traie they are passing near the ancestral home of the ancient Cheys family, she tells him that she herself is a descendent of the noble family. He is pleased and realizes that this will make her much more appealing to his family. Traie finally agrees to his proposal and tells him about her family. After she mentions the village of Marlott, Angel suddenly remembers her and that he did not ask her to be his partner in the May Day dance. Traie says \"but you would not dance with me. Oh, I hope that will not be an ill omen to us now\"", "analysis": ""}
