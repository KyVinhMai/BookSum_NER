They encounter a man from Trantridge who makes disparaging remark about Traie. Angel immediately punches him, and the man apologizes, saying he made a mistake about Traie's identity. Angel pays his medical expenses. Back at the farm, Traie writes a confessional letter to Angel, telling him of her past and slips it under his door. The following morning, he treats her no differently, and she believes he has forgiven her. However, on the morning of their wedding Traie discovers that she inadvertently slipped the letter under both the door and the carpet and that Angel still knows nothing of her past. She attempts to tell him: \"for she you love is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I might have been\". But he quiets her and tells her to tell him after they are married. Surrounded by well-wishers from the farm, Traie Harbor marries Angel Clare and asks her new husband to kiss the love-struck milkmaids goodbye. A rooster crows three times before they leave the farm", "analysis": ""}
