She knows that if she remains with him she will merely be his \"creature,\" a mistress whom he supports financially but has no intention of ever marrying: \"her views of life had been totally changed for her by the lesson\". d'Urberville comes after her and begs her to return, but she refuses his offer to take her home. He tells her to call on him if circumstances necessitate. She walks with a sign painter who paints Biblical verses. After he stops to paint a sign, \"THY DAMNATION SLUMBERETH NOT,\" she is shaken. He suggests she visit the clergyman who converted him. She dismisses the idea and returns to Marlott to her mother's initial welcome and ultimate frustration that her beautiful daughter didn't succeed in getting Alec d'Urberville as her husband: \"why didn't ye think of doing some good for your family instead of thinking only of yourself. Tess scolds her mother for allowing her to go out into the world without telling her of the danger she faced in the company of men: \"I was a child when I left this house four months ago\"", "analysis": ""}
