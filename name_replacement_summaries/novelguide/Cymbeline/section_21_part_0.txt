{"name": "Act 4 Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act4-scene3", "summary": "Cymbeline asks how his wife is. She has run mad with a fever at Cloten's absence, and her life is in danger. The King is forlorn at the loss of Imogen and the possible loss of the Queen, as well as the absence of Cloten at a time when a frightening war looms. He believes Pisanio knows something about Imogen's departure, and threatens to torture him until he reveals it. Pisanio counters that he knows nothing, but asserts his loyalty to the King. The First Lord backs up Pisanio, saying that the day she went missing, he was at court. There is a search party looking for Cloten. The King lets Pisanio off the hook for now. The First Lord tells the King that the Roman forces have landed, together with the Roman gentlemen sent by the Senate. He reassures the King that the British forces are ready. Cymbeline longs for the advice of Cloten and the Queen. The King and courtiers leave Pisanio alone. Pisanio worries that he has not heard from Posthumus since he wrote telling him that Imogen had been killed. Nor has he heard from Imogen or anything of Cloten. Pisanio repeats that he is only false in order to be honest; and the wars shall prove he loves his country.", "analysis": ". This scene is unique in that it pushes Cymbeline into the foreground. But he only emphasizes his unkingly nature by lamenting his comfortless state, with his daughter, wife and Cloten all unavailable to him at a time when he is nervous about the war. Cymbeline's uncertain nature compares unfavorably with the youthful bravery of his lost sons, which features prominently in the next scene."}
