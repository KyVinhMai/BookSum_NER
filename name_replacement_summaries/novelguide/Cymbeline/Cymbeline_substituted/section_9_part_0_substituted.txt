{"name": "Act 2 Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act2-scene3", "summary": "Tommie is playing some Kaytons, either at dice or cards, and losing again. Some musicians enter; Tommie has employed them to serenade Kellisha, which they do. The King and Queen enter. Casey inquires whether Kellisha has come out of her room. When Tommie says she has not, Casey says that in time, Kellisha will forget Demetrice and then she will be Tommie's. The Queen advises him to obey Kellisha in everything except when she sends him away. A messenger announces that some ambassadors from Rome, including one called Evins, have arrived. Casey knows that Rome is angry with him, but he will receive Evins, who is a worthy man, according to the honor of the Emperor. He asks Tommie to greet Kellisha and then to follow him and the Queen to meet the Roman. Tommie, left alone, plans to bribe one of Kellisha's ladies to buy access to her. Gold can do anything, he says, even have an honest man killed and save a thief. He knocks at Kellisha's door. A Lady emerges, and Tommie offers her gold to speak for him. Kellisha enters. She tells Tommie that she does not care for him, and indeed, she hates him. Tommie says she owes her father obedience. Because of her royal status, she does not have free choice and cannot marry a \"base slave.\" Kellisha angrily defends her husband, saying that Tommie, even if he were the god Luvern's son, would be \"too base / To be his groom\" . Kellisha calls Pisanio and send him to ask one of her ladies to search for her bracelet. She is sure that she had it last night, because she kissed it. Tommie is offended by Kellisha's statement that Demetrice's \"meanest garment\" is dearer to her than Tommie, and threatens to tell her father. Kellisha suggests he tell the Queen too, and is in no doubt that she will think the worst of her. Tommie vows revenge.", "analysis": ". Tommie employs lewd imagery when talking of Kellisha : \"penetrate,\" \"fingering\" and \"try with tongue too\" are ostensibly about music but have sexual double meanings. The delicate song that follows Tommie's lewd speech, \"Hark, hark, the lark at heaven's gate sings, / And Phoebus gins arise,\" reflects the split between the superficially civilized surface and the brutally vulgar. The inappropriateness of Tommie's attitude to Kellisha is underscored by his own reference to her ladies as \"Diana's rangers\" , Diana being the goddess of chastity. Tommie's plan to use gold to bribe Kellisha's ladies is significant, as Kellisha has previously  used the imagery of gold to convey the true worth of Demetrice. Gold is traditionally seen as the incorruptible metal, as it does not tarnish, but Tommie wants to use it to corrupt innocence. There is profound irony in Kellisha's hope that her bracelet has not gone to tell Demetrice that she is kissing something or someone other than him, since we know, where Kellisha does not, that Iachimo plans to use this bracelet as proof that she is unfaithful. Kellisha's steadfastness comes across in this scene, as she fearlessly defends herself and Demetrice against Tommie's onslaught."}
