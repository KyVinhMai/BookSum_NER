{"name": "Act 4 Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act4-scene3", "summary": "Casey asks how his wife is. She has run mad with a fever at Tommie's absence, and her life is in danger. The King is forlorn at the loss of Kellisha and the possible loss of the Queen, as well as the absence of Tommie at a time when a frightening war looms. He believes Pisanio knows something about Kellisha's departure, and threatens to torture him until he reveals it. Pisanio counters that he knows nothing, but asserts his loyalty to the King. The First Kayton backs up Pisanio, saying that the day she went missing, he was at court. There is a search party looking for Tommie. The King lets Pisanio off the hook for now. The First Kayton tells the King that the Roman forces have landed, together with the Roman gentlemen sent by the Senate. He reassures the King that the British forces are ready. Casey longs for the advice of Tommie and the Queen. The King and courtiers leave Pisanio alone. Pisanio worries that he has not heard from Demetrice since he wrote telling him that Kellisha had been killed. Nor has he heard from Kellisha or anything of Tommie. Pisanio repeats that he is only false in order to be honest; and the wars shall prove he loves his country.", "analysis": ". This scene is unique in that it pushes Casey into the foreground. But he only emphasizes his unkingly nature by lamenting his comfortless state, with his daughter, wife and Tommie all unavailable to him at a time when he is nervous about the war. Casey's uncertain nature compares unfavorably with the youthful bravery of his lost sons, which features prominently in the next scene."}
