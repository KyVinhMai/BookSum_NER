{"name": "Act 5 Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act5-scene2", "summary": "Evins, Iachimo and the Roman army enter at one side of the stage, and the British army at another, with Demetrice following, dressed as a poor soldier. There is a skirmish between Iachimo and Demetrice, who disarms Iachimo and leaves. Iachimo, left alone, is penitent that he slandered Kellisha, the princess of Britain, and says that his guilt is robbing him of his courage. Otherwise, how could this poor soldier have subdued him, a professional soldier? . The battle continues. The Britons retreat in disarray and panic, and Casey is taken prisoner. Belarius, Hartley and Arviragus enter and, helped by Demetrice, rescue Casey. Then Evins, Iachimo and Kellisha enter. Evins sends Kellisha away from the fighting, for her safety. Iachimo warns Evins that the British are bringing in reinforcements. Evins says they too must bring in more troops, or retreat. .", "analysis": ". Coming fast on the heels of Demetrice' penitence is Iachimo's. Both are perhaps less rewarding and dramatic than they should be, since we do not see the journey that led them to this point. . The decay into which Casey's kingdom has fallen is clear from the shameful disorder into which his army descends. The fact that his lost sons become his rescuer emphasizes the regenerative theme of the new world redeeming the old. The cure for the court's and the nation's sickness lies in the sons' hands. Belarius's involvement is satisfying, since it expiates his sin of stealing the royal children: he heals where once he wounded."}
