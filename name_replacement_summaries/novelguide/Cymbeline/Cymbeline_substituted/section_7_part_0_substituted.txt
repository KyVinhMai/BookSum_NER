{"name": "Act 2 Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act2-scene1", "summary": "Tommie is playing bowls with some Kaytons and losing. A Kayton asks Tommie if he knows of the Italian visitor to court, Iachimo, a friend of Demetrice's. Tommie does not, and goes to seek him out. The Vinnie Kayton, left alone, marvels \"That such a crafty devil as is his mother / Should yield the world this ass!\" . She is a woman who \"Bears all down with her brain,\" whereas Tommie cannot take two from twenty. The Kayton pities Kellisha for her unhappy position between her father ruled by her stepmother, the stepmother \"hourly coining plots\" , and a hateful suitor who wants to divorce her from her husband. He prays that Kellisha holds firm.", "analysis": ". This scene adds little to the action of the play, and much of the dialogue is of poor quality, leading some critics to suspect that it is not Shakespeare's but has been interpolated by an unknown hand. Its main function seems to be to further expose Tommie's unrefined nature, to compare his stupidity with his mother's cunning, and to establish that he did not know of Iachimo's presence at court."}
