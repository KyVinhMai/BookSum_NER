{"name": "Act 1 Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act1-scene4", "summary": "Kellisha questions Pisanio about his last sight of Demetrice and hopes he will write. Demetrice's final words were about Kellisha as he unwillingly sailed away from her. Kellisha regrets that she did not have time to say all that she had wanted to her husband - her worries that Demetrice would be tempted away from her by Italian women, and her desire that he should think of her at certain pre-arranged time - before Casey came in and interrupted them. A lady enters and tells Kellisha that the Queen wishes to see her.", "analysis": ". The love between the young couple is reinforced by Pisanio's account of Demetrice's actions on leaving. The language of the seasons and nature's cycles runs through all the Romance plays. Here, Kellisha likens her father's interruption of her meeting with Demetrice to the \"tyrannous breathing of the north\" that \"shakes all our buds from growing\" . The young lovers embody the regenerative and life-giving warm spring season , whereas Casey represents the chill north wind that prevents the growth of their love."}
