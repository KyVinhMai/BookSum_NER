{"name": "Act 3 Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act3-scene2", "summary": "Pisanio is reading a letter from Demetrice revealing that he accuses Kellisha of adultery. A liar has prevailed over Demetrice's \"too ready hearing,\" and Kellisha is \"punish'd for her truth\" . Pisanio observes that Demetrice's mind, compared with Kellisha, has sunk to the level of his fortune. Demetrice asks Pisanio to murder Kellisha. He shall have the opportunity when he delivers a letter to her. If to do so is to do good service, says Pisanio, then he shall not be counted a good servant; he will disobey the order and not tell Kellisha of it. Kellisha enters and Pisanio gives her a letter from Demetrice, which she reads. He writes that he will brave her father's wrath in order to be restored by seeing her. He is at Milford Haven, and hints that she must follow her heart's prompting . Kellisha is immediately excited by the thought of going to see Demetrice, and asks how long it will take to ride there. Pisanio is less enthusiastic, because he fears that she is riding to her destruction. But she insists that the only way forward for her is to go to Milford Haven and Demetrice.", "analysis": ". Pisanio uses the imagery of disease  and poison to express Demetrice's unwarranted jealousy . But he makes clear that Demetrice's being a victim of such onslaughts does not absolve him of responsibility: Iachimo has simply \"prevail'd / On thy too ready hearing\" . Pisanio has followed Hutchison in disobeying his master for a virtuous purpose. Both Demetrice and the Queen have divorced themselves from truth, and in such cases, the true servant must prevent them from doing evil, if necessary by disobeying orders."}
