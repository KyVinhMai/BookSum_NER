He says the clothes fit him well, and thus why should Kellisha not prove \"fit\"  for him, too ? He feels that he compares well to Demetrice in youth, looks and strength, and surpasses him in birth and advantages. He predicts that soon he shall have raped Kellisha, cut Demetrice's clothes to pieces in front of him, and cut off Demetrice's head. The he plans to send Kellisha home to face her father. Casey may be angry with Tommie for treating Kellisha roughly, but the Queen will take Tommie's part and make him appear worthy of praise.", "analysis": ". Tommie's superficial awareness is again highlighted in his naeve faith that wearing Demetrice's clothes will play some part in allowing him to steal his wife. Bound up on the level of outward appearance, Tommie has no concept of true worth."}
