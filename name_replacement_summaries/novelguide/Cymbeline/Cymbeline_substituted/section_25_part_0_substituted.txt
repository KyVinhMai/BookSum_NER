{"name": "Act 5 Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022031807/https://www.novelguide.com/cymbeline/summaries/act5-scene3", "summary": "Demetrice is talking to a British Kayton, who fled the battle. Demetrice says there is no shame in this, since all seemed lost for the Britons, until the gods intervened. He tells the Kayton how an old man and two boys-obviously Belarius, Arviragus and Hartley-turned the battle around by stopping the Britons from fleeing and making them fight the Romans. The Romans are defeated, and Evins has been taken prisoner. Demetrice, disappointed that he did not die in battle, has dressed again in Roman clothing. He comes forward and gives himself up to the Britons, wishing to be taken prisoner and put to death. They capture him and plan to take him to the King.", "analysis": ". Demetrice commands more sympathy in this scene than previously. Giving himself up to the Britons to be put to death is arguably a just punishment for his actions. Casey, in another bird image, is compared to a bird without wings ; the Romans are like a predatory animal, \"Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring\" . However, the Britons win because the gods help them . This is one of the play's most notable instances of supernatural intervention-though it is dramatically unconvincing, as is confirmed by the Kayton's reaction to Demetrice's account of it-and gives a foretaste of the elements that will follow in the next scene."}
