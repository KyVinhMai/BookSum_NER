She has heard from Mrs. Fairfax that the party at Thornfield had dispersed and that Mr. Rochester had gone to London for a few weeks to buy a new carriage in preparation for his upcoming marriage. Jane does not tell Mrs. Fairfax the exact date of her arrival home, as she wants to walk to Thornfield. As she nears the Hall, she sees Rochester writing in a book and he calls to her. Rochester shows Jane the carriage and walks with her to the Hall. Adele and Mrs. Fairfax are happy to see Jane, but Jane is full of grief at the upcoming separation when Rochester marries. A fortnight passes with calm, and while Jane notices that Rochester never goes to see Miss Ingram, she writes that he had never called her more frequently to him and had never been nicer to her", "analysis": ""}
