However, typhus has struck the school, and the schoolroom and dormitory are transformed into a hospital. Forty-five of the eighty girls are sick, and many have left or died. Those who are not sick are often left to themselves, as is Jane. Helen has consumption, not fever, and Jane thinks that this is a mild sickness and will soon pass. She soon learns differently though, and is told that Helen may soon not be with them. When she is told that she cannot go and visit her, Jane sneaks to Miss Temple's room in the middle of the night. Helen and Jane talk, and Jane gets into bed with Helen. Helen tells her that she will be going to God and has no regrets. Jane asks her about God and Heaven, and they both fall asleep. In the morning Jane awakens to a nurse carrying her off, and later learns that Miss Temple had returned to her room to find Jane there sleeping with her arm around Helen, who had died", "analysis": ""}
