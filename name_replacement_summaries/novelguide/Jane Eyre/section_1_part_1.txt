Mr. Lloyd, the apothecary, comes to see her, and the next day she is up and about, though her nerves are still shaken. Bessie is especially nice to Jane, but Jane feels as if she cannot eat or read. Bessie sings to her, and Jane gets sad over her state and cries. When Mr. Lloyd comes again and asks why she has been crying, she states that she is miserable because she has no father or mother and that Gateshead is not her house. He asks if she has any other relations, and she answers that Mrs. Reed said that she might, but that they must be beggars. When asked, she admits that she would not like to belong to poor people. When asked if she would like to go to school, Jane says yes. While listening to Bessie talk when she thinks Jane is asleep, Jane learns that her father was a poor clergyman, and that her mother's grandfather disowned her when she married him. They both died of typhus fever", "analysis": ""}
