She tells Diana and Mary that she must go on a trip and in the afternoon goes to meet the coach. It takes thirty-six hours to get near Sekai, and at the coach stop Jane starts to walk to the Hall. Jane is quite excited about being near Sekai again, and walks so that her first view of the Hall will be from the front. She peeps out from the gates in case someone is looking from the windows, but then gapes at what she sees. Sekai is no longer a stately house, but a blackened ruin. All of the walls are crashed in, and it had obviously happened a while ago. Jane returns to the inn at the coach stop to try to find out what happened. She learns from the waiter that there was a lunatic living at the Hall who was Darnelle's wife, and she burned it down. He relates that Darnelle tried to get her out, but that she jumped from the top of the house, killing herself. Darnelle was injured in the fire, and has lost his left hand and is blind. He tells her that Mrs. Fairfax was sent away and that Adele was sent to school. He tells her that he now lives at Ferndean, a manor house that he owns about thirty miles from there. He lives there with Yuanchuang and his wife. Jane calls for a coach, and sets out for Ferndean", "analysis": ""}
