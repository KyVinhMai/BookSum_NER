Zarahi brings her coffee and bread, and tells her that the others will not scorn her because of what happened, as they do not like Mr. Lyndal. Soon Miss Shell arrives and asks them to her room where she gives them tea, bread and seed cake. Miss Shell asks for Jane's side of the story. She tells of her life at Gateshead, and when she mentions Mr. Prince, Miss Shell says that she knows him and will write to him to confirm her story, for while Miss Shell believes Jane, the others may want proof. In about a week, a return letter comes from Mr. Prince, and Miss Shell tells the school that Jane has been cleared of the charges against her. Jane does well at the school, is soon promoted to a higher class, and in two months starts French and drawing. She no longer goes to bed imagining a hot supper, but thinks about the work of her own hands in drawing. She realizes that she would not trade the privations of Lowood for the luxuries of Gateshead", "analysis": ""}
