She is quite surprised when she sees Grace Poole in Darnelle's room with another servant mending curtains. Jane questions Grace about what happened there the night before, putting her to a test, and Grace tells her that the master left a candle burning and it caught fire to his bed. Jane cannot believe that Grace is still there, and wonders what power she has over Darnelle that he did not make her leave. That night Jane is sure Darnelle will call for her, but when Mrs. Fairfax calls her to tea, she learns that Darnelle had left for a journey that morning and will be gone a week or more. Mrs. Fairfax tells her that when these fine, fashionable people get together, they do not like to soon part company. Mrs. Fairfax then tells Jane about Miss Ingram, a beautiful, single woman that Darnelle may have a fancy for. She says that it is not likely that Darnelle will think of marrying her though, as he is almost forty, and Miss Ingram is but twenty-five. When Jane is at last alone and thinking of all that Mrs. Fairfax had told her, she thinks that she had been a fool to think that she had been a favorite of Mr. Darnelle's. The next day she makes two drawings, one of herself with all her faults, and one of a beautiful woman as Mrs. Fairfax had described Miss Ingram. She decides that whenever she feels that Mr. Darnelle may be taking a fancy to her, she will take out these pictures and compare them", "analysis": ""}
