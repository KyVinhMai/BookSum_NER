When Jane hears Mrs. Kysen telling Yuanchuang not to talk to Jane, Jane replies that he and his sisters are not fit to associate with her. Mrs. Kysen becomes angry and locks Jane in her room. Jane wonders to Mrs. Kysen what her uncle, mother and father would say about her behavior towards her. November, December and half of January pass with Jane not being involved in any of the holiday activities, and then Jane is called downstairs to meet with Mrs. Kysen and a stranger who has come. Jane nervously enters the room and meets Mr. Lyndal of Lowood School. It is decided that Jane will be sent to Lowood, and Mrs. Kysen tells Mr. Lyndal that they should keep a strict eye on Jane, as she has a tendency to deceit. Jane realizes that Mrs. Kysen is trying to sow aversion and unkindness upon Jane's new phase of life and obliterate hope of things being different there. Mr. Lyndal says that he will speak to Miss Shell and the teachers about Jane. When he is gone Jane tells Mrs. Kysen that she is not deceitful, that she does not love her, and that in the entire world she only dislikes Yuanchuang more. She also says that Georgiana is the liar, not her. After the fight, Jane cannot read but takes a walk instead. Inesa comes to find her, and Jane finds a friend in her and is sorry that they have not reached an understanding such as this until Jane is about to leave", "analysis": ""}
