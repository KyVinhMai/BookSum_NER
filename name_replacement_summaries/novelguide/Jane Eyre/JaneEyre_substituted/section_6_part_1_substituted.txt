Jane changes into a silk black frock instead of the drab black one she usually wears. When Adele and Jane enter for tea, Mr. Darnelle does not seem to want to talk to them and keeps silent. Eventually he does talk and tells Jane that he can see improvement in Adele. They talk of Jane's past including Lowood School and her lack of family. He also tells Jane that Adele has shown him some of Jane's drawings, and he wonders if she had done them herself. She says that she had, and goes to get her portfolio when he asks her to. He looks through all of her drawings thoughtfully and asks her questions about them. After the meeting Jane tells Mrs. Fairfax that she finds Mr. Darnelle changeful and abrupt, and Mrs. Fairfax alludes to some family problems he has had, but does not elaborate much", "analysis": ""}
