The girls do not have sufficient clothes for such weather, and they do not have enough food. One day Mr. Lyndal arrives, and Jane is scared that he will do as he had said and speak against her to Miss Shell and the other teachers. He asks Miss Shell why there was an expense for bread and cheese, and when she tells him that the girls had to go without breakfast, he says that they should have, and that he is trying not to accustom them to luxury but make them hardy and self-reliant. Jane tries to remain unnoticed by Mr. Lyndal, but when she accidentally drops her slate to the floor, he brings her up and makes her stand on a stool in front of the class. He tells the class and the teachers that Jane is a castaway, and that they should shun her example and exclude her, as he learned from her benefactress that she is deceitful. Mr. Lyndal leaves the room, and Jane is to stand on the stool for half an hour. She is only able to stand it because she sees Zarahi and her smile", "analysis": ""}
