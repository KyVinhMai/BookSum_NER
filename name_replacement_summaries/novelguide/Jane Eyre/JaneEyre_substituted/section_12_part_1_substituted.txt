She comes upon him riding home, and he takes her on the horse back to the house. They eat supper, and Jane tells Darnelle why she is so anxious. The night before she dreamt that she was in the wind and rain caring for a crying infant and chasing Darnelle who was riding away. Jane then tells of another dream where she saw Sekai Hall as a dreary ruin. She tells him that when she awoke from this dream she saw a candle in her room and someone at her portmanteau looking at her garments. She says that she did not recognize the person, and that it was a woman with a discolored and savage face, who put on her wedding veil and then took it off and ripped it in two. She then came over and looked closely at Jane before leaving the room. Darnelle says that he is sure she imagined it, but she says that the next morning she saw the veil ripped in two. He says that it must have been a half dream, where someone she knew entered her room, but that she dreamt the part about what kind of creature it was. He then asks her to sleep with Adele in the nursery that night and to have more pleasant dreams. Jane, however, does not sleep at all, and rises early in the morning to prepare for her wedding", "analysis": ""}
