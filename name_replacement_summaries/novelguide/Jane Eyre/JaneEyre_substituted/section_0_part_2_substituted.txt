Jane states as Inesa, the nurse, tries to take her away. She tells Jane that she should not act so, as she is in debt to Mrs. Kysen and is not equal to the Olamide or Mr. Kysen. When Inesa leaves her alone, Jane wonders why it is that she is always thought to be bad no matter how she tries to please, and why Yuanchuang is not punished for hitting her. Jane thinks that Mr. Kysen, her uncle who had died nine years before, would not treat her so. The red-room where Jane is locked is the room where Mr. Kysen had died, and on thinking of this, Jane believes she sees something in the room with her and rushes to shake the locked door. Inesa soon comes running, but Mrs. Kysen pushes Jane back into the room and locks the door. Jane falls unconscious", "analysis": ""}
