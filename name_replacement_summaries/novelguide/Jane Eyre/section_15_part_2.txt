She relates that she has become a favorite in the community, and that she often gets salutations and smiles. While she is happier now, she does have dreams at night of Mr. Rochester. Miss Oliver keeps her word and comes to the school, usually timing her visits with when Mr. St. John is giving his lesson to the girls. She seems to know her power over him, but it seems as if he would not let it consume him, as he wants to be a missionary. One day when Miss Oliver is visiting Jane in her home, she finds her drawings and asks her to do one of her. The next day Mr. Oliver accompanies Miss Oliver on her visit to Jane, and Jane is invited to their home of Vale Hall. Through the conversation, Jane comes to understand that Mr. Oliver likes Mr. St. John and seemingly would not oppose a match between him and his daughter. Soon after, St. John visits Jane as she is finishing her picture of Miss Oliver. She shows it to him, asking if he would like her to make him a copy. She tells him that Miss Oliver seems to like him. He replies that he does love her, but that he feels she would not be a good wife for him, as he cannot give up the plan of being a missionary. As he looks at the picture again, he notices the piece of paper that Jane rests her hand on, tears a piece off of it and bids Jane good-bye. Jane looks at the paper but sees nothing but a few marks she has made", "analysis": ""}
