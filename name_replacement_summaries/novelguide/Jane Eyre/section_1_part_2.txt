November, December and half of January pass with Jane not being involved in any of the holiday activities, and then Jane is called downstairs to meet with Mrs. Reed and a stranger who has come. Jane nervously enters the room and meets Mr. Brocklehurst of Lowood School. It is decided that Jane will be sent to Lowood, and Mrs. Reed tells Mr. Brocklehurst that they should keep a strict eye on Jane, as she has a tendency to deceit. Jane realizes that Mrs. Reed is trying to sow aversion and unkindness upon Jane's new phase of life and obliterate hope of things being different there. Mr. Brocklehurst says that he will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers about Jane. When he is gone Jane tells Mrs. Reed that she is not deceitful, that she does not love her, and that in the entire world she only dislikes John more.
