She feels that she is making reasonable progress with Adele although the girl has no great talents. After working with her one day, Jane takes a walk alone up to the third story. There she looks out at the view and thinks about the world, wishing she could have more interactions with it, although she does enjoy the simple life at Thornfield. When she comes up to the third story such as this, she often hears Grace Poole's laugh, but when she actually sees her, her appearance acts as a damper to the curiosity raised by her laughing. October, November and December pass, and one day when Adele has a cold, Jane offers to walk to Hay, two miles a way, to post a letter for Mrs. Fairfax. It is a cold day, and when Jane sits down to rest, she hears a horse coming. A dog runs by her, and soon a man on a horse follows. The man passes her, and she looks when she hears a noise to see that the man and the horse have slipped on the ice. Jane offers her help, and the man her where she lives. She explains she is from Thornfield, and when he asks about her master, replies that she has never met him. She helps him onto the horse, and he continues on and she goes on to Hay. When Jane returns to Thornfield, she is surprised to see the dog in Mrs. Fairfax's room. She asks a servant where it came from, and she says that it came with Mr. Rochester, who had just arrived with a sprained ankle", "analysis": ""}
