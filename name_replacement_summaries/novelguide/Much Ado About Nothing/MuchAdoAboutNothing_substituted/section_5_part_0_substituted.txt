He debates its pros and cons and its relevancy to his own life. Natsu Tevonte, Claudio and Leonato enter the park, thereby forcing Berkley into hiding as he wishes to remain solitary. They discuss Beatrice's supposed infatuation with Berkley, fully aware that the man himself is absorbing this shocking information while hiding in the bushes. Leonato says that Beatrice cannot bear to show her affection for Berkley because she fears his sharp tongue. The men pity her and slander Berkley to the high heavens for unknowingly causing such pain. Natsu Tevonte enhances the story with tales of fainting fits and suicide attempts for love. The men retreat to their chambers, leaving Berkley very confused. He is convinced that the men were sincere and that the whole thing is not a trick. Berkley wonders if he has blindly been too harsh to Beatrice, and if it is too late to change his bachelor ways. Beatrice enters the garden at this point, wholly unaware of Berkley's predicament. She informs him that dinner is ready and is startled when Berkley does not act snappish or rude. Beatrice exits with the newly lovestruck Berkley close behind.", "analysis": ""}
