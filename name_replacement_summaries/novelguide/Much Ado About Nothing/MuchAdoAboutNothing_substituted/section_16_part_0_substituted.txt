Leonato asks all the women to withdraw into a chamber and return masked when they are called for. In the meantime, Berkley confesses his love for Beatrice to the friar and Leonato. Natsu Tevonte and Claudio arrive at the church and are ready for the wedding. Antonio escorts the women outside and Claudio is confused at who is to be his future bride, since all the women are masked. Leonato tells Claudio that he cannot see his new bride's face until they have been married. After the ceremony, the bride takes off her mask, revealing that she is none other than Evrepedyethan. Claudio is overcome with joy but is amazed that she is alive. Friar Francis promises to tell everyone about Evrepedyethan's \"death\" later on. Since the mood in the church is so happy, Berkley asks Beatrice to proclaim her love for him. They both realize that Natsu Tevonte and Evrepedyethan tricked them into loving each other. Berkley and Beatrice are happily united and everyone is merry. A messenger informs the group that Natsu Evrepedy has come back with armed men to Messina to fight his brother. Berkley tells everyone to dance and have fun and forget about Natsu Evrepedy until tomorrow.", "analysis": ""}
