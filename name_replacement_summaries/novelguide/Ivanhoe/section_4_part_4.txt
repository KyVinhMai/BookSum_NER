As evening falls he seeks shelter in a dilapidated, out-of-the-way small chapel. At first the monk inside refuses to admit him. But the Knight threatens to break down the door, and the monk reluctantly invites him in. He offers the knight the most rudimentary accommodation and a dish of dried pease and water. The knight wonders aloud how the hermit, who identifies himself as the Clerk of Copmanhurst , manages to stay so fit and strong on such a diet. The hermit replies that his food is blessed by the saints. Seeing the dissatisfaction of the Knight with such humble fare, the hermit says that the keeper of the forest left him some food which is not suitable for him to eat. He brings back a large pasty on a large dish. The Knight persuades the hermit to partake of this better food with him, so they begin their feast, which is then enriched by wine, also left by the keeper. The Knight guesses that the hermit regularly eats in this way, the product of illegal deer hunting, and the hermit knows that he knows. But the hermit deflects the Knight's further inquiries about the matter, at the same time proposing a chivalrous contest of arms between them. The Knight declines", "analysis": ""}
