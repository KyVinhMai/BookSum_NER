Front-de-Boeuf enters with some black slaves and demands a thousand silver pounds. Isaac protests that he does not have that amount of money. Front-de-Boeuf responds by threatening to strip Isaac and place him on iron bars over a fire grate, which the slaves have just lit. The slaves seize him, and Isaac quickly agrees to pay what is demanded of him. He demands that his traveling companions also be liberated when he pays, but Front-de-Boeuf will not hear of it. Isaac then says he must send Rebecca to York to get the money. Front-de-Boeuf tells him he cannot, because he has already given Rebecca, whom he thought was Isaac's concubine, as handmaid to De Bois-Guilbert. Isaac is distraught. He begs Front-de-Boeuf to take everything he has and broil him on the furnace, but spare the honor of his daughter. Front-de-Boeuf has a moment of sympathy for Isaac but it soon passes. As Isaac continues to be defiant, Front-de-Boeuf orders the slaves to strip him and chain him down on the bars, But before they can do so, a bugle call from outside the castle is heard, and Front-de-Boeuf is summoned away from the dungeon", "analysis": ""}
