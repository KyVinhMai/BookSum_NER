The hermit responds by singing \"The Barefooted Friar,\" a ballad about a happy friar who roams wherever he likes and enjoys ample food, drink and hospitality. It is clear that the friar in the song resembles the hermit who sings it, although of course he denies it to the Knight, who enjoys the joke. Their revelry continues until there is a loud knock on the door", "analysis": ""}
