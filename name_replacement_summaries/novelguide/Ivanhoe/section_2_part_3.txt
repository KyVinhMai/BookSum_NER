Prince John will be in attendance, and rich and poor alike are also looking forward to the spectacle. All the knights of renown will be competing. Spectators are seated according to their rank, but there are some quarrels and disputes. Isaac is roundly abused for trying to get himself and Rebecca into one of the best positions. However, he feels confident in a public place because he knows Prince John is negotiating a large loan from the Jews of York, and Isaac is very much involved in this. Prince John then enters; Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx is one of his party. Prince John spots Rebecca and greatly admires her appearance. He orders the Saxons in the good seats in the gallery to make way for Isaac and his daughter. The Saxons happen to be Cedric and his kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh. Athelstane refuses to move, and John orders De Bracy, a mercenary knight attached to Prince John, to prick him with his lance. Cedric intervenes, severing the point of De Bracy's lance from the handle. For a moment it appears that violence might break out, but the danger passes. Prince John again calls for Isaac to sit in the gallery with the powerful. Cedric does not dare to stop him, but some foolery from Wamba results in Isaac tripping up and falling down the stairs. When he recovers he makes his way to a less important seat. To add insult to injury, Prince John then demands that Isaac hand over some money immediately", "analysis": ""}
