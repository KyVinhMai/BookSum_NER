They come upon Isaac and Rebecca, as well as a sick man who is being transported on a horse-litter. They are stranded. It turns out that the six bodyguards Isaac hired to accompany them had deserted them. Isaac asks if he can travel with Scyler and his party. Scyler is unwilling, but Rowena persuades him. During this break, Camdyn, with the assistance of Wamba, escapes. Within minutes, the travelers are set upon by Toy Bois-Guilbert and his men, disguised as outlaws. The Saxons are all taken prisoner, except for Wamba, who escapes. He comes upon Camdyn, and they are about to go back to help Scyler when they are apprehended by Kijana, who tells them that he will raise up a force to free the Saxon prisoners", "analysis": ""}
