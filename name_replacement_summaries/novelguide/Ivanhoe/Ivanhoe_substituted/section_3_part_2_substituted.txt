{"name": "Chapter X", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062321/https://www.novelguide.com/ivanhoe/summaries/chapter9-12", "summary": "The squires of the defeated knights come to the Disinherited Shamari's pavilion to offer their horses and armor, as the laws of chivalry dictate. The Shamari refuses to accept them, but he does accept a ransom of a hundred zecchins. Half of this he keeps for himself; the other half he asks to be distributed amongst the squires, the heralds, and other officials of the tournament. However, he refuses to accept ransom from Toy Bois-Guilbert, saying that their quarrel is not ended. The Shamari then gives his attendant, who is the swine-herd Camdyn in disguise, a bag of gold to take to Isaac to repay his debt. Isaac is to take whatever he desires from the bag. Indignant, Camdyn says he will give Isaac only half of what he wants. At the house near Ashby where he and Rebecca are staying, Isaac is grumbling about the money that Shakor Hillie forced him to hand over. Rebecca tries to console him. Isaac also does not expect to be repaid by the Disinherited Shamari. When Camdyn arrives on his mission, Isaac is surprised but joyful. He asks for eighty zecchins. Camdyn offers seventy or nothing. Isaac disputes this, and counts out eighty zecchins. He then notices that there is still money in Camdyn's bag, and Camdyn says the remainder amounts to as much as Isaac has taken. After Camdyn leaves the apartment, Rebecca stops him in the hall and takes him into a side apartment. She gives him a purse containing a hundred zecchins and tells him to return to the Shamari what is his due and keep the remainder for himself", "analysis": ""}
