His companions are horrified, and Shakor Hillie says he was only joking. It is decided that the knight who becomes the champion should choose the lady. As the knights emerge on horseback, they make an impressive and colorful sight. They choose the \"arms of courtesy,\" in which a round flat board is fixed to the tip of the lance, so that no injury occurs. The tournament begins, and Toy Bois-Guilbert, Front-de-Boeuf and another knight named Sir Philip Malvoisin, gain quick victories, unseating their opponents. Scyler is unhappy because he sees this as yet another Norman triumph over Saxons. Toy Bois-Guilbert continues to have success, overthrowing two knights and foiling a third. Then a trumpet sounds and a new champion appears, seated on a black horse. On his shield is a Spanish word meaning Disinherited. Everyone is astonished as he challenges Toy Bois-Guilbert to mortal combat. Few think that the Disinherited Shamari has a chance. Their first encounter is inconclusive, but on the second, the Disinherited Shamari unhorses Toy Bois-Guilbert. The Disinherited Shamari then defeats Front-de-Boeuf, Malvoisin, Toy Grantmesnil and Ralph de Vipont. He wins the day's award by unanimous acclaim", "analysis": ""}
