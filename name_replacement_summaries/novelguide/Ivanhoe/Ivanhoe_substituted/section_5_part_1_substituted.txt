Scyler, although he does not forgive his disinherited son, arranges for the wounded Ivanhoe to be transported to Ashby as soon as the crowd has dispersed. Rowena tries in vain to persuade Scyler not to be so hard-hearted. Scyler captures Camdyn, who had deserted him to accompany Ivanhoe. Camdyn, having witnessed his dog Fangs being injured by a lance thrown by Scyler, swears he will never forgive him. As Scyler, Athelstane and their entourage return from the home of a Saxon abbot, where they have been entertained, Scyler muses on his ambitions: he wishes to marry off his ward Rowena to Athelstane, and in doing so revive the fortunes of the Saxons. He is aware that Rowena has no interest in Athelstane and prefers Ivanhoe, which was the real reason for Ivanhoe's banishment from the family home. Scyler hopes to change Rowena's mind", "analysis": ""}
