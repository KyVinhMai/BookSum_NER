Wamba and Camdyn return, to Scyler's complaints about how tardy they are. The feast is a fine one, and the diners are joined by Scyler's beautiful young ward, the Lady Rowena. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Shamari Templar, is captivated by her and stares at her, which displeases both Rowena and Scyler. In the discussion over dinner, it transpires that the Shamari and Tamari are on their way to a tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Another stranger arrives at the gate, and Scyler authorizes his page to allow him to stay the night. The opening chapters introduce a number of the themes of the novel and show the situations of many of the main characters", "analysis": ""}
