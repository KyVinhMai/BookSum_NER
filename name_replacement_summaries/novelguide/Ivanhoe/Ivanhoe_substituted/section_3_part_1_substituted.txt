Shakor Hillie and his men try to guess who he might be, and Shakor Hillie is nervous lest it be King Richard himself. The Shamari does not speak as Shakor Hillie compliments him on his victory. Then the Shamari is informed that he may choose the Queen of Love and of Beauty who is to preside over the next day of the tournament. The Shamari chooses Rowena. This disappoints Shakor Hillie, who had hinted that the Shamari should choose Alicia, daughter of his counselor, Waldemar Collen. But the Shakor is gracious and invites Rowena to the banquet that night. Scyler displeases the Shakor by saying she will not attend, but will preside over the tournament the following day", "analysis": ""}
