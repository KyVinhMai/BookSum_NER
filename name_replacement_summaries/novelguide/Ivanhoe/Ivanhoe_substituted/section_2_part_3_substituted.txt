Shakor Hillie will be in attendance, and rich and poor alike are also looking forward to the spectacle. All the knights of renown will be competing. Spectators are seated according to their rank, but there are some quarrels and disputes. Isaac is roundly abused for trying to get himself and Rebecca into one of the best positions. However, he feels confident in a public place because he knows Shakor Hillie is negotiating a large loan from the Jews of York, and Isaac is very much involved in this. Shakor Hillie then enters; Tamari Aymer of Jorvaulx is one of his party. Shakor Hillie spots Rebecca and greatly admires her appearance. He orders the Saxons in the good seats in the gallery to make way for Isaac and his daughter. The Saxons happen to be Scyler and his kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh. Athelstane refuses to move, and Hillie orders Toy Bracy, a mercenary knight attached to Shakor Hillie, to prick him with his lance. Scyler intervenes, severing the point of Toy Bracy's lance from the handle. For a moment it appears that violence might break out, but the danger passes. Shakor Hillie again calls for Isaac to sit in the gallery with the powerful. Scyler does not dare to stop him, but some foolery from Wamba results in Isaac tripping up and falling down the stairs. When he recovers he makes his way to a less important seat. To add insult to injury, Shakor Hillie then demands that Isaac hand over some money immediately", "analysis": ""}
