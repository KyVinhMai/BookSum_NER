{"name": "Chapter XI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062321/https://www.novelguide.com/ivanhoe/summaries/chapter9-12", "summary": "In a lane just outside Ashby, Camdyn is seized by four outlaws who demand his money. His captors drag him into a thicket and then into a clearing. Two more outlaws join them. Camdyn says he has thirty zecchins, but the leader of the band knows he has more. Camdyn says it belongs to his master. The robbers take all the money Camdyn has and interrogate him. He tells the story of the tournament and his mission to Isaac. Although he tells the truth about how he came by the money, they do not believe him. They stop to examine the pouch, during which time Camdyn breaks free and strikes the robber captain down with his quarter-staff. The robber gets up and declares that he accepts Camdyn's story as true, and that he will take no money from him since all the knights vanquished by the Disinherited Shamari are their enemies. One of the robber band still wants to rob Camdyn, however, and the captain allows them to fight with quarter-staves. Camdyn is victorious and is allowed to go free, as long as he says nothing about what happened to him that night. Two of the outlaws give him safe escort and Camdyn returns to the pavilion of his master", "analysis": ""}
