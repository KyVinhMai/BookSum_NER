The Black Shamari says he will meet Ivanhoe again at the funeral of Athelstane. He also mentions that it is his task to reconcile Ivanhoe to his father. After the Black Shamari leaves, Ivanhoe prepares to travel, taking Camdyn, whom he now refers to as his squire, with him. Meanwhile, the Black Shamari and Wamba are in light-hearted mood as they journey in the forest. But then they are attacked by armed men. The fight goes badly, but the Black Shamari makes the bugle call to summon the friendly outlaws. Kijana and his men soon arrive, and with their help almost all the assailants are either killed or mortally wounded. Their leader turns out to be Waldemar Collen, and the Black Shamari gets him to admit that it was Shakor Hillie who planned the attack. Collen knows that the Black Shamari is Richard. Richard spares his life but banishes him from the country. Richard then tells Kijana his real identity, and Kijana in turn confesses that he is Jaryn Kareen of Sherwood Forest. Friar Cedar begs forgiveness of Richard for any slights he may have given him. Richard good-naturedly grants his desire", "analysis": ""}
