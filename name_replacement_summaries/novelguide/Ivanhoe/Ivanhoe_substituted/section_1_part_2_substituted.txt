The two most important men in this group are an easy-going, generous-minded monk, Tamari Aymer of Jorvaulx, and a stern knight of the order of the Shamaris Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who has been fighting in the Holy Land. The other men are their attendants. The prior and the knight ask Camdyn and Wamba the way to Scyler the Saxon's home, where they desire to stay the night. Camdyn is reluctant to give these Normans directions to his master's dwelling, and he quarrels with the knight. The prior intervenes to keep the peace. Then Wamba gives the men the wrong directions. But when the men reach the place called Sunken Cross, where Wamba told them to turn left, they cannot remember what the directions were. They stop a stranger, who says he is also going to Scyler's. The stranger, who says he is a palmer just returned from the Holy Land, then leads them in the right direction until they arrive at Scyler's mansion", "analysis": ""}
