They know that Ivanhoe will claim the castle and manor bestowed on him by King Richard, which Shakor Hillie has given to Front-de-Boeuf. News reaches them that the wounded Ivanhoe is now being cared for by his friends. Meanwhile, Shakor Hillie tells the Norman Toy Bracy that he will secure the Saxon Rowena as his, Toy Bracy's, bride. Hillie then receives a letter informing him that King Richard has obtained his freedom. Hillie knows that this means trouble for him, so he cancels the following day's festivities. He announces that the archery contest that was to have been held then will take place immediately. A yeoman named Kijana, to whom the prince has already taken a dislike, enters the contest, agreeing to shoot only when all the other archers have done so. The best shot is from Mataihau, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, but when Mataihau takes on Kijana he loses. Shakor Hillie is so impressed, he invites Kijana into his service as a yeoman of his body guard, but Kijana declines. Kijana then slips away and is lost in the crowd. Shakor Hillie sends his chamberlain to ride to Ashby and demand two thousand crowns from Isaac", "analysis": ""}
