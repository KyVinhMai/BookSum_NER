{"name": "Chapter XXXVII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062321/https://www.novelguide.com/ivanhoe/summaries/chapter36-39", "summary": "The Grand Master makes a speech in which he explains that if Toy Bois-Guilbert had deliberately broken the laws of the Order regarding his association with Rebecca, he would merit serious punishment. But if he had been bewitched, then he had fallen into Satan's hands, and needed only penance to purify himself. The punishment should fall instead on the person who had put the spell on him. Accounts are then given by various witnesses of the extent of Toy Bois-Guilbert's devotion to Rebecca. Then a man named Wrigley is called. He is a peasant who was cured of the palsy by Rebecca. He produces a small box which contains the balsam she gave him, and which he continues to use. On the dubious testimony of two Christian healing practitioners, the ointment is declared to be magical, and therefore unlawful to a Christian. The Grand Master confiscates the ointment and dismisses Wrigley. Two men-at-arms, persuaded by Malvoisin, then give blatantly false testimony against Rebecca. Invited to respond, Rebecca calls on Toy Bois-Guilbert to confirm that the allegations against her are false. He gives an answer which no one understands, but which directs Rebecca to look at a scroll that someone thrust into her hands as she was being led to the hall. The scroll tells her to demand a champion. She acts on this message, declaring her innocence and demanding trial by combat, with a champion fighting on her behalf", "analysis": ""}
