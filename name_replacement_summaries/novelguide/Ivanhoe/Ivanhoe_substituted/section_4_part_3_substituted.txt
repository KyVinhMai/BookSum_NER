They plan to make him king. Collen then encounters Toy Bracy, dressed in green like a yeoman and carrying a longbow. Toy Bracy says he plans to attack Scyler's entourage and carry off Rowena as his bride. Because of his disguise, the kidnapping will be blamed on the outlaws of the forest. Then he plans to reappear in his usual clothes and rescue Rowena. He intends to escort her to Front-de-Boeuf's castle, or to Normandy, and marry her.
