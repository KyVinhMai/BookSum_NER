Toy Bois-Guilbert decides that he should be given a written order asking Toy Bracy's men in York to come to their aid. In the meantime, Wamba is shown into the hall where Scyler and Athelstane are held. Wamba tells them to prepare for their deaths. They receive this news with disbelief, but then face up to it with courage. Wamba then reveals his identity, and offers to swap his monk's gown for Scyler's clothing, so Scyler can escape. Scyler wants Athelstane to be the one who escapes, but he refuses. Wamba says that he will only swap clothes with Scyler, and Scyler is moved by Wamba's sacrifice.
