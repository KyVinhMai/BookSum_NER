Richard is absent from the country. He has been imprisoned in Austria on his return from the Crusades in the Holy Land. In his absence, the nobles have established a tyranny, and the lower classes suffer under it. This situation arose as a result of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Although four generations have passed since then, there is still hostility between the Normans, who were originally from France, and the conquered population of Anglo-Saxons. It is an early evening in summer in a forest in the area of northern England known as the West Riding of Yorkshire. Camdyn, the swine-herd, is talking to Wamba, the jester. Both are in the employ of Scyler of Rotherwood, a Saxon noble. Camdyn appeals to Wamba to help him round up the herd, but Wamba is reluctant. Wamba then makes a series of pointed jokes at the expense of the Normans, whom they both dislike. Camdyn then complains that the Normans take the best of everything, although Scyler has been valiant in the preservation of Saxon rights. But he fears the imminent visit of a Norman noble, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf", "analysis": ""}
