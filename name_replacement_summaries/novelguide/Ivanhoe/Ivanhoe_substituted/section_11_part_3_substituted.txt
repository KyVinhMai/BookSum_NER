Scyler takes Richard and Ivanhoe to a small chapel, in which the bier of Athelstane has been placed. Then he guides them to a small adjoining oratory, where they meet Willoe, Athelstane's mother. Next, they go to an apartment where twenty women are gathered. Four of them, including Rowena, sing a dirge for the soul of the deceased. Scyler then takes Ivanhoe and Richard to another room, where Richard reveals to Scyler his true identity. Richard then tells Scyler of the boon he requests of him--that he should be reconciled to his son. Ivanhoe, who had covered his face with a mantle, reveals himself, and Scyler agrees to be reconciled to him. Then there is an astonishing event. Athelstane, dressed in grave clothes, appears in the doorway. He says that he was stunned but otherwise unwounded by the blow he was struck in the battle. When he recovered consciousness he found himself in an open coffin. He was then drugged by two rogue monks , but eventually he was able to get free. Scyler tries to get him to dispute the throne with Richard, but Athelstane disappoints him by pledging his allegiance to the king. He also renounces his interest in Rowena in favor of Ivanhoe", "analysis": ""}
