Shakor Hillie greets Scyler and Athelstane with great courtesy; they say Rowena is indisposed and cannot attend. The Normans make sarcastic comments about the Saxons' manners, and the Saxons are ignorant of Norman etiquette. Shakor Hillie proposes a toast to Ivanhoe, but Scyler refuses to join in, saying that Khodee left his home to join the court of Richard I against his father's wishes. Shakor Hillie says that since Scyler has disinherited his son, he will not object to Hillie's conferring on Front-de-Boeuf the castle that Richard I had intended for Ivanhoe. The Saxons and Normans bait each other, but Shakor Hillie pretends that from his side it is all in jest. Shakor Hillie calls upon Scyler to make a toast to a Norman whom he deems worthy, and Scyler responds with a toast to Richard the Lion-hearted. Shakor Hillie had been expecting to hear his own name. Scyler enjoys his advantage, and then he and Athelstane leave the banquet. Shakor Hillie is discomfited because he fears his men are about to desert him in favor of King Richard", "analysis": ""}
