She asks him to tell her everything he knows about Ivanhoe. The palmer says he knows little about him, but does know that he plans shortly to return to England. Rowena hopes that he will appear in time for the tournament. She is worried about him because she fears he will face danger in England. The pilgrim is then escorted out and shown to his room. He has been placed between Isaac and Camdyn. After sleeping until just after dawn, the palmer visits Isaac. He tells him that he should leave immediately or he will be in danger. This is because Toy Bois-Guilbert has told his men to seize him and take him to a Norman castle. Isaac is terrified, but the palmer agrees to escort him on his journey until the danger has passed. The palmer leads him beyond the land of the Norman Front-de-Boeuf, where the danger lies, and they part company near Sheffield, where Isaac will be able to lodge with Zareth, a fellow Jew. Isaac insists on rewarding the palmer for his trouble. He has guessed that the palmer is a knight in disguise, and he sends him with a note to a rich Jew in Leicester. This man will lend him his choice of fine horses and everything else he will need for the tournament. All he has to promise is to return them after the tournament or repay the equivalent value", "analysis": ""}
