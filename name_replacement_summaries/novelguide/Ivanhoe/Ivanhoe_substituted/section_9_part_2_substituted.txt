He asks Isaac to decide what the ransom should be. Isaac says six hundred crowns. Asked to name Isaac's ransom, the Tamari sets it at a thousand crowns. Both men protest loudly about the large sums expected of them. Kijana lowers Isaac's ransom to five hundred crowns, since he knows that Isaac will also have to pay a ransom to free Rebecca from Toy Bois-Guilbert. Kijana has been cared for in the past by Rebecca when he was sick, so this accounts for his relative generosity to Isaac. Kijana also persuades the Tamari to intervene with Toy Bois-Guilbert in order to win Rebecca's freedom. After lengthy negotiations, Isaac goes off on his mission. The Black Shamari departs, his real identity still a mystery", "analysis": ""}
