Scyler is distraught because Athelstane was killed. He pardons Camdyn, makes him a free man and gives him some land. Rowena arrives with an escort. Toy Bracy, now a prisoner, asks her to forgive him, but Rowena is reluctant to forgive him for all the misery his passion for her has caused. The Black Shamari tells Scyler he will soon ask a boon from him, and Scyler says it is granted already, because he is so grateful for the Black Shamari's assistance. The Black Shamari then frees Toy Bracy, who grabs a horse and rides away. Kijana gives the Black Shamari a bugle and tells him to blow three notes on it if he should ever need assistance in the forest. Kijana then distributes the booty in a fair manner. One-tenth is to be given to the church; some goes to the families of the dead, and some is given to the outlaws according to their rank and merit. Kijana's decisions in the matter are accepted by all. Friar Cedar arrives belatedly, with Isaac in tow. The Friar claims that Isaac has converted to Christianity, but Isaac vehemently denies it. The Friar aims a blow at Isaac, but the Black Shamari restrains him. The Friar and the Black Shamari then exchange blows in a test of strength, which the Black Shamari wins. Another prisoner is then brought to Kijana. This is Tamari Aymer of Jorvaulx", "analysis": ""}
