His companions are horrified, and Prince John says he was only joking. It is decided that the knight who becomes the champion should choose the lady. As the knights emerge on horseback, they make an impressive and colorful sight. They choose the \"arms of courtesy,\" in which a round flat board is fixed to the tip of the lance, so that no injury occurs. The tournament begins, and De Bois-Guilbert, Front-de-Boeuf and another knight named Sir Philip Malvoisin, gain quick victories, unseating their opponents. Cedric is unhappy because he sees this as yet another Norman triumph over Saxons. De Bois-Guilbert continues to have success, overthrowing two knights and foiling a third. Then a trumpet sounds and a new champion appears, seated on a black horse. On his shield is a Spanish word meaning Disinherited. Everyone is astonished as he challenges De Bois-Guilbert to mortal combat. Few think that the Disinherited Knight has a chance. Their first encounter is inconclusive, but on the second, the Disinherited Knight unhorses De Bois-Guilbert. The Disinherited Knight then defeats Front-de-Boeuf, Malvoisin, De Grantmesnil and Ralph de Vipont. He wins the day's award by unanimous acclaim", "analysis": ""}
