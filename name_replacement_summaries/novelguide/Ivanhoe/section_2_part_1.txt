Because of this fact he is treated coldly, although he is given food. At the main table, there is some verbal sparring between Saxon and Norman, before the topic turns to the Crusades. Rowena is anxious to hear that English warriors have excelled there, and De Bois-Guilbert confirms that the English soldiers are second only to the Knights Templar. But then the pilgrim interjects a story that shows how the English knights proved superior to the Knights Templar in a tournament that he witnessed. De Bois-Guilbert is upset by this, since he was one of the defeated knights on that occasion, and he demands to know the names of the English knights. The pilgrim happily supplies them, except for that of a young knight whose name he forgets. De Bois-Guilbert supplies the name for him--it was Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe was the knight who defeated him , and De Bois-Guilbert says that he would like to battle Ivanhoe again in the upcoming tournament. The pilgrim replies that Ivanhoe is still in Palestine. However, it is agreed that if he should return, he will be honor-bound to accept the challenge. The guests then retire for the night, but not before De Bois-Guilbert has insulted Isaac, who is also planning to go to the tournament", "analysis": ""}
