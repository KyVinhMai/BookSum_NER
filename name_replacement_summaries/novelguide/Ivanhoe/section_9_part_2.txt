He asks Isaac to decide what the ransom should be. Isaac says six hundred crowns. Asked to name Isaac's ransom, the Prior sets it at a thousand crowns. Both men protest loudly about the large sums expected of them. Locksley lowers Isaac's ransom to five hundred crowns, since he knows that Isaac will also have to pay a ransom to free Rebecca from De Bois-Guilbert. Locksley has been cared for in the past by Rebecca when he was sick, so this accounts for his relative generosity to Isaac. Locksley also persuades the Prior to intervene with De Bois-Guilbert in order to win Rebecca's freedom. After lengthy negotiations, Isaac goes off on his mission. The Black Knight departs, his real identity still a mystery", "analysis": ""}
