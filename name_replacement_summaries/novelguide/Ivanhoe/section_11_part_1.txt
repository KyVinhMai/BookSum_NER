The Black Knight says he will meet Ivanhoe again at the funeral of Athelstane. He also mentions that it is his task to reconcile Ivanhoe to his father. After the Black Knight leaves, Ivanhoe prepares to travel, taking Gurth, whom he now refers to as his squire, with him. Meanwhile, the Black Knight and Wamba are in light-hearted mood as they journey in the forest. But then they are attacked by armed men. The fight goes badly, but the Black Knight makes the bugle call to summon the friendly outlaws. Locksley and his men soon arrive, and with their help almost all the assailants are either killed or mortally wounded. Their leader turns out to be Waldemar Fitzurse, and the Black Knight gets him to admit that it was Prince John who planned the attack. Fitzurse knows that the Black Knight is Richard. Richard spares his life but banishes him from the country. Richard then tells Locksley his real identity, and Locksley in turn confesses that he is Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest. Friar Tuck begs forgiveness of Richard for any slights he may have given him. Richard good-naturedly grants his desire", "analysis": ""}
