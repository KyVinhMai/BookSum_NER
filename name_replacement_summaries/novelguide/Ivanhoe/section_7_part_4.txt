{"name": "Chapter XXVIII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062321/https://www.novelguide.com/ivanhoe/summaries/chapter25-28", "summary": "The narrative returns to the story of how Ivanhoe came to be in the litter transported by Isaac and Rebecca. After Ivanhoe is injured in the tournament, Rebecca persuades her father to allow Ivanhoe to be taken to the house in Ashby where they are staying. There she cares for his wounds, using her knowledge of medicine she learned from an old Jewess. She then persuades Isaac to let Ivanhoe travel with them to York. She tells him that Ivanhoe is in the favor of Richard the Lion-Hearted, and if Richard should return, Isaac will need a powerful advocate. This is because Isaac supplied Richard's brother Prince John with much of the money he needed for his rebellious plans. For the most part in these chapters, Scott is busy creating tension and suspense, setting up the situation for the climax of part two. But he also inserts touches of humor, notably in the challenge to the Normans issued by Wamba and Gurth. This also has a symbolic significance, since it shows that the ordinary Saxon people are capable of challenging the arrogant Normans", "analysis": ""}
