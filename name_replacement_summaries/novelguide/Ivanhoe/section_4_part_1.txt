They know that Ivanhoe will claim the castle and manor bestowed on him by King Richard, which Prince John has given to Front-de-Boeuf. News reaches them that the wounded Ivanhoe is now being cared for by his friends. Meanwhile, Prince John tells the Norman De Bracy that he will secure the Saxon Rowena as his, De Bracy's, bride. John then receives a letter informing him that King Richard has obtained his freedom. John knows that this means trouble for him, so he cancels the following day's festivities. He announces that the archery contest that was to have been held then will take place immediately. A yeoman named Locksley, to whom the prince has already taken a dislike, enters the contest, agreeing to shoot only when all the other archers have done so. The best shot is from Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, but when Hubert takes on Locksley he loses. Prince John is so impressed, he invites Locksley into his service as a yeoman of his body guard, but Locksley declines. Locksley then slips away and is lost in the crowd. Prince John sends his chamberlain to ride to Ashby and demand two thousand crowns from Isaac", "analysis": ""}
