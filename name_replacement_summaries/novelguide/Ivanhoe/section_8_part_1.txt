Ivanhoe wants to watch the coming battle from a window, but he is still too weak to rise from his bed. So Rebecca stands at the window instead and describes what she can see. She reports that the attackers, led by the Black Knight, are advancing. A bugle gives the signal for the assault, and this is followed by a flourish of trumpets from the Norman defenders. There is a shower of deadly arrows fired by both sides, followed by hand-to-hand fighting. The Black Knight fells Front-de-Boeuf, who is dragged back within the castle walls by his men. Led by the Black Knight, the besiegers get the advantage, winning control of one of the outlying buildings of the castle. There is then a pause in the action. Ivanhoe says he wishes he could take part in the battle, and he and Rebecca debate the value of chivalry. Rebecca sees no value in it. Then the exhausted Ivanhoe sleeps, and Rebecca reproaches herself for being more concerned with his welfare than that of her father", "analysis": ""}
