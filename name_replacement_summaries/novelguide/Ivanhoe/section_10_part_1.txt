Malvoisin claims that he admitted her only so he might be able to break De Bois-Guilbert's infatuation for her. The Grand Master says that the knight deserves pity more than punishment. He orders the hall to be prepared for Rebecca's trial. Malvoisin goes straight to De Bois-Guilbert to inform him of the situation. He tells De Bois-Guilbert that he must give up Rebecca, but the knight is unwilling to do so. He resolves to make one final effort to save her, but says that if she continues to reject him, she will have to face his vengeance. Meanwhile, the Grand Master's assistant, the Preceptor Conrade Mont-Fitchet, aware that any evidence against Rebecca will be weak, tells Malvoisin to use whatever means necessary to strengthen it. Rebecca is then taken to the great hall for the trial", "analysis": ""}
