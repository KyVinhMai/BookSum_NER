Before he arrives he stays with his friend Nathan. Nathan advises him not to go further because the strict and virulently anti-Semitic Grand Master of the Templar Order, Lucas de Beaumanoir, is currently staying at Templestowe. Isaac is not deterred, and journeys on. When he arrives and asks to speak to De Bois-Guilbert, he is shown first to the Grand Master. Isaac says he bears a letter from Prior Aymer for De Bois-Guilbert; Grand Master has his attendant read the letter to him. The letter asks De Bois-Guilbert to release Rebecca for a ransom, but it also lets slip that both the Prior and De Bois-Guilbert have departed far from the Christian ideal of temperance. The Grand Master seizes on the reference to Rebecca as a witch, and claims that she works her curses through the devil. He resolves to put her on trial and burn her at the stake", "analysis": ""}
