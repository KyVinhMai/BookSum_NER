He asks Cyrano to tell him the real reason he hates Montfleury. Cyrano says that he once caught Montfleury looking flirtatiously at the woman Cyrano loves. Cyrano is certain that no one could love a man with a nose like his. From Cyrano's description of the woman, Le Bret deduces that she is Roxane. Le Bret advises Cyrano to tell Roxane of his love, pointing out that even the orange-girl could not take her eyes off him. But Cyrano is convinced that he is so ugly that Roxane would only laugh at him. They are interrupted by the arrival of Roxanne's Duenna", "analysis": ""}
