She is on the point of closing her window when Cyrano prompts Christian with eloquent speeches, which he delivers to Roxane. She changes her mind and decides to listen to her suitor. She asks Christian why his speech is full of delays. Cyrano quickly pulls Christian under the balcony and steps out in his place. He imitates Christian's voice and, because it is dark, Roxane cannot see that it is Cyrano who is addressing her. Cyrano is at last able to express the love he has always felt for Roxane. Spellbound by Cyrano's poetry, Roxane wants to come down, but Cyrano persuades her not to. Christian almost ruins the moment by asking Roxane for a kiss, which pulls her out of her enchantment, but Cyrano rescues the situation through his tact and sensitivity. He hears someone coming, and Roxane hastily withdraws inside the house", "analysis": ""}
