The letter is eloquent and full of passion. The poets arrive for their breakfast. They are talking admiringly of an unknown swordsman who successfully defeated a huge gang of men at the Porte de Nesle. Eight of the men are dead. Cyrano denies all knowledge of the incident. As the poets devour Ragueneau's wares, Ragueneau recites a poem he has written, a rhyming recipe for almond tartlets. Cyrano notices that Lise is in deep conversation with the Musketeer. Cyrano reminds her that Ragueneau is his friend and that he will not tolerate her having an affair with the Musketeer. Cyrano signals to Ragueneau that it is time to leave him on his own, and Ragueneau ushers the poets into another room", "analysis": ""}
