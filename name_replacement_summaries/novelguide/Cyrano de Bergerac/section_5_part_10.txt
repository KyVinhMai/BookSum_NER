He adds that the wedding night will have to wait, a fact about which Cyrano is secretly relieved. Christian and Roxane say a tender farewell. Cyrano drags Christian away, promising Roxane that he will look after Christian. She asks Cyrano to make sure Christian does not look at any other women, and to make him write to her every day. Cyrano says he can definitely promise to fulfill this last request.", "analysis": "of Act 3, scenes 5-14. Christian's attempt to woo Roxane for himself is, predictably, a disaster. It is clear that he cannot fulfill her expectations, being unable to deliver anything beyond the simplest of platitudes, such as \"I love you. He only wants to kiss her, whereas she wants poetry and intellectual stimulation. Her disgust at his lack of intelligence is confirmation that it is not Christian's good looks that entrance her, but Cyrano's heartfelt words. If only Cyrano would take this message to heart, the outcome of the story would be quite different. Perhaps Cyrano is put off by Roxane's comment to Christian: \"I don't like you stupid, any more / Than I'd like you ugly. In his misplaced self-confidence that he can win Roxane on his own, Christian is the opposite of Cyrano, who, it could be said, has a misplaced humility. Further evidence of Cyrano's heroism emerges from these scenes. Just as Cyrano previously rescued Ragueneau from hanging himself, here, he rescues Christian from losing Roxane forever. His physical movement from standing under Roxane's balcony to pushing Christian underneath the balcony and standing in front of it is symbolic of his greater right to be Roxane's lover. There is immense pathos in Cyrano's eloquent and passionate speech to Roxane in the persona of Christian. It is clear that he has never before revealed what is in his heart, and Christian's usurpation of his friend's words to claim the kiss appears as a tragic injustice. It is impossible to blame Christian, however, since the plan was entirely Cyrano's. Roxane's ploy in pretending to read out an order for her to marry Christian in de Guiche's letter can be seen as further proof of her intelligence and skill at persuading people to fall in with her plans, though some critics point out that it also shows a tendency to deception and manipulation. Like Cyrano, she is an active mover of events rather than a passive onlooker or victim. Cyrano shows yet more proof of his persuasive skills when he successfully distracts de Guiche with his inventive story about falling from the moon. Cyrano enchants de Guiche against his will, preventing him from disrupting the wedding. Christian, in contrast with Cyrano and Roxane, tends to be more passive, which is another way in which he seems less worthy of Roxane than does Cyrano. There is dramatic irony in de Guiche's determination to send Christian to war before his wedding night. On one level, this is the malicious act of the stage villain, opposing the love of the innocent young couple. But on another level, unknown to de Guiche and the young couple, it is in tune with Cyrano's wishes  and with the underlying subtext of the play, which decrees that Cyrano, not Christian, is the rightful lover and husband of Roxane. Cyrano's promise to Roxane that Christian will write to her every day tells the audience that Cyrano's proxy courtship of Roxane will continue. The balcony scene is a deliberate parody of the balcony scene in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In Shakespeare's play, the handsome and intelligent Romeo stands beneath Juliet's balcony and the two declare their love for each other. The fact that in Cyrano de Bergerac there are two incomplete lovers, one of whom provides the face and the other the words, adds to the comedy of the play and comments humorously on the felt inadequacies that frequently torture lovers"}
