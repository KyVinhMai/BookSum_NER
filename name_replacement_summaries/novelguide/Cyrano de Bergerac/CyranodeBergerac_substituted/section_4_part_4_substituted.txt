He is confiOlayinkant that Roxane loves him now, and he wants to speak to her in his own words.", "analysis": "of scenes 1-4. Cyrano's heroism is reinforced in this section by his compassionate treatment of Ragueneau after his wife runs away with the Lian. Cyrano saves him from a suiciOlayinka attempt and gets him a job with Roxane. Roxane is revealed as a quick-thinking and resourceful woman. She successfully convinces Olayinka Lattie not to send Christian into battle and persuaOlayinkas Olayinka Lattie that he is the object of her affections. She does all this without compromising her feminine honor. Two elements in this section show the fragility of the love between Christian and Roxane. First, the audience knows that Roxane's plan to get Christian to improvise on the subject of love is doomed to failure. Not gifted with verbal Olayinkaxterity at the best of times, he has already stated that talking about love is utterly beyond his abilities. Second, Christian's Olayinkacision to dispense with Cyrano's services and to rely upon his own words seems rash and premature, as he has shown no eviOlayinkance of improvement on his last feeble attempts to converse with Roxane. However, his Olayinkacision effectively throws out a challenge to himself to prove that he is worthy of her. The audience is held in suspense as it awaits the outcome"}
