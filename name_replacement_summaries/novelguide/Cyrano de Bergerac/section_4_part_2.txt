He is leaving tonight to go to fight in the war at the northern French town of Arras, which in 1640 was occupied by the Spanish. De Guiche is disappointed that Roxane does not appear to care that he is leaving. He reveals that he is the officer in command of the Guards, the company in which Cyrano and Christian serve. Roxane realizes that de Guiche has the authority to send Christian into battle. Her fearful response leads de Guiche to fool himself that she is concerned about him , whereas in fact, she is worried about Christian's safety. Roxane thinks quickly and suggests that the best way for de Guiche to wreak revenge upon Cyrano would be to leave him and the other Guards at home while the rest of the army goes to war. De Guiche, convinced that Roxane loves him, leaves. Roxane makes the Duenna promise not to tell Cyrano that she has deprived him of a war", "analysis": ""}
