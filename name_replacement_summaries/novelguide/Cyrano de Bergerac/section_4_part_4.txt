He is confident that Roxane loves him now, and he wants to speak to her in his own words.", "analysis": "of scenes 1-4. Cyrano's heroism is reinforced in this section by his compassionate treatment of Ragueneau after his wife runs away with the Musketeer. Cyrano saves him from a suicide attempt and gets him a job with Roxane. Roxane is revealed as a quick-thinking and resourceful woman. She successfully convinces de Guiche not to send Christian into battle and persuades de Guiche that he is the object of her affections. She does all this without compromising her feminine honor. Two elements in this section show the fragility of the love between Christian and Roxane. First, the audience knows that Roxane's plan to get Christian to improvise on the subject of love is doomed to failure. Not gifted with verbal dexterity at the best of times, he has already stated that talking about love is utterly beyond his abilities. Second, Christian's decision to dispense with Cyrano's services and to rely upon his own words seems rash and premature, as he has shown no evidence of improvement on his last feeble attempts to converse with Roxane. However, his decision effectively throws out a challenge to himself to prove that he is worthy of her. The audience is held in suspense as it awaits the outcome"}
