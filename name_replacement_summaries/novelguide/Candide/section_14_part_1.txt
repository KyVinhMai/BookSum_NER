Martin, of course, is skeptical. Next speaking to Cacambo, Candide learns that Cunegonde too is a slave, working as a dishwasher, and ugly to boot. Candide, however, says that he doesn't care what she looks like, as long as he can see her again. Walking about on ship, Candide spies two convicts who bear a remarkable resemblance to Cunegonde's brother, the baron, and Dr. Pangloss, both thought to be dead. Getting closer, he realizes that indeed it is them, alive, though not well. Motioning to the captain, Candide arranges to pay for their release", "analysis": ""}
