For example, his paintings by Rafael don't please him, Homer bores him and he finds neither the writing of Virgil, Horace or Milton very great.

Yet when Martin challenges his thesis, Candide admits that perhaps only he himself is optimistic at the prospect of again seeing Cunegonde", "analysis": ""}
