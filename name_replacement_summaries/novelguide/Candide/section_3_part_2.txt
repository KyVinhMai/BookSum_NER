This event, like the earthquake which preceded it, actually occurred in Lisbon during the summer of 1756. Also connected with Candide's auto-da-fe is the Inquisition, replete with human sacrifices. Soon Candide and Pangloss find themselves under the category of human sacrifices, having been arrested for the comical charge that one was talking and the other \"listening with an air of approval. Though Pangloss is hanged , Candide, luckily, is only flogged \"in cadence to the music. This savage pageantry is used by Voltaire to underscore the intolerance and injustice of the Church through its brutal treatment of innocent victims, like Candide, though it maintains the false exquisiteness of tradition. It's interesting to note that a second earthquake struck the city only a few hours later. All this causes Candide to seriously question the optimistic way of thinking, as he seems to be approaching death before an old woman mysteriously appears to aid him", "analysis": ""}
