Once he has recovered enough to see visitors, the woman leads him to a nearby house where he meets, of all people, Cunegonde. His lover is elated to see him, explaining that although she was close to death, she ultimately survived the attacks of the Bulgar soldiers. Candide also relates his story, which proves quite touching to Cunegonde", "analysis": ""}
