{"name": "Chapter 9", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210213005525/https://www.novelguide.com/candide/summaries/chapter-9-10", "summary": "Seeing what he believes to be another competitor for Cunegonde's love, the Jew attacks Candide, forcing the pupil of optimism to kill him with a sword. After Issachar's death, Candide wishes that Pangloss were there to give him advice, but settles for the opinion of the old woman in his stead. Before she can give her counsel, however, the Grand Inquisitor enters for his nightly visit, forcing Candide to kill him as well. Quickly the old woman details the plan of their escape-that they will take what gold and diamonds they can lay their hands on, and then they should flee the estate on the backs of three horses. When the Holy Brotherhood, an organization with both Church and State powers, enters the household to bury their holy Inquisitor and fling Issachar onto a dunghill, the three fugitives are gone. In this chapter, Voltaire obviously continues his onslaught of criticism for the Catholic Church, showing the Inquisitor to be nothing more than a worldly womanizer. He also stereotypes Don Issachar, portraying him as a greedy, selfish money-grubber who hopes to buy himself earthly happiness", "analysis": ""}
