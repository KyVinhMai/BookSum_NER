Becoming the prisoner-of-war of a certain, \"attractive\" Bulgar captain, she lives in a sort of quasi-bondage for three months, at which time he trades her to a wealthy Jew named Don Issachar. When the Inquisitor sees Cunegonde at Mass, he immediately threatens the Jew, finally forcing him to agree to turn over his house and Cunegonde, his sex-slave, one-half of the week.

Cunegonde quickly instructs her maid, the old woman, to fetch Candide, which she does. At the end of the chapter, Don Issachar, the part-time owner of the estate, enters to \"assert his rights and express his tender passion", "analysis": ""}
