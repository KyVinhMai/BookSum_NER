Candide is shocked and horrified to see his teacher in such a state, but immediately asks about his beloved Cunegonde. When Pangloss explains that she has been killed, Candide passes out. Upon awakening, he muses, \"Ah, best of worlds, what's become of you now.

For example, if Columbus had never sailed to America, chocolate wouldn't exist to tantalize the taste buds of cultured Europeans. Fortunately for Pangloss, Jacques, the \"charitable anabaptist,\" pays to cure the teacher of his disease, though the philosopher loses one eye and one ear in the process. When Jacques confronts Pangloss' systemic philosophy, however, he responds, \". private misfortunes make for public welfare", "analysis": ""}
