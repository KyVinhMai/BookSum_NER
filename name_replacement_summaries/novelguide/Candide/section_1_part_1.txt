Candide, which means optimism, is the first character introduced, and Voltaire explains that he is the Baron's nephew. Though Candide has respectable parents, he is a bastard by birth, yet still seems to be a part of the noble palace family. He is said to be honest, simple-hearted and gentle. Other members of the palace include the Baron of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh, the head of the castle, and his overweight wife, the Baroness. Together, the two have Cunegonde, a gorgeous seventeen-year-old princess, a son, and the esteemed palace tutor, Pangloss, who teaches that everything is for the best and that man lives in the \"best of all possible worlds. It seems Dr. Pangloss is quite versed in \"experimental physics,\" for one day Cunegonde spies the tutor \"giving a lesson\" to her mother's \"attractive and obedient\" maidservant in the bushes. This inspires Cunegonde to yearn to practice this art with Candide. When the two young lovers do engage in this kind of science, however, they are caught in the act, and Candide is expelled from the castle permanently", "analysis": ""}
