Next, Candide muses to himself, oddly enough, that he wishes Pangloss were present so that he could \"politely\" object to his master's optimistic philosophy. This brief admission is very significant, for it marks a serious change in Candide's already shifting belief in optimism. After reaching Buenos Aires, Candide and company quickly encounter the governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueoa y Mascarenes y Campourdos y Souza. Voltaire purposefully exaggerates his name in order to satirize the man, and the presumptuousness of the nobility in general. It soon becomes evident that the governor, as expected, is rude and arrogant, as he aggressively pursues Cunegonde's hand in marriage after merely seeing the girl's beauty. Startled by the sudden arrival of the police, hot on Candide's trail, the old woman urges Cunegonde to earn a life of luxury by marrying the governor", "analysis": ""}
