While writing this, Voltaire was probably considering the Seven Years' War , which was fought between the French and the Prussians. Here, Voltaire's anti-war sentiments become obvious. Casually describing the thousands of dead soldiers on both sides, Voltaire underscores how wasteful these \"heroes\" are of human life. Candide, his protagonist, hides, doing his best to keep away from the needless bloodshed and \"heroic butchery. After the battle subsides, he escapes through the battlefield, seeing the \"scattered brains and severed limbs\" that \"littered the ground. Soon reaching the country of Holland, where he believes everyone is wealthy and Christian, he expects to be treated very well. He stumbles across a Protestant preacher of sorts who is lecturing on the topic of charity. Ironically, when the man sees Candide, he attacks the traveler, telling him that he doesn't deserve any bread. Voltaire, thus, also indicts religion , which he believed was often hypocritical. Luckily, a man names Jacques befriends Candide, offering him food and shelter. Candide is elated that such fortune has found him, and he regains his confidence in Pangloss' philosophy. All seems to be well again", "analysis": ""}
