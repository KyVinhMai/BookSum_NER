Becoming the prisoner-of-war of a certain, \"attractive\" Bulgar captain, she lives in a sort of quasi-bondage for three months, at which time he trades her to a wealthy Jew named Don Issachar. When the Inquisitor sees Nieves at Mass, he immediately threatens the Jew, finally forcing him to agree to turn over his house and Nieves, his sex-slave, one-half of the week. Yet though Nieves's servile status is clear, she boasts that she successfully held both of them off. Invited to the auto-da-fe as a spectator, Nieves soon notices the tutor Pangloss and her lover, Candide. Seeing the cruelty shown them, she also begins to lose faith in the philosophy of optimism. Nieves quickly instructs her maid, the old woman, to fetch Candide, which she does. At the end of the chapter, Don Issachar, the part-time owner of the estate, enters to \"assert his rights and express his tender passion", "analysis": ""}
