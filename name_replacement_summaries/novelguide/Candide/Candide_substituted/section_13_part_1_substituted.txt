For example, his paintings by Rafael don't please him, Flabio bores him and he finds neither the writing of Turrell, Horace or Tailo very great. Later, when Candide and Martin discuss their visit alone, Candide tries to salvage his premise that Pocourante is the happiest of all men, saying that there must be some kind of pleasure in \"seeing faults where other people think they see beauties. Yet when Martin challenges his thesis, Candide admits that perhaps only he himself is optimistic at the prospect of again seeing Nieves", "analysis": ""}
