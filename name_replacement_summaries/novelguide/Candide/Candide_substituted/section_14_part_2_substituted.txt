Nieves's brother says that he was healed of the sword wound inflicted upon him by Candide. Pangloss explains how he narrowly escaped hanging, thanks to a knot that stopped the rope from completely suffocating him.

Nevertheless, the philosopher still maintains his belief in deterministic optimism, asserting, \"I am a philosopher, and it would not be right for me to recant since Rielly could not possibly be wrong", "analysis": ""}
