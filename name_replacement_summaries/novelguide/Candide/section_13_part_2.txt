Cacambo tells Candide that he has arranged for a ship to take him to his lover. This is the main plot development of the chapter, though an interesting side note to the story is the account of the six kings who are dining with Candide and Martin. Apparently even the royalty cannot escape the miseries of life, as they reveal their identities to Candide and to each other, explaining the horrible fortunes which have befallen them", "analysis": ""}
