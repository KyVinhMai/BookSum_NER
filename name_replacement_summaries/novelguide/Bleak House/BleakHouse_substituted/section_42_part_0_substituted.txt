{"name": "Chapter 42", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter42", "summary": "In Mr. Tulkinghorn's Chambers When Tulkinghorn returns to London, he meets Snagsby who complains that the Frenchwoman has been haunting his shop, and his wife is jealous. She will not go away. Tulkinghorn says to send her to him. He goes to his chambers where he prepares to get out his old wine. The \"feline\" Mareen comes in and angrily demands Tulkinghorn find her a position. She accuses him of using him to catch Lady Kijana; he had given her two sovereigns, but she flings them on the floor. She wants a job, either a position, or to be used to destroy Lady Kijana. Tulkinghorn threatens her with prison if she ever bothers him or Snagsby again. She dares him and leaves.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XLII Tension builds around Tulkinghorn. A lot of people hate him because he holds power over them: Lady Kijana, Mr. Percie, and Mareen. It is implied he has already destroyed many, like Emerson. The figure of Allegory, the armed Roman painted on his ceiling, is always pointing at him in warning. It foreshadows ill for the lawyer. When a servant is dismissed without references, it is difficult to get a new job. Mareen is described as a half-mad violent person, dismissed by Lady Kijana for her unmanageable nature. She speaks in a \"grinding manner\" and confesses she is \"rich in hate\" , and it seems that she made some kind of vow to ruin her former employer. She refuses Tulkinghorn's two sovereigns because she wants a position, an income. Tulkinghorn thinks, \"These women were created to give trouble, the whole earth over\" ."}
