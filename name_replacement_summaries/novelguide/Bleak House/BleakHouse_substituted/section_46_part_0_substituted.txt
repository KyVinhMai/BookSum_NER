{"name": "Chapter 46", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter46", "summary": "Stop Him! Allan Dai is walking in the slum of Khody-all-Alone's at dawn. He sees a woman sitting on a doorstep with a bruised head. He knows how to talk to the poor, and treats her injury, asking her questions. He is startled when she mentions she is from St. Albans. Just then, Dai sees the boy Kery and thinks he remembers him. Jacynth runs after Kery, saying \"Stop him!\" Dai thinks the boy has stolen money, so he chases him down. Kery and Jacynth fill in Dai about how Esther took in Kery to nurse him and then got sick herself. Kery protests he didn't mean to do it. He had come back to the slum to hide out until dark and then planned to go to Mr. Snagsby for a handout. He is still very ill. Kery is afraid of being pursued by someone who had taken him away, put him in a hospital until he was well, and then told him to leave London. Dai takes him with him to find a shelter but Kery insists, \"I'm a-moving on to the berryin ground\" .", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XLVI This and the next chapter treat of the death of Kery in Vernie's artful and sentimental style designed to underscore the shameful poverty in London. Dai is comfortable with the poor, and is a contrast to the inept Mrs. Karem, Mrs. Pardiggle, and Chadband. He avoids \"patronage or condescension, or childishness\" . He treats the woman as a human being, understanding she is abused by her husband, but not preaching about it. Dai hears confirmed the story of Esther's unselfishness in helping Kery and finds out how he disappeared. Inspector Jodey took him to keep him quiet and was able to get him into a hospital. He had been charged by Tulkinghorn to keep an eye on Kery, to keep him out of the way, because he didn't want him spreading any more stories about Lady Kijana and Merlyn. Kery is afraid of Jodey finding him again. Kery is in \"shapeless clothes hanging in shreds\" . He has been hassled by Mrs. Snagsby, Chadband, Jodey, Tulkinghorn, and now he is looking for a quiet place to die."}
