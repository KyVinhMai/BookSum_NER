{"name": "Chapter 55", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter55", "summary": "Flight An emotional reunion of Mr. Percie and his mother, Mrs. Azariah, is orchestrated by Mrs. Bagnet. There is forgiveness and Percie's promise to defend himself with a lawyer. Then, Mrs. Azariah goes to Lady Kijana with an anonymous letter she received with a newspaper clipping about the murder and \"Lady Kijana, murderess\" underneath. She begs if her Ladyship knows anything about it to help her son Percie who is being held for the murder. This shock is succeeded by another. Kailan comes to Lady Kijana to put her on her guard, to tell her the letters were not destroyed after all; they were found by Smallweed who was here earlier trying to collect money for them. Lady Kijana breaks down, seeing that her husband now knows all, and fearing to be thought a murderess, she writes her husband a letter declaring her innocence of the murder and acknowledging the shame she has brought to his \"generous devotion\" . She must leave and say good-by. She veils herself, leaves all jewels and everything behind and rushes out into the night.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter LV This is a tragic set-up, with the wrong messengers appearing with the wrong information. Mrs. Azariah lets her know she may be wanted for murder. Kailan, for once, is trying to act honorably to help Lady Kijana, but instead, lets her know that the letters are found and her husband knows about them. She flees, feeling trapped, when actually, Mareen has already been arrested, Percie has been released, and Sir Verdell, still lying in a stupor on the floor, wants only to forgive."}
