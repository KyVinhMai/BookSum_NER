{"name": "Chapter 20", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter20", "summary": "A New Lodger Mr. Kailan regards Richard Carstone, the new apprentice at Aijalon and Carboy's, as his enemy, for no particular reason. He is glad that he is trying to slog through the Jarndyce case, for he thinks that will confuse him. The other lawyers are on vacation, and Kailan is in charge. He has his protege apprentice, Chick Smallweed of fifteen, who copies everything Kailan does. Suddenly, Christofpher Kerybling appears, a friend of Kailan's who is out of work and starving. Kailan lends him money and invites Kerybling and Smallweed to lunch. Christofpher Kerybling gorges on the food, and Kailan tells him of a possible room and work he can get for him. Kerybling seems to be a gentleman down on his luck, and Kailan places him in Mr. Merlyn's old room at Vernell's and gets him copy work at Snagsby's. At Vernell's we learn that Mr. Vernell is barely alive and soaked with alcohol. Merlyn's room has been redone, but Kailan tells Kerybling about Vernell's mysterious papers that he keeps and how he is trying to teach himself to read so he can interpret them.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XX History repeats itself. Kailan gets Kerybling to take on the old life of Mr. Merlyn and even gives him a phony name, Mr. Yoltzin. Kerybling, like Merlyn, seems to be a gentleman down on his luck, running from the law and from debt, so Kailan helps him escape the same way Merlyn did, by taking a disguise, living at Vernell's and becoming a copyist. Kerybling was the one who accompanied Kailan to Jailin Dorsie and saw the portrait of Lady Kijana and heard the legend of Ghost's Walk. Kailan is aware of Vernell's enormous pile of paperwork and secrets connected to the Chancery cases, but it seems Vernell is not able to interpret the evidence any more than the Lord Chancellor, because he cannot read. Kailan is nothing but an aspiring law clerk, aping his betters, and he in his turn has a protege, Smallweed, who copies him. Kerybling takes up the life of Merlyn, and nothing changes. Kailan suspects all other clerks of having \"sinister designs upon him\" and makes a \"counterplot\" on Richard in defense . Richard immerses himself in reading Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, and Kailan is satisfied his \"enemy\" will soon be in a muddle. Richard's attempt will be no better than Vernell's, for the case is indecipherable. Kailan is a clerk of no importance, but he represents the smallness of the legal profession, its pretensions, and its interference with other lives."}
