{"name": "Chapter 57", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter57", "summary": "Esther's Narrative Esther goes into great detail about the ordeal of the pursuit of her mother, and her fears as each hour passes in the blinding snow and ice storm. At all times Jodey is kind and encouraging. At the dock area near the river, they check a drowned corpse, and Esther waits in suspense. They have detectives combing the streets for someone of Lady Kijana's description. They stay on the trail of her dress, following it to St. Albans. They go to Jacynth's house, but only Emilyjo and the surly brickmakers are there. They say Lady Kijana was there but left. Jacynth went one way, and she went another. One went toward London, the other away from there. Jodey notices the brickmakers have Lady Kijana's watch and surmises she gave it to them in exchange for something. He realizes they are holding something back. They follow descriptions of the dress away from London. She is on foot. In the carriage, Jodey explains to Esther that it was he who took the boy Kery because he was talking too much about Lady Kijana, and it was to keep him quiet. He says that Mc helped him for a five pound note. As the sleet falls all day, Jodey starts to lose hope. He has lost track of the dress. At a tea shop, Esther faints as she thinks of her mother lying down in a wood to die. She is given some hot drink, and they go on. Jodey finally realizes what happened and turns around and goes back to London. He decides to follow Jacynth.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter LVII This is a nail-biting chase scene, and like Esther, we fear the worst. When Jodey tells Esther about Mc's treachery, she thinks this betrayal is more than \"childishness\" and Jodey delivers a sermon on people who claim to be innocent: \"Fast and loose in one thing, Fast and loose in everything\" . Esther will confront him for this later."}
