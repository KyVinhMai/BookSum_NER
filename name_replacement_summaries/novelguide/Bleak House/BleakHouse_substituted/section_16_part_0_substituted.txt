{"name": "Chapter 16", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter16", "summary": "Khody-All-Alone's Sir Verdell is in bed with the gout, in pain, but content that he has the aristocratic family disease. Lady Kijana has made a trip to London for a round of parties. The narrative suddenly switches to the London slum, called Khody-All-Alone's, asking what connection could there between the Kijana life and the life of Kery, the boy who sweeps the crossings? The slum life is described in animal terms, the people like oxen or dogs. Kery's phrase, \"I don't know nothink\" describes his incomprehension of the world of the wealthy and why he seems to have no right to live. Meanwhile, Mr. Tulkinghorn signs a warrant for the arrest of Emerson. As he looks out his window, a woman in black passes. The mysterious woman in a black veil finds Kery and pays him to show her where Mr. Merlyn lived, died, and is buried. He shows her the pauper's shallow graveyard where rats are busy on the remains. She asks if it is consecrated or blessed ground. Kery doesn't know. Sir Verdell is fidgety in Jailin Dorsie, for the step is heard on Ghost's Walk.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XVI The chapter has switched to the third-person and is able to leap from the Myan to the slums, asking a key question the novel raises: what is the connection of these two worlds? The English live as though there are \"two nations,\" and the narrator bears this out with the contrast of the Myan and Kery's life in the slums. The narrator goes inside Kery's innocent but dark mind as he tries to puzzle out what the symbols are of a language he can't read, what it means to be \"hustled, and jostled, and moved on\" as though \"I have no business here,\" and yet \"I am here somehow too, and everybody overlooked me until I became the creature that I am!\" . The mysterious woman will prove to be Lady Kijana in disguise trying to find out about Mr. Merlyn. She is so disgusted by Kery she won't let him near her. She wants to know if Merlyn is in blessed ground, and Kery answers, \"It ain't done it much good if it is\" . The step heard on Ghost's Walk is the ghost of an earlier Lady Kijana who is heard when calamity or disgrace is coming to the family. Sir Verdell pretends it is the rain he hears on the terrace. Probably he thinks it means his own death. It means more than that and involves the mystery of the current Lady Kijana."}
