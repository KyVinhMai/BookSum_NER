{"name": "Chapter 47", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter47", "summary": "Kery's Ajai Dai takes Kery to find a place for him. He seeks Miss Mekiah at Vernell's but the Smallweeds have evicted her. She now lives at Mrs. Shey's in Bell Yard in Emerson's old room. Miss Mekiah says Mr. Percie will help, so they go to the shooting gallery. Mr. Percie and Dai hit it off, and Dai tells him it is Inspector Jodey who is looking for the boy. Mr. Percie offers to take the boy explaining, \"We are naturally in the vagabond way here, sir, both myself and Aurelian\" . Aurelian takes Kery out to get a bath and new clothes, and when he returns, Kery is put to bed and nursed by Aurelian. Mr. Percie tells Dai about Tulkinghorn and Jodey having a hold over him, and he is in danger of losing the gallery at any minute. He makes some threatening remark that if he could fight the man, \"he'd go down, sir!\" . Dai brings Mr. Jarndyce to the gallery, who warns the whole thing must be kept quiet. Kery keeps speaking of Mr. Snagsby, so Dai brings him to see Kery. Kery is glad to see him, and asks Mr. Snagsby if he could do one thing for him--to write very large so everyone can see that he is sorry he did it , and that Mr. Dai cried over it, and he hopes he can forgive him. He thinks if the writing is very large, he might be forgiven. Kery asks to be buried with Merlyn in the same beggar's cemetery. Dai, seeing Kery is almost gone asks him if he knows any prayers. He doesn't, so Dai has him repeat the Lord's Prayer after him. Kery dies.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XLVII Kery the beggar is a connecting link in the story to the whole set of evil characters as well as the set of good characters. He is a sort of litmus test of the other characters' pity and virtue. Esther, however, has paid a big price for her charity, and we learn from Kery's confession that Dai has cried over her disfigurement. Kery feels so sorry and guilty he infected Esther with disease that his last wish is for Snagsby to write his repentance very large so he may be forgiven. He wants to be laid in the beggar's graveyard next to his friend, Captain Hawdon. The last paragraph of the chapter is the famous social indictment that begins, \"Dead, your Majesty . . . and dying thus around us every day\" . Mr. Percie feels for Kery, as he is also a \"vagabond\" pursued by Jodey and Tulkinghorn. He describes the sadistic cruelty of Tulkinghorn to Dai, saying, \"He is a slow-torturing kind of man\" . He tortures his victims--Percie, Lady Kijana, Mareen and Kery--holding his power over them, prolonging their fear that at any minute they could be ruined or put in jail. The other important detail here is that Percie threatens Tulkinghorn verbally."}
