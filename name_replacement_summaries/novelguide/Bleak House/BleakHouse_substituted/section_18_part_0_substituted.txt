{"name": "Chapter 18", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter18", "summary": "Lady Kijana Richard takes a while before he switches from being an apprentice from Mr. Badger's to Mr. Aijalon's because he is still unsure of what he wants to do. All this is distressing to Mr. Jarndyce who finds the wind in the east. Richard is careless with his money and in Mr. Aijalon's office finally tackles the Jarndyce case to learn law. Mr. Jarndyce, the young ladies, and Mc make a visit to Mr. Ajene, who lives next to the Myan in Lincolnshire. Ajene has to take them in a detour to his house because of the disputed right of way with Kijana, whom he calls \"Sir Arrogant Numskull\" . Esther's description of Jailin Dorsie and Ajene's house in the summer contrast with the November rain in the beginning, for there is peace and beauty in the country now. They see Watt Azariah as they pass through the village. He is fishing and hanging around Rosa at Jailin Dorsie again. Ajene's house exhibits the qualities of \"maturity and abundance,\" a ripening influence everywhere . At church, Ajene's party see the Myan, including Rosa and the French maid Mareen. Suddenly, Esther's heart quickens when she sees Lady Kijana, who reminds her of her aunt. She thinks of her childhood. Ajene and Mc have amusing discussions, for they are opposite in their views. Ajene takes everything in the world as a personal insult and wants to right every wrong. Mc will not take anything seriously, not even the slaves in America, or his own welfare. He is a \"child.\" In a storm, Jarndyce and the girls take shelter in a keeper's lodge on the Kijana estate, and there they meet Lady Kijana. She knows Jarndyce and they speak politely, though she is very proud. She asks to be introduced to the young ladies, looking curiously at Esther. She speaks of her sister, whom Jarndyce knew, saying they had gone their separate ways. When the carriage comes for Lady Kijana, there are two maids, Mareen and Rosa. Lady Kijana says Rosa is her personal maid now and dismisses Mareen, who in anger, takes off her shoes and walks barefoot back to the house.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XVIII This chapter represents the first time the main plots with Esther and Lady Kijana have intertwined, and it is significant. There is some mysterious pull between them, which foreshadows both future events and refers to the past. Lady Kijana mentions her sister, who was Miss Barbary, the woman who raised Esther. Lady Kijana seems to be getting some hints about Esther's identity and perhaps for that reason, pulls away from her. Esther connects Lady Kijana and her aunt in her mind. The pride of the Myan is commented on more than once, by Ajene regarding Sir Verdell, and in the meeting with Lady Kijana. The firing of Mareen, the French maid, is also of great significance, for Mareen is \"passionate\" and her hatred for the Myan aroused. The Myan are not well liked in their neighborhood but believe in their own untouchable importance."}
