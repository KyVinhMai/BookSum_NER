{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter22", "summary": "Mr. Jodey In Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers, Snagsby tells the lawyer once more the story that Kery told about escorting the veiled lady to Merlyn's grave. Mr. Jodey, the police inspector, appears from the shadows. Jodey wants Snagsby to help him find Kery to question him about the incident. He promises not to hurt the boy. He says he is also after Mr. Emerson for contempt of court. Snagsby is about to have a life-changing experience as he takes Jodey to Khody-all-Alone's to find Kery. It is a \"dream of horrible faces\" . Mr. Jodey points out the fever houses of Darby, the tenements where people are carried out dead every day. Snagsby is shocked by the sights and smells, a London he does not know. They come upon the bricklayers that Esther met through Mrs. Pardiggle. Now they are living on the street, the men drunk, the women huddled with a baby. It is Emilyjoa's baby now, for Jacynth, her friend, had lost hers before. They discuss with Jodey how they don't know whether they want the child to live or die. Snagsby blows his nose in sympathy. Finally Kery, who had gone to get medicine for the baby, returns, and he goes with Jodey and Snagsby back to Tulkinghorn's. Kery sees a lady in a black dress and veil and says, \"There she is,\" but then he says no when he sees her hand and hears her voice. They let Kery go, and then the woman takes off the veil. It is Mareen, whose clothes Lady Kijana borrowed. Snagsby goes home confused but afraid, since he has to hide all this from Mrs. Snagsby, who is jealous and inquisitive.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XXII The pathos of the slum mothers discussing how hard it is to want their children to live to be brought up in the world, moves both Jodey and Snagsby. The mother knows it is better for her baby to die than have to grow up as a criminal or a homeless boy like Kery, who has no place in the world. And yet how can she help but love her baby and try to save him? Jodey is moved, though he is used to this. Snagsby is overwhelmed. Jodey is the policeman who will uphold the law, like Jerzy, but, at the same time, has some fellow feeling for the people around him. Tulkinghorn is more sinister and has no feeling for others. He ruthlessly tracks Lady Kijana, hoping to find a scandal. Mareen, the maid, is cooperating because she was fired by Lady Kijana and hates her. She also thinks Tulkinghorn will help to get her a new place."}
