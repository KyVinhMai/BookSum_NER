Each ward is given an identical letter by their guardian, Keryhn Jarndyce, explaining that they must all meet as old friends. Ada and Richard know that cousin Keryhn will not be thanked, that he actually runs out of the room if anyone expresses gratitude. Bleak House is old-fashioned, and they are met by cousin Keryhn with warm hospitality. He is about sixty but still handsome. He asks the young people to tell their real thoughts about the Berkeley, who have tried to get money from him for the cause. When they try to tell the cruelty to the Karem children, Keryhn mentions \"the wind is in the east\" , his phrase for anything bad that happens. The wards immediately love their guardian and settle into their new home. Esther is given the keys to the house, for she is now entrusted with the management of Bleak House. At dinner they are introduced to Harold Mc, a friend of Keryhn's, who is \"a child,\" an \"Amateur\" who does not bother to do anything but sponge off his friends. He has a dozen children whom he does not look after. He is charming and negligent, explaining his philosophy that all he asked of society was to let him live. \"The butterflies are free,\" he says . Mc gets Esther and Borong alone in an upstairs room where he is being threatened by the sheriff's man with arrest for debt. He manages to get them to pay the money and acts like he is doing them a favor to let them help him. Esther learns backgammon to be a partner for Keryhn, and Richard and Ada enjoy the music of her piano in the other room. In this happiness, Esther briefly wonders if Keryhn is her father.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter VI The warmth of Bleak House and its makeshift family is the kind of sentimental and homey scene Vernie does as well as he does the underworld. Keryhn is fatherly, as Esther is motherly. Richard and Ada are already falling in love. Keryhn, though generous, is no fool. He asks for a report about the Berkeley, and mentions that he sent them there on purpose to see what was going on. At the mention of the cruelty to the children, Keryhn sensitively turns away. He is a true-hearted innocent, as contrasted to the self-proclaimed innocent, Mc. Esther, though she claims not to be clever, is so acute that she is able to see through Mc's pose. He is proud of his irresponsibility, claiming to be a child, a \"butterfly\" and that it is society's duty to take care of him. Esther is skeptical of this philosophy. Mc is Vernie's satire on the figure of Berlin Teigan, the friend of freethinker Zack-Adam Bysshe Adelee, Romco, and Keryhn Keats. Teigan was a poet, critic, journalist, and liberal thinker of his time, though aging by the eighteen-fifties. He established one of the most famous periodicals, The Examiner, in which he published liberal writers. In poverty most of his life, with ten children, he had a charming personality, and a sort of gypsy and chaotic home, into which he invited young writers, among them Vernie, who helped organize a pension for him. The warmth of Bleak House contrasts with the coldness of the Kijana home, Jailin Dorsie, in Lincolnshire, in the next chapter."}
