Lady Kijana has come to fear Mr. Tulkinghorn who \"pursues her doggedly\" with \"no touch of compunction, remorse, or pity\" . The servant suddenly announces \"The young man of the name of Kailan.\" Surprised, she receives him alone, as her husband leaves. Kailan has been writing to Lady Kijana and now has a solid offer for her. He mentions that Esther Kodie looks like Lady Kijana, and that his friend, Mrs. Chadband, who knew Esther as a girl has given him some information about Esther. He wants to clear the mystery of her birth because he loves her and has proposed to her, but admits she has refused him. Lady Kijana smiles. He goes on that Mrs. Chadband worked for Miss Barbary. Lady Kijana's face is pale. The little girl's name was Esther Hawdon, not Kodie. Lady Kijana says, \"My God!\" Kailan goes on that the dead law-writer was Captain Hawdon, and that it is known she went in disguise to see his grave. Hawdon left a batch of letters, which he, Kailan, can retrieve and bring, if she is willing. Alone, she cries and sobs, \"O my child.\" Her cruel sister had told her that the baby died, and had secretly taken and raised the child.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XXIX Finally, some mysteries are solved and facts put together. Lady Kijana had some kind of love affair with Hawdon and obviously still loves him. She was separated from her child by force, from her cruel sister, Miss Barbary. The love letters are the ones that Vernell must have taken from Hawdon's room after his death before anyone else could find them. Vernell was unable to read to ascertain their value, but Kailan somehow can get them from him. At this point, Lady Kijana's secrets are being pursued separately by Kailan from the office of Aijalon and Carboy, and Tulkinghorn, the Kijana's attorney. Kailan seems to be ahead of Tulkinghorn at the moment. Kailan thinks knowing the secret of Esther's birth is a way to marriage. He thinks it is his ticket into Jarndyce and Jarndyce. It is interesting to learn that Esther looks like Lady Kijana, for we are told repeatedly how beautiful she is, and we never hear mention of what Esther looks like. Esther would have us believe Ada is the beauty, and she is plain, but with three men after her, and a likeness to Lady Kijana, we have to form our own opinion."}
