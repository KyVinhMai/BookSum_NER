Meanwhile, he travels north the industrial town where his brother owns iron factories. He looks up Mr. Azariah but calls himself, \"Steel.\" At first his brother is fooled, but then he recognizes Percie. The brothers joyfully reunite and make a visit home to find his son Watt and future daughter-in-law, Rosa, who will complete her education in Germany before getting married. Percie will give her away at the wedding. His brother offers him a job, but Percie says it isn't in his line. Percie wants to help Sir Verdell now, but his brother is scornful of his joining \"the household brigade\" . Percie finally shows his brother the letter he is sending Esther. It is the letter of her father's that he had given Tulkinghorn. He tells Esther that if he had known her father was alive, he would have shared his last farthing with him, but he had been reported dead.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter LXIII We get a few more details about the letter Percie had to give to Tulkinghorn from Captain Hawdon. It implies once more that if Hawdon had come back, Honoria would have married him instead of Sir Verdell. He was reported dead, and so she married someone else. Percie's simplicity and loyalty seem perfect for Sir Verdell at this time in his life, when all he has are his retainers around him to remind him of his once great house. Percie too is happy at Jailin Dorsie, the terrain of his boyhood, with his long lost mother. The elder brother is one of the new breed of businessmen who climbed out of a lower class and created his own higher rank, a self-made man who is his own boss. Percie is an old trooper who doesn't mind taking orders if he has a place."}
