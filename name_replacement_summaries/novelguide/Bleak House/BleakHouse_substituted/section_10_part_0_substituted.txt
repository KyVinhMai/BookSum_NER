{"name": "Chapter 10", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter10", "summary": "The Law Writer This chapter returns to third-person and describes the Law-Stationer's shop in Cook's Court, London, bordering Chancery Lane. Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby run the shop, though Mrs. Snagsby is the real boss. Mr. Snagsby rarely says a word. A crow's length away from Snagsby is Mr. Tulkinghorn, the lawyer, living by himself in a big old house with the figure of Allegory, a Roman soldier, painted on the ceiling. The lawyer is described as \"an Jaton of the old school\" . Mr. Tulkinghorn goes to Mr. Snagsby and asks him to identify the law-copier who wrote the Jarndyce document he has with him. Snagsby looks at his records and says it is done by Merlyn who lives at Vernell's. Mr. Tulkinghorn goes to Vernell's and asks to see Merlyn. Vernell tells him the rumor that Merlyn has sold himself to the devil. Tulkinghorn goes to his room and finds Merlyn dead from an overdose of opium.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter X The fainting of Lady Kijana over the writing on the document is somehow connected to this man Merlyn who has died from opium. Tulkinghorn notes that Merlyn means \"No man\" in Latin. Merlyn is an anonymous and grubby law copyist, in poverty, about forty-five, which is the age of Lady Kijana. Tulkinghorn, desirous of knowing the family secrets, is following out his lead, perhaps connected to whatever Kailan was looking for at the Kijana mansion. Tulkinghorn's epithet is \"oyster of the old school,\" meaning, he knows how to find and keep secrets without talking, but perhaps using them to his advantage."}
