{"name": "Chapter 49", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter49", "summary": "Dutiful Friendship It is Mrs. Bagnet's birthday party, and her family cook dinner for her. Mr. Percie shows up to drink a birthday toast as he always does, but Mrs. Bagnet sees there is something wrong. Percie admits he is sad because Kery had just died the day before. It reminds him of Emerson's death, and of Tulkinghorn who was responsible, \"a flinty old rascal\" . Just then Inspector Jodey shows up at the party, saying he is interested in buying a musical instrument. He charms the Bagnets, plays with the children, drinks a toast, but Percie remains sour. Jodey asks if there is any way out of the yard. Mrs. Bagnet says no. After an evening of fun, in which the Bagnets invite the Inspector for next year's party, Jodey walks out with Mr. Percie and away from the Bagnets, he arrests Percie for murdering Tulkinghorn. Percie is surprised but goes quietly and peacefully.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XLIX Jodey is a comic character who represents the law and pursues his victims, but with sympathy and compassion. Here, he refuses to ruin Mrs. Bagnet's birthday party and actually joins in, the life of the party. He arrests Mr. Percie as a likely suspect because he has been seen around Tulkinghorn's place, arguing with him, and open about his hatred of the man. Jodey asks him for his alibi, and Percie admits he was at Tulkinghorn's about the time of the murder. He does not object or defend himself. Vernie uses the plot strategy of all murder mysteries. He sets up several characters with motives for the murder, but doesn't show who did it. Almost always, the wrong person is arrested first. Mr. Percie is direct with his feelings, but does not act like a murderer, yet he is docile when arrested. The reader is equally surprised at his arrest, because we believe it was Lady Kijana. Now it seems there could have been more than one person waiting for Tulkinghorn to come home."}
