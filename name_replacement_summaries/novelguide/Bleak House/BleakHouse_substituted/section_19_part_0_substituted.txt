{"name": "Chapter 19", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126184952/https://www.novelguide.com/bleak-house/summaries/chapter19", "summary": "Moving On In the long summer vacation of four months, the Courts of Law and Equity are shut up and everyone on vacation. At Mr. Snagsby's house, they are getting ready for company, with Merion the maid dropping things and causing a clatter. Mr. Chadband, the minister, and his wife, have come to tea. Chadband speaks in a booming prophetic voice, an Apostle, full of cliches. They are interrupted by a constable who holds the street boy, Kery, claiming he has money on him, and they suspect him of stealing. Kery has given Snagsby as a reference. The constable tells him he has to \"move on.\" Mr. Kailan comes in and hears Kery's testimony that he was given the coin by a mysterious lady. Snagsby says the boy is innocent. Snagsby invites Kailan to tea where he hears Mrs. Chadband , tell about her former life as a housekeeper for Miss Barbary and the child Esther Kodie. Kailan perks up at the name of his beloved. Chadband uses the boy Kery as a subject to sermonize upon for his dark ignorance, and Kery wants nothing more than to \"move on.\"", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter XIX The obnoxious Kailan is everywhere, getting bits and pieces of stories, pieces of one big puzzle. He hears Kery's story about Lady Kijana's visit to the slums and the story of Esther's childhood. As we will see in the next chapter, he continues to make connections with people and places that have to do with a central mystery tying in to the Jarndyce case. Chadband is another parody of self-important religious people, who like Mrs. Pardiggle, make useless statements about the poor. The title of the chapter comes from the constable's warning to street people to \"move on\" and not loiter. The narrator makes a comment that it is ironic for the poor to have to move on, while Parliament does not. Poor Kery says, \"I've always been a-moving and a-moving on, ever since I was born\" . Kery is one of the homeless of London. Chadband tells him he is in darkness because he is in sin."}
