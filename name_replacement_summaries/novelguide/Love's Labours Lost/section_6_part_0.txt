He sees someone coming and ducks into a hiding place observing the newcomer who turns out to be the King. The King too, professes his love to the air, not knowing that one of his followers is listening. Ferdinand has fallen for the Princess of France and reads poetry aloud that he wrote for her. He hears someone, and hides when Longaville enters and does the same as both Berowne and the King. Finally, Dumaine enters and Longaville hides. While listening to his protestations of love, Longaville comes forward and chastises Dumaine. The King then comes forward and does the same to Longaville. Finally, Berowne shows himself and berates all three of the men. During his speech however, Costard and Jaquenetta enter and bring the letter Berowne wrote to Rosaline. Berowne, realizing the mistake, takes the letter and tears it up stating it was no more than a mere joke. The other lords see the letter and realize it is his handwriting. Berowne, too, then confesses his love and the men decide how to handle their predicament. Instead of hating themselves, Berowne explains to them that their love is normal, and the best thing to do is to win the women's love in return. They make plans and set out to please the unsuspecting ladies.", "analysis": ""}
