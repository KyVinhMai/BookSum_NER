Edgar, not wanting his father to die, tricks him into thinking they are at the cliff. Gloucester throws himself on the ground, and Edgar revives him saying that he fell off the cliff and still lived, so the gods must want it that way. They begin walking and Lear runs into them spouting gibberish. Some of his sayings have reason to them, but others are pure madness. Men enter and try to take the king to his daughter, but he refuses to go. They hear an army in the distance, and Edgar takes Gloucester's hand so he can lead him to safety. Oswald enters baring a sword and Edgar steps between him and Gloucester. To protect his father he ends up killing the messenger, who on his death says to deliver his letters to Edmund. Edgar reads the letter in which Goneril plots with Edmund to kill her husband. Edgar, wanting to help in the fighting, takes his father to a safe place where someone can watch over him", "analysis": ""}
