He brought her a bottle of wine, and accepted a cup of tea from her. As they were sitting around the round table, Mr. Bumble kept scooting his chair closer to the old woman. Finally, he grabbed and kissed her. Then came a knock at the door, and the beadle pretended to be doing something away from the matron, while the visitor entered. An old woman from the workhouse came in to tell Mrs. Corney that another woman was dying and was requesting her presence. Mrs. Corney left with the woman, and the beadle waited by looking at her silverware and china", "analysis": ""}
