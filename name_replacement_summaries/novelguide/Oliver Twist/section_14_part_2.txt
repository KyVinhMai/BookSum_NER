Nancy put on her bonnet and prepared to go out, but Sikes stopped her. They began fighting, and finally Sikes won and she did not go out. Fagin thought it peculiar that she would throw such a fit about taking a walk so he assumed that she had another lover, or was sick of Sikes brutality. Fagin decides that he needs Nancy to become more closely allied with himself, and wants to ask her to poison Sikes", "analysis": ""}
