The proof of Oliver's parentage had been destroyed, and Monks referred to the boy as his brother and wanted Oliver's identity to forever remain a secret. Nancy revealed that she was the woman who had stolen Oliver out of the street long ago, and Rose tried to convince her to stay and be protected. Nancy declined, saying that she must get back so she could take care of Sikes who she hinted at being in love with.
