They went down the steps at the side so they could talk without being seen, and Noah went down the other side to listen to their conversation. Nancy told them the appearance of Monks and the others, and where to find them. Rose stated that she recognized the Monks as the one seen with Fagin at the window by Oliver. Nancy makes them swear that no harm will come to her friends, and they say that they only want to get their hands on Monks. Mr. Brownlow offers again to help Rose but she declines. They leave, and soon after, Noah leaves to go report his story to Fagin", "analysis": ""}
