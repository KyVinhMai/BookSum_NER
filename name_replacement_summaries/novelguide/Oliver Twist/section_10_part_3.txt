That night however, she began crying during her playing, and Mrs. Maylie and Oliver were very distressed. Rose ended up falling very ill, and they feared she was going to die. Mrs. Maylie gave Oliver a letter to deliver into the nearest town that would bring Dr. Losberne to them. Oliver was exceptionally saddened that he might lose Rose, and was grateful he could do something to help. He delivered the letter to the innkeeper who dispatched a man with it right away. On Oliver's way back to the house, he ran into a strange man that began shouting at him. The man said that Oliver was haunting him, and Oliver left as quickly as possible. He prayed earnestly for Rose, and the next night Losberne came to help them. After he examined her, he told them there was little hope for her survival. Oliver prayed harder and spent time in the cemetery watching a funeral. When he returned, he was told that if Rose woke up from the sleep she had gone into, then she would experience a full recovery. Otherwise she would die. The next morning, Dr. Losberne came downstairs with the news that Rose had awakened, and everyone rejoiced the news", "analysis": ""}
