Monks real name is Edward Leeford and Mr. Brownlow was a close friend of his father, Mr. Leeford. As a child, Mr. Leeford was forced to marry a woman who he despised and she was the mother of Edward. Due to the hatred between them, Edward and his mother went to France. After they had gone, Leeford met a military man who moved to his district and fell in love with his daughter. She was the mother of Oliver, and Leeford painted a portrait of her and gave it to Brownlow. Leeford ended up receiving a large inheritance, and his wife and son Edward came back to Paris to help him claim it. Unfortunately, he died suddenly seemingly without a will. The truth, Mr. Brownlow said however, was that Edward and his mother had burned the will and moved with the money to the West Indies. This was why Brownlow, after losing Oliver went to the West Indies. Mr. Brownlow threatened Monks and told him he would be released with no penalties from the murder of Nancy, which he knew of, if he gave Oliver the portion of the inheritance that he deserved. Monks agrees, and waits while Mr. Brownlow goes to investigate the spotting of Sikes dog", "analysis": ""}
