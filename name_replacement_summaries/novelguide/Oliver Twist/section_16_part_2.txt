The police had taken Fagin, and the thieves had narrowly escaped. Much to their surprise, Sikes white dog came to the hideout. They wondered where Sikes was but did not want to see him because of the murder. Three hours after the dog showed up, the ghostly looking murderer himself found his way there. Soon after him, Charley Bates showed up but became very upset when he realized that Sikes was there. He started to scream, and got in a fight with the man who was much bigger than he was. As they were fighting, they realized that a mob was outside with police. They panicked and Charley began screaming that Sikes was there. As the people below tried to break into the building, Sikes decided to clime on the roof and try to lower himself with a rope to the ditch behind because the tide was out. The mob realized what he was doing, and as he was preparing himself, he slipped off the shingles of the roof. As he was falling the loop he made in the rope wrapped around his neck like a noose and hung him. The dog, on the roof also, seeing his owner fall and hang, jumped for the body but missed and cracked his head on the rocks below", "analysis": ""}
