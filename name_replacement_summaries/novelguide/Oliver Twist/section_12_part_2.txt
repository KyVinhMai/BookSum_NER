They were in a bad part of town in a worn down building next to the river. Mrs. Bumble negotiated with Monks and got him to give her twenty-five pounds for the information she was about to tell him. When he agreed to the sum, Mrs. Bumble told him the story of the night Sally died. In Sally's hand when she died was a pawnbroker's slip of an item she had pawned soon after she had taken it off Oliver Twist's mother's body. Mrs. Bumble had redeemed the pawned item and gave it to Monks. It was a gold locket, engraved with the name Agnes and contained a small gold band. Monks was pleased and beckoned his visitors to stand away from the table. He moved it to reveal a trap door in the floor that showed rushing water below. To the evidence Mrs. Bumble had given him, he tied a weight, and explained that once thrown into the current, it could never again be used against him. The Bumbles agreed to keep quiet with the matter and left the Monks establishment", "analysis": ""}
