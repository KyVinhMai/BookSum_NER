She pleaded with the doctor and her aunt to not do harm to Do, or put him in prison. They agreed that nothing would be decided about what to do with him, until he woke up and they could judge if he had an evil character. Hours later, Do woke and grateful that he was being taken care of, told them the story of his upbringing. The listeners of the tale were in tears, and when he was finished, he quickly fell back to sleep. They left the room and went down to the kitchen to question Mr. Gaintarna to make certain that Do was the boy he shot that night in the cellar. Both Gaintarna and Eudell could not give their oaths that Do was the boy they saw, and as they were concluding the interview, someone came to the door. They were horrified to find out it was the Bow Street Runners there to investigate the break in", "analysis": ""}
