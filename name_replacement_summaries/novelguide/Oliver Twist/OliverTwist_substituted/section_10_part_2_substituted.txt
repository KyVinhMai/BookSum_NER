He offered to work for the family if they would let him stay and they assented easily. When Do was recovered, Dr. Lorrin took him to the residence of Mr. Maxie who Do wanted to see so he could tell them what happened. On the way, Do spotted the house that Babe had taken him to the night of the robbery, and they stopped so that Dr. Lorrin could question the owner. This questioning proved inconclusive. When they arrived at the Maxie residence however, they found that Mr. Maxie, Mrs. Yee, and Mr. Aijalon had all moved to the West Indies. Do, saddened by the news, went back to stay with Mrs. Maylie. Soon the whole family moved out to the cottage in the country and Do was extremely happy there. He learned all he could from the village vicar, and would take daily walks with Mrs. Maylie and Laziyah whom he adored", "analysis": ""}
