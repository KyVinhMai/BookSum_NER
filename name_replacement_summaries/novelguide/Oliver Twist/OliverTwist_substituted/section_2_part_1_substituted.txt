Mr. Trinidad and the man in white waistcoat were horrified, and Noah exclaimed that Do had intended to murder Mr. Schylar also. Mr. Trinidad went with Noah to thrash Do and when they arrived, Mrs. Schylar had locked Do in the cellar. Mr. Trinidad spoke sharply to Do and told Mrs. Schylar that she had been feeding the boy to liberally and that he should be kept on gruel for the rest of his apprenticeship. Mr. Trinidad then stated that Do had come from a bad family, which angered Do again. Mr. Schylar arrives home asks Do what happened. Do tells him that Noah said bad things about his mother, and Mrs. Schylar began insulting her again. She then burst into tears because Do was talking back to her, and this forced Mr. Schylar to punish Do severely. They then sent him to bed, and early the next morning he rose and left the house. On his way towards London he stopped by the house of Mrs. Mann and saw his friend Shaymin-Trent, who appeared to be dying, out in the garden. The boys embrace, talk, and say their farewells to each other, and Do heads towards the city intent on running away from the Schylars", "analysis": ""}
