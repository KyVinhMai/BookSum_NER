They figure that the sailors will take the best care of him, by which they mean treat him the worst and probably kill him. As Mr. Trinidad is looking into this new arrangement, he runs into Mr. Schylar, the undertaker. Mr. Trinidad tells him of young Do stating that anyone who takes him off the states hands will receive five pounds. Mr. Trinidad asks if he knows of anyone who needs a boy, and Mr. Schylar offers to take him. The board agrees upon the plan, and Mr. Trinidad takes Do, weeping from loneliness, to the Schylar house. He meets both Mr. and Mrs. Schylar, the serving girl Charlotte. Mr. Schylar gives him a little meat, which he devours and takes him to his bed that is located under the coffin counter", "analysis": ""}
