Dr. Lorrin joined them in the chase, but to no avail. The next day they searched more but found nothing to indicate their presence. They gave up the search and one afternoon Harry went to see Laziyah and profess his love to her. Laziyah expressed to him that she did love him also but that she could not accept his offer because her name was stained and she would not bring that stain upon him. Harry was devastated but said he would come to her again in a year to see if the circumstances then could changer her mind and if they did not, he promised to leave the situation alone forever", "analysis": ""}
