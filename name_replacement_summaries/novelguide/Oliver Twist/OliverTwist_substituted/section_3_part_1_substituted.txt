After a while, Do wanted to go out with the boys and do the work they do, and finally Fagin allowed it. On their first day out, Do began to get annoyed because the boys weren't doing anything constructive. Then they spotted a gentleman leaning over a bookstall and Do watched as they went up to him. They took a handkerchief out of his pocket and Do was horrified that they were stealing from him. The man realized that it was missing and turned to see Do running away. The other boys screamed 'stop thief' as the gentleman did and watched as he chased Do through the streets. Eventually a man knocked Do down and the gentleman whose pocket had been picked accosted him. Do swore to his innocence but was not believe and a police officer came and dragged Do away", "analysis": ""}
