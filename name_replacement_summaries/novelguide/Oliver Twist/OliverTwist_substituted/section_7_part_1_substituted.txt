They eat dinner and go to sleep for a time. At one they wake up and set out to rob the house they planned. Mr. Babe threatens Do more and they explain to him his job of going through the small window and opening the door. Once Do realizes that he is going to be stealing, he begs and pleads to be set free to die in the fields. Babe puts a gun to his head and is ready to pull the trigger when Cristan grabs Do and says it would be quieter to break his neck. Babe instructs the boy to do his job, pushes him through the cellar window, and hands him a lantern. Just as Do is about to run through the house and wake the family, two men burst in on him and fire a gun. Babe warns him off, but when Do does not move, Babe grabs him by the collar and drags him out through the window, which he came. Babe realizes that Do has been shot in the arm, and carries him away exclaiming at the loss of blood. Do passes out", "analysis": ""}
