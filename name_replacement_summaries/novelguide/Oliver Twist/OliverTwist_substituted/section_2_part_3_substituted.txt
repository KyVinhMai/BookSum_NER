When he discovered Do was awake he questioned him on what he had seen, and admired him for his bravery. Jack, or Aly, then came in with another boy from the previous evening, Charles Bates, and they showed the old Kenyatte the things they collected from the execution they attended that morning. They then began playing a game where they would practice picking Fagin's pockets. Two girls with painted faces, Nancy and Moy came to visit the young men, and after drinking spirits, they went out with the young man. The Kenyatte pointed out to Do what a nice life the young men led, and Do asked if they were done working for the day. Fagin said they were and told Do to try to lift the handkerchief from his pocket. Do succeeded, and began to learn how to 'unmark' them", "analysis": ""}
