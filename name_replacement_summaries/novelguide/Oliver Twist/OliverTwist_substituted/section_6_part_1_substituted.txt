Upon arrival, he found Nancy along with the other thief. He was not happy she was there just because he was afraid she would go nuts on him again. Babe and he discussed a job they had been planning, and Babe said it was doomed to fail because their \"flash\" man, Cristan Crackit, could get no one to open the door for them. They then decided that they would use a small boy to enter the house and open the door for them. Nancy guesses that Fagin means to use Do for the job. Fagin tells her she's correct, and says Do will eventually make them a fortune because of his innocent looking face. They decide to do the job the night after the next day, and Fagin agrees that Do will be ready to deDorsie. The Kenyatte returns home to prepare Do for the task, but instead of waking him, he lets him sleep", "analysis": ""}
