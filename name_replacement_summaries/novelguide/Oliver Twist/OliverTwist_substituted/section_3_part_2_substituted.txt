The gentlemen, Mr. Maxie, began an argument with the magistrate and tried to explain that he was not sure if Do committed the crime. He also thought that Do's face looked familiar to him but he couldn't place it. The magistrate tried to question Do but he couldn't speak, and finally fainted. The magistrate began to sentence him to three months of heavy labor, when a winded man ran into the office and demanded to speak. He was the bookseller that Mr. Maxie had been shopping with when the robbery had occurred. The bookseller had seen the whole robbery and testified that Do had not committed the crime. The magistrate releases Do and Mr. Maxie takes him, unconscious, with him in his coach along with the savior bookseller", "analysis": ""}
