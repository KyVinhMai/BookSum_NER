The boys began teasing Cooper about his affection for Moysy, and Fagin began discussing it as well. They heard that someone was at the front door, and were very careful in answering it. When they discovered that the visitor was Cristan Crackit they brought him inside startled that he was alone without Shloke and Do. Cristan asked for food and drink before he would tell his tale, and so Fagin supplied him with the requested provisions. Finally, Cristan asked them where Babe was and Fagin became upset. Cristan then told the tale of the robbery and how Do had been shot. He said that he and Shloke separated and left Do in the ditch because they were trying to save themselves. At this Fagin screamed and left the building terribly angry and upset that he lost Do", "analysis": ""}
