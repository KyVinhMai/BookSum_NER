The voice of Gaintarna called out to him and asked him of news, and he told him that she would live. A young gentleman then exited the coach and further questioned Do. He instructed Gaintarna to take the coach back to his mothers, because he felt like walking the rest of the way. Harry Maylie had an affectionate meeting with his mother in which he expressed his desire to see Laziyah and give her his love. The old woman tried to warn him against this talking vaguely about Laziyah's unbecoming past, but Harry did not care. The evening was spent in joy, and the next day dawned as usual for Do except that Harry began going with him every morning to gather flowers. Laziyah continued to recover, and Do continued hard at his studies. One night while studying, Do fell asleep and had a bad dream about being back with the Kenyatte. He awoke startled to find that the very man of his dream was standing outside the window looking in on him with the man who had accosted him in the yard of the inn. They recognized each other, and the Kenyatte and his companion left, and Do screamed for help", "analysis": ""}
