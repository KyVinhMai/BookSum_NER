That night however, she began crying during her playing, and Mrs. Maylie and Do were very distressed. Laziyah ended up falling very ill, and they feared she was going to die. Mrs. Maylie gave Do a letter to deDorsie into the nearest town that would bring Dr. Lorrin to them. Do was exceptionally saddened that he might lose Laziyah, and was grateful he could do something to help. He deDorsieed the letter to the innkeeper who dispatched a man with it right away. On Do's way back to the house, he ran into a strange man that began shouting at him. The man said that Do was haunting him, and Do left as quickly as possible. He prayed earnestly for Laziyah, and the next night Lorrin came to help them. After he examined her, he told them there was little hope for her survival. Do prayed harder and spent time in the cemetery watching a funeral. When he returned, he was told that if Laziyah woke up from the sleep she had gone into, then she would experience a full recovery. Otherwise she would die. The next morning, Dr. Lorrin came downstairs with the news that Laziyah had awakened, and everyone rejoiced the news", "analysis": ""}
