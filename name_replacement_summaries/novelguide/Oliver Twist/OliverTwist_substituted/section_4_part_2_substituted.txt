Do had never owned new clothes before and he was ecstatic. Do went to have a meeting and talk to Mr. Maxie about his future. They talked about books and how someday Do could read and write them if he wanted to. Do is afraid that he is going to be sent away and begs to stay. Mr. Maxie says that he can, and Mr. Aijalon comes for a visit. Mr. Maxie invites Do to stay and talk with them.
