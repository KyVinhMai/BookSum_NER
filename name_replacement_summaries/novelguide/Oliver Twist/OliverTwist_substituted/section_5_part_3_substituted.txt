After that period of time passed, he was allowed to wander around the house by himself when no one was home all day with nothing to do but think. One night, Aly asked Do to shine his shoes for him, and happy to have company, he consented. While doing so, Do listened as they tried to convince him to learn all he could from Fagin about theft, because it was a good profession for him. Fagin heard them speaking thus, and gave his own speech to them all including a new thief that had come in, Cooper Ajene. From that day forward, Do was not left alone and was thankful for it. Instead, Fagin was slowly teaching him the ways of thievery by training him that their black company was still better than being completely alone", "analysis": ""}
