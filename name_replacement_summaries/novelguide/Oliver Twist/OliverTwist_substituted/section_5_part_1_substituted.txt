When they entered, Fagin, Aly, and Charlie Bates were there. They were happy to see Do and astonished at his clothing. Once they figured out he had five pounds on him and valuable books under his arms, Fagin and Mr. Babe began fighting over who got to keep the books and the money. Do begins to protest, saying that they should return the books to Mr. Maxie because he does not want him to think that he stole them. Then he calls for the police, and Fagin begins to beat him. Nancy then jumps into the way and threatens Fagin. She throws so much of a fit that she passes out. They took Do's clothes, locking him in a little room, and because of his illness and the day's adventures, he went straight to sleep", "analysis": ""}
