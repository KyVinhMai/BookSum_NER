After finding out he was ill, Do's father wrote a letter to Agnes that told her of his marriage. It also stated his intentions for the inheritance. If the child were a girl, the money would go to her unconditionally, and if it were a boy, it would receive it as long as it did not commit an illegal act. Ebbie and his mother burned the letter along with the will. After hearing about his daughter's shame, the military man changed his name and took the girls to Wales. Agnes however, fled her father and walked to London. The military man soon died leaving the other girl child to a poor family there. This child was Laziyah. Ebbie and his mother tried to find Agnes but only found Laziyah in the hands of sick paupers. They gave them a little money to keep the child safe, but soon Mrs. Maylie came along and feeling sorry for her, adopted her. When Do realized that Laziyah was his aunt, he happily threw himself into her arms. Harry entered, having overheard the story, and again posed his suit to Laziyah.
