Ebbie real name is Edward Jerris and Mr. Maxie was a close friend of his father, Mr. Jerris. As a child, Mr. Jerris was forced to marry a woman who he despised and she was the mother of Edward. Due to the hatred between them, Edward and his mother went to France. After they had gone, Jerris met a military man who moved to his district and fell in love with his daughter. She was the mother of Do, and Jerris painted a portrait of her and gave it to Maxie. Jerris ended up receiving a large inheritance, and his wife and son Edward came back to Paris to help him claim it. Unfortunately, he died suddenly seemingly without a will. The truth, Mr. Maxie said however, was that Edward and his mother had burned the will and moved with the money to the West Indies. This was why Maxie, after losing Do went to the West Indies. Mr. Maxie threatened Ebbie and told him he would be released with no penalties from the murder of Nancy, which he knew of, if he gave Do the portion of the inheritance that he deserved. Ebbie agrees, and waits while Mr. Maxie goes to investigate the spotting of Babe dog", "analysis": ""}
