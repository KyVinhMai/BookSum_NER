Lorrin recounts the circumstances to them, and they ask about the injured boy they heard the servants speaking of. Lorrin tells them that Do had nothing to do with the crime and that in all the excitement someone mistaken him for one of the thieves. Blathers and Feliz inspect the premises and demise that the robbers were professionals, probably from London. Dr. Lorrin, Mrs. Maylie, and Laziyah debate on whether or not Do should tell his story to the men, and they decide that though they believed him, it was rather farfetched. In Do's interest, they decided to make up a fake one for the boy so they could keep him safe. Stalling the officers, they took them down to the kitchen, gave them food, drink, and listened to their tale of another robbery. Finally, they want to go see Do. When they get to his room, he looks even worse and they question Mr. Gaintarna on why he assaulted the boy when he came in the house. Gaintarna swore that he made a mistake and that Do was not the boy he shot the night before. Blathers and Feliz then heard a rumor about two men and a boy in another town that had been found, and they went off to inspect to see if they had committed the crime. When their findings came up negative, Mrs. Maylie thanked them and sent them away. Do continued to thrive under their care", "analysis": ""}
