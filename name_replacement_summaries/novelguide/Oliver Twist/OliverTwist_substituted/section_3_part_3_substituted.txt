Do begins to get his strength back and is very grateful to both Maxie and Yee for taking care of him. Once he is healthy enough to sit in a chair, he sees a portrait of a woman. The picture fascinates him, and Mrs. Yee believes that he is upset by it and tries to take it away. Mr. Maxie comes to see him and notices that the woman in the picture looks exactly like him. He points this out to Mrs. Yee, but decides not to tell Do of it yet. Do, at their looks of exclamation, faints again.
