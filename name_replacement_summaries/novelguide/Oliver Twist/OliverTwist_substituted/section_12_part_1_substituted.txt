Two months had gone by and Mr. Trinidad already did not like his newly acquired matrimonial state. He and Mrs. Trinidad argued and she bested him, forcing him to wander the streets for a time. Deciding he was thirsty, he stopped into an almost empty tavern and kept looking curiously at the man who sat in their also. Finally they began talking and the man told Mr. Trinidad that he had been searching him out. He asked Mr. Trinidad questions about the night Do Kaegan was born, and Trinidad answered him as best as he could. The strange man wanted to find the nurse that deDorsieed Do, and Trinidad told him that she had died the previous winter.

They exchanged the address, and Mr. Trinidad found out the man's name was Ebbie", "analysis": ""}
