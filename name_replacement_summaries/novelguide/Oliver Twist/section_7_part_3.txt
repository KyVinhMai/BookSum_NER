The apocrathy's apprentice was there but there was nothing he could do for the old woman and soon left. The two crones who were the woman's best friends hovered around her, and the matron decided that she would leave before the woman awoke again. As Mrs. Corney was leaving, the dying woman sat up in bed and called to her. Mrs. Corney went to her and the woman began telling her the tale of a young woman she nursed a long time ago. The woman was Oliver's mother, and the old nurse kept saying that she stole the gold from the young woman soon after she died. Before she could reveal the identity of the dead young mother, or the secrets that only the nurse knew, she herself died. Mrs. Corney was disappointed she did not find out more information and left the room", "analysis": ""}
