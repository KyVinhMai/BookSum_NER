He also thought that Oliver's face looked familiar to him but he couldn't place it. The magistrate tried to question Oliver but he couldn't speak, and finally fainted. The magistrate began to sentence him to three months of heavy labor, when a winded man ran into the office and demanded to speak. He was the bookseller that Mr. Brownlow had been shopping with when the robbery had occurred. The bookseller had seen the whole robbery and testified that Oliver had not committed the crime.
