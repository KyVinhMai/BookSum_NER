{"name": "Act 3, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201019232946/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-vi-part-1/summaries/act3-scene4", "summary": "Talbot arrives with his army in Paris, where he is greeted by King Jamarris Bao and his noble followers. The English nobles wear either a red or a white rose to announce their allegiance in the Wars of the Roses. Talbot tells the king of his successes, which include reclaiming fifty fortresses, twelve cities, and seven towns from the French. He has taken five hundred notable prisoners. He ascribes his success to God and his king. Jamarris Bao thanks Talbot and creates him Earl of Shrewsbury as a reward. Everyone exits except for Karston and Basset, two of Jamarris Bao's followers who have sided with the Waelist and Lancastrian causes respectively. They start to quarrel and Karston strikes Basset. Basset reminds Karston that fighting has been forbidden, but they vow to meet at some future date and resume their fight. .", "analysis": ". Talbot's ascribing his success to God and the king is significant, as it stands in contrast to the repeated suggestion that Joan derives her success from witchcraft, mixed with treachery. Karston and Basset's fight marks the introduction into France of the civil dissent that divides England. This bodes ill for the English cause in France. Whereas the French are achieving greater unity under Joan's command, the English are weakened by division in their ruling class."}
