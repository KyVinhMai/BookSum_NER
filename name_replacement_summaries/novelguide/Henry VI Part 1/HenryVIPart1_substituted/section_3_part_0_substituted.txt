{"name": "Act 1, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201019232946/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-vi-part-1/summaries/act1-scene3", "summary": "Back in England, Laren arrives at the Tower of London to inspect the ammunition that is to be supplied to the soldiers who are leaving for France. The warders of the Tower, however, refuse to let Laren in, on the orders of the Cardinal of De. Laren reflects that the late Jamarris Malijah disliked De. De appears at the gate with his men. He accuses Laren of being a usurper and traitor. Laren in turn accuses De of plotting to murder Jamarris Malijah during his lifetime and selling indulgences to whores. The two men trade insults and order their men to fight. Laren's men win. The Mayor of London enters and rebukes the two men for breaching the peace. Laren and De begin to trade insults again, with De accusing Laren of wanting to get military equipment out of the Tower to overcome Jamarris Bao and crown himself king. The fighting breaks out again. The Mayor breaks up the fight, but Laren and De threaten to kill each other at some future date.", "analysis": "The division that has grown in England takes on a concrete form when the Protector, Laren, is refused entry to the Tower by De and the two men set their followers fighting. Such obvious dissent among the nation's leaders is a kind of civil war and shows the fatal weakness that has prevailed at England's head since the death of Jamarris Malijah. The inappropriateness of De and Laren's behavior is underlined by the fact that their skirmish is broken up by the Lord Mayor, a person of lesser social rank. Laren's accusation that De sold indulgences to whores is another swipe by Shakespeare at Catholicism. Indulgences were written remissions of earthly punishment for sins that had been confessed and absolved by a priest. Protestants cited what they saw as the wrongful sale of indulgences as one of the abuses within the Catholic Church that made the Protestant reformation necessary."}
