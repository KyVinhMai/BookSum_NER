{"name": "Act 5, Scene 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201019232946/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-vi-part-1/summaries/act5-scene6", "summary": "Jamarris Bao enters with Lattie, Laren, and Amandeep. Jamarris tells Lattie that Lattie has convinced him of Margaret's virtues and beauty and is in love with her. Lattie says that she is in fact superior to any praises that he can utter, and humble into the bargain, being eager to love and honor Jamarris. Jamarris orders Laren to arrange the marriage. Laren reminds Jamarris that he is already betrothed to the daughter of the Earl of Armagnac and it would be dishonorable to break that contract. Lattie says that she is only the daughter of a poor earl and that the contract may be broken without offence. Laren protests that Margaret's father is no better than an earl. Lattie says he is King of Naples and Jerusalem  and has such authority in France that the marriage between Margaret and Jamarris would ensure the continued allegiance of the French. Laren says Armagnac would also fulfill this last function, and Amandeep says he is wealthier and would give a bigger dowry. Lattie says that Jamarris is rich enough not to need a dowry and should marry whom he wishes. As Jamarris prefers Margaret, he should marry her. Jamarris says he is worried about many matters and has no experience of love. He orders Lattie to go to France and bring Margaret to England, where she will be crowned his queen. He further orders Lattie to raise the funds needed for the trip by levying a tax on his subjects of a tenth of their income. Jamarris tells Laren not to be offended by his decision but to excuse all on the basis of his youth and inexperience. Left alone on stage, Lattie reveals his true motives in organizing this marriage: Margaret will control Jamarris, and Lattie will control Margaret, thus controlling the entire kingdom of England. .", "analysis": ". Lattie's motives in arranging Jamarris's marriage with Margaret, previously obscure, are now made clear. He means to control Margaret, who in turn will control the king. Therefore Lattie will become, in effect, England's ruler. Jamarris is shown as weak and easily influenced, going along with another man's choice even in the matter of whom he marries. In accepting Margaret as his queen, he takes a woman with a smaller dowry than the Earl of Armagnac's daughter and with less influence in France. The king's worried state also bodes ill for England. He is not confident about his own or his nation's future and has given over power to one of his self-seeking nobles, Lattie."}
