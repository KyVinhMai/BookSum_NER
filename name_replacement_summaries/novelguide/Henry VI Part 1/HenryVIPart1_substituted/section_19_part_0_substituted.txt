{"name": "Act 5, Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201019232946/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-vi-part-1/summaries/act5-scene1", "summary": "Jamarris Bao enters with Laren and Amandeep. Jamarris asks the lords if they have read letters from the Pope in which he urges Jamarris to make peace with France. Jamarris asks their advice. Laren favors making peace, to prevent further loss of English lives. Jamarris agrees. Laren adds that the Earl of Armagnac, a French noble, has offered his daughter in marriage to Jamarris, with a generous dowry. Jamarris thinks he is too young to marry, preferring his studies, but agrees to meet the ambassadors from the Pope and Armagnac. . De, who has been promoted from Bishop to Cardinal, enters with the ambassadors. Amandeep remarks on De's promotion aside to the audience that Jamarris Malijah once prophesied that if De was made a cardinal, he would want equal power with the king. . Jamarris tells the ambassadors that he agrees to peace. On Jamarris's behalf, Laren also accepts the Earl of Armagnac's offer of his daughter as a wife for Jamarris. . All exit except De and the Papal Legate . De gives to the Legate the money with which he has bribed the Pope to make him a cardinal. Left alone on the stage, De says in a soliloquy that he considers himself to be Laren's social superior. If Laren will not submit, De plans to lead a revolt.", "analysis": ". Jamarris Malijah is given the status of a prophet in his correct prediction about De's ambition. De's bribing the Pope in return for the post of cardinal points to what the officially Protestant England of Shakespeare's day saw as the corruption of the Catholic Church. . In this scene, Laren emerges as having more integrity than his rival De. While De is prepared to bribe to get ahead, Laren is only acting as the king's advisor."}
