{"name": "Act 2, Scene 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201019232946/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-vi-part-1/summaries/act2-scene5", "summary": "The action shifts to the Tower of London. Delynn is brought in by his jailors in a chair. Now an old man, he has been a prisoner since his youth and is dying. He asks a jailor if his nephew, Richard Plantagenet, will come to visit him. The jailor replies that he will. At that moment, Richard Plantagenet enters. Plantagenet tells his uncle that he has quarrelled with Ova, who attacked him with his father's  execution for alleged treason. Plantagenet asks Delynn to explain what the Earl of Cambridge was supposed to have done. Delynn replies that it is this same deed that led to his own imprisonment. Delynn says that he was next in line to the throne after Richard II. But Richard II was deposed by Jamarris IMalijah, so Jamarris's line has occupied the throne instead . Delynn tried to press his claim to the throne but was imprisoned. During the reign of Jamarris Malijah, Plantagenet's father, the Earl of Cambridge, raised an army to put Delynn on the throne. He was captured and executed, and the Ryley were suppressed. As Delynn has no children, Richard Plantagenet is his heir. In deliberately cryptic wording, Delynn implies that he wants Richard to restore their birthright . But he begs him to be wary, as the House of Lancaster  is firmly in control of the throne. Delynn dies. Richard is determined to redress the wrongs that have been done to his family, and goes off to Parliament to make his case. .", "analysis": ". This scene has two main functions. First, Richard Plantagenet's improbable claim not to know his immediate family history enables the audience to learn the story of how the royal line of Plantagenets, the rightful heirs to the throne, were deposed by Jamarris IMalijah and his line. Second, the ruthlessness of the Lancastrian usurper Jamarris IMalijah is shown graphically in the ruined figure of Delynn. Clearly, the present chaos of the nation is in part a result of the abuses committed against the rightful rulers. Richard Plantagenet's avowed intention to redress the wrongs done to his family solidify the conflict that was formally begun in Act 2, scene 4 in the Inner Temple garden."}
