This is the idea of the body politic, an ancient metaphor of classical origin in which the head of state or king is portrayed as the head of the body politic and his subjects are seen as the body and limbs. The military hero Talbot and his army are an example of the perfect operation of such a metaphorical body, with Talbot as the head and his loyal men as the body . Thus Talbot, who has a strong link to the glorious reign of Henry V, embodies the head of the successful and unified body politic. Henry VI, in contrast, embodies the weak head of a decayed body politic. Henry is aware that the cause of the sickness of the body politic is civil dissent. He says, \"Civil dissention is a viperous worm / That gnaws at the bowels of the commonwealth\" . However, he is too weak and too young to put an end to this dissent. Heroic imagery In contrast with the weak king Henry VI, his father, Henry V, is portrayed as a hero of legendary, almost supernatural, power. In Act 1, scene 1, Gloucester says of Henry V, \"His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings\" , invoking his chivalric emblem of a dragon. Gloucester adds, \"He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered\" , suggesting that Henry was so great that his victories required little or no effort. Similar heroic imagery is used to describe Talbot - sometimes voiced by the man himself. Talbot describes his fearsome reputation among the French by describing the superhuman feats with which he is credited: \"So great fear of my name 'mongst them were spread That they supposed I could rend bars of steel And spurn in pieces posts of adamant.\" Act 1, scene 5, lines 28-30 Steel and adamant are famously hard and strong substances, so the suggestion that Talbot is capable of bending and breaking them emphasises his great strength. Such exaggeration in literature is called hyperbole. It is commonly used in descriptions of legendary heroes in epic literature. Religious, animal, and sexual imagery Shakespeare's assassination of Joan's character is achieved through the use of imagery. At the play's beginning, Joan speaks of herself in terms of sacred and religious imagery, invoking the Virgin Mary. After her first entrance, she tells Charles: \"Heaven and Our Lady gracious hath it pleased / To shine on my contemptible estate\" and \"God's mother deigned to appear to me\" . However, Shakespeare undermines any temptation for the audience to accept Joan's claims of a God-given mission by surrounding her with suggestive sexual imagery, having Alencon comment about Charles' long and intimate conversation with Joan: \"Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock, / Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.\" . By Act 3, scene 3, Shakespeare is suggesting that Joan is a witch whose persuasive power derives not from God but from the devil. When she persuades Burgundy to turn traitor to England, he says of her, \"Either she hath bewitched me with her words, / Or nature makes me suddenly relent\" . By Act 5, scene 3, the evil spirits that, it has been suggested, assist Joan actually enter in person and refuse to help her. Here, Joan talks of the \"blood-sacrifice\" she has made to them in return for their support. In Act 5, scene 5, Joan repudiates her father, who addresses her in imagery that strips her of any spiritual identity. The Shepherd curses his daughter as a whore, a \"drab\" , an idea reprised by Richard, Duke of York in the same scene when he calls her a \"Strumpet\" . Joan herself confirms this interpretation of her character when she repeatedly changes her story about the identity of her supposed baby. The Shepherd also uses animal imagery to address Joan, wishing in line 29 that her mother's milk were \"ratsbane\" rat poison or that \"some ravenous wolf had eaten thee\" . In contrast with Jesus Christ, whose nativity is seen by Christians as a holy event, the Shepherd curses \"the time / Of thy nativity\" .", "analysis": ""}
