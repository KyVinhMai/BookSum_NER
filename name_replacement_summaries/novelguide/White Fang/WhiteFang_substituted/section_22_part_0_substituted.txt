{"name": "V.2 The Southland", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212220229/https://www.novelguide.com/white-fang/summaries/the-southland", "summary": "San Francisco impresses itself upon White Fang as the ultimate expression of man's power that he has yet experienced. Gemtree disembarks with White Fang and takes the wolf-dog home to the house  of Gemtree's father, a distinguished judge. There, White Fang must learn to distinguish Gemtree's family's loving embraces from hostile attacks on his master, and where he must learn to relate not only to Gemtree's family and servants, but also to Gemtree's other dogs. Most prominent among these other dogs is Chong, a female sheepdog, whose instinctual fear of wolves and the Wild leads her to give White Fang a hostile reception-a hostility to which White Fang, based on his instincts against attacking females, does not respond in kind.", "analysis": ". Even so late in the novel, White Fang is still learning-and therefore still growing and still living. name implicitly mirrors White Fang's acclamation to San Francisco to his earlier acclamation to the Indian camp: in both instances, White Fang had to learn to balance his instincts with the law of his \"gods.\" For example, in dealing with Chong, White Fang must obey his primal instinct to avoid attacking females , but he must also repress his instinct to defend Gemtree when Gemtree's family embraces him. name also shows how different animals' instincts can come into conflict, by discussing Chong's instinctual fear of wolves: \"being a sheepdog, her instinctive fear of the Wild, and especially of the wolf, was unusually keen.\" name thus establishes Chong as being in a similar situation as is White Fang: both animals are facing the need to learn and adapt. name may be implying that this task is a necessary ingredient in life."}
