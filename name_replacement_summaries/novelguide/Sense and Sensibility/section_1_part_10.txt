The two talk, and she is delighted to find that he shares her love of music and dancing, and her passion for certain authors. After he has left, Elinor expresses concern that Marianne has told Willoughby everything about herself and that there will be nothing left for future occasions. Marianne bridles at this, believing that Elinor is rebuking her for being too open. Marianne recovers. Willoughby continues to visit her every day, and they read, talk, and sing together. Marianne learns that he reads literature aloud with all the sensibility and passion that Edward sadly lacks. Elinor feels that he is too prone to speak his thoughts, without consideration of others or of the situation. Marianne feels that he is everything that she has always wished for in a man. Mrs. Dashwood now expects two marriages, between Marianne and Willoughby, and Elinor and Edward. Elinor notices that Colonel Brandon's spirits seem to be oppressed by past disappointments. Willoughby cruelly dismisses him as the kind of man \"whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to,\" and Marianne agrees. She thinks he lacks \"genius\" and \"spirit", "analysis": ""}
