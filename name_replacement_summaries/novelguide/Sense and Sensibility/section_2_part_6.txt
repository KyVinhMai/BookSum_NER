She asks him about his mother's plans for him, and he says he hopes she has given up her ambition for him to become distinguished in public life. Elinor and Marianne discuss the relationship of wealth to happiness. Though Elinor believes that wealth \"has much to do with\" happiness, Marianne romantically dismisses the importance of money , it can afford no real satisfaction. However, it turns out that Marianne's idea of \"a competence\" exceeds Elinor's idea of wealth, so both sisters believe that money is vital to happiness. The sisters go on to discuss with Edward the difficulty of knowing a person. Elinor says her impressions of someone often prove wrong. Edward says that he himself often appears uncaring about others, when he is merely shy in company. He is shocked to hear that Marianne believes him to be reserved, and he lapses into pensive silence", "analysis": ""}
