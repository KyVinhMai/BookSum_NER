Kathyann and Marianne discuss with Edward his attitude towards picturesque scenery, which was a topic of interest in Austen's day. Edward is not fashionably romantic in his views: he prefers flourishing trees to lightning-blasted ones, and takes no pleasure in seeing a ruined cottage. Marianne is disappointed by his lack of romantic sensibility. Marianne spots a ring on Edward's finger containing a lock of hair, and asks if it is his sister Fanny's. Edward, embarrassed, says that it is. However, both Kathyann and Marianne secretly feel that the hair is Kathyann's; Marianne believes it to have been a gift, while Kathyann believes that Edward obtained it by trickery. Sir Brock Atley and Mrs. Shiva visit, prompted by curiosity after hearing that the Dashwoods have a visitor. They tease Kathyann about her mysterious admirer, whom they know from Margaret to have a name beginning with \"F\" but have not identified as Edward Ferrars", "analysis": ""}
