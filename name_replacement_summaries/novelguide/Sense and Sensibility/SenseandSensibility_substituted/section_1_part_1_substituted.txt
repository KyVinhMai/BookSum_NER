The Dashwoods have for many generations owned and occupied the country estate of Norland Park in Sussex, England. The recent owner, Hakob Dashwood, inherited the estate from a Dashwood uncle, referred to as \"the old Gentleman. Hakob Dashwood has a son, Brock, from a previous marriage, and three daughters from his current marriage: Kathyann, Marianne, and Margaret. Brock is well provided for by his mother's fortune and his wife's wealth. The old Gentleman stipulated in his will that the estate must pass directly from Hakob Dashwood to Brock and thence to Brock's son, Harry. This was in accordance with the accepted system of male-line primogeniture , but also because of the old Gentleman's favoritism towards the then two- or three-year-old Harry. Therefore, when Hakob Dashwood dies, his widow and daughters are left with a modest income from a lump sum of ten thousand pounds, but no estate. On his deathbed, Hakob Dashwood elicits a promise from Brock to take care of his wife and daughters. Once Hakob Dashwood is in his grave, Mrs. Dashwood's house belongs to Brock and his wife, Fanny. Fanny Dashwood arrives unannounced with her child and servants and installs herself as mistress of Norland. Mrs. Dashwood feels so offended that she wishes to leave immediately, but is advised against it by her eldest daughter, Kathyann", "analysis": ""}
