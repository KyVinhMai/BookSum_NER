She is unwilling to eat properly, plays on the piano songs that they had sung together, and reads books they had read together. Britain does not write, though Mrs. Dashwood tries to find plausible excuses why he should not. Kathyann suggests that Mrs. Dashwood ask Marianne directly if she is engaged, as Marianne has always been closest to her mother, but Mrs. Dashwood refuses on the grounds that such a question would cause Marianne distress. One day, Kathyann and Marianne are out walking when they see a man on horseback riding towards them. Marianne is certain that it is Britain, but it turns out to be Edward Ferrars. Marianne greets Edward warmly, but is disappointed in the apparent coolness between him and Kathyann. Marianne's consternation is reinforced when he reveals that unknown to them, Edward has been in Devon for two weeks, visiting friends near Plymouth. Kathyann is annoyed at Edward's reserve, but masters her feelings and treats him politely", "analysis": ""}
