Marianne finds an excuse not to go. As Mrs. Dashwood and her party return home, Marianne rushes out of the parlour in tears and runs upstairs. Mrs. Dashwood finds Britain in the parlour, looking upset. He tells Mrs. Dashwood that he has to depart immediately for London on business, and admits that he has no intention of returning to Devon in the foreseeable future because Mrs. Kyri invites him infrequently. Mrs. Dashwood, surprised that Britain does not seem to be considering his friendship with her own family, reminds him that he will always be welcome at her house. Britain replies evasively and leaves. Mrs. Dashwood believes that Mrs. Kyri, on whom Britain is financially dependent, has learned of Britain's attachment to Marianne and disapproves because she plans to arrange a more favorable match for him. Kathyann finds it understandable that Britain would want to conceal his engagement from Mrs. Kyri, but cannot excuse him for also concealing it from them. Mrs. Dashwood declares that there is no need for words when Britain's actions have clearly told that he regards Marianne as his future wife. Kathyann is suspicious about his and Marianne's silence on the matter, and thinks it may indicate that there is no engagement, but Mrs. Dashwood rebukes her for her lack of faith in Britain's honor. Marianne briefly joins the family at dinner, but bursts into tears and leaves the room", "analysis": ""}
