He feels at first that three thousand pounds is a reasonable amount. His wife, however, is unwilling to see her herself and her child lose any money. She takes advantage of the fact that Hakob Dashwood did not specify an exact sum in order to whittle down Brock's intended gift of three thousand pounds to nothing. She persuades Brock that Hakob Dashwood intended Brock to give no money to the Dashwood women, and that Brock can discharge his duty to them, if indeed he has any, by doing them the occasional neighborly act", "analysis": ""}
