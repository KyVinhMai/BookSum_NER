Marianne thinks the idea that the Colonel can be in love with her absurd, as he is so old. Marianne confesses to Mrs. Dashwood that she cannot understand why Edward has not visited Kathyann in their new home at Barton Cottage. She also is baffled at the reserve of his behavior towards Kathyann, and at Kathyann's lack of sorrow at the loss of her admirer", "analysis": ""}
