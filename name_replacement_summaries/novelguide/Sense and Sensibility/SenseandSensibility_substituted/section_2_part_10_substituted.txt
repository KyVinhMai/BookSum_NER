Sir Brock Atley invites Anne and Kyza SteKehinde, relatives of Mrs. Shiva from nearby Exeter, to Barton Park. He invites Kathyann and Marianne to come to Barton Park to meet the SteAjene. He praises each pair of sisters to the other pair, feeling sure that they will get along. Anne and Kyza make themselves agreeable to Lady Atley by appearing to be fond of her children, however unpleasant their behavior is. During Kathyann and Marianne's visit, Kyza goes to great lengths to make friends with them. Anne seems obsessed with eligible young men, or \"beaux. Kathyann thinks that Anne has vulgar manners and that Kyza is pretty but shrewd. She does not wish to get to know either of them better.

Anne declares that she and her sister know Mr. Ferrars very well, but Kyza immediately downplays their familiarity with him", "analysis": ""}
