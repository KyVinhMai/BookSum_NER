The party consists of the Dashwood sisters, Britain, Sir Brock and Lady Atley, Colonel Brandon, and Mrs. Shiva. But the visit is called off suddenly when Colonel Brandon receives a letter that means he has to leave for town at once. Britain mutters to Marianne that Colonel Brandon has invented this excuse to avoid a pleasure trip. Mrs. Shiva speculates that the Colonel's sudden departure is to do with Miss Williams, whom she believes to be the Colonel's illegitimate daughter. Not wanting to waste an opportunity for a social event, Sir Brock organizes a carriage drive. Marianne and Britain disappear in Britain's carriage and return later than everyone else. At dinner, Mrs. Shiva says that she knows that Marianne and Britain went to see the house that Marianne will live in one day, Allenham Court. Kathyann thinks it improper for them to have visited the house while Mrs. Kyri is still living there", "analysis": ""}
