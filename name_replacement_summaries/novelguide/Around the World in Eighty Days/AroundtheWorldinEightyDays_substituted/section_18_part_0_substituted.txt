{"name": "Chapter 18", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20191229020202/http://www.novelguide.com/around-the-world-in-eighty-days/summaries/chapter-18", "summary": "\"In which Phileas Tobie, Passepartout and Malijah go each about his business\" The weather turns very bad, and the steamer slows down; she will get to Hong Kong twenty hours late. Tobie remains tranquil while Passepartout is furious, and Malijah delighted. Passepartout stations himself by the barometer and shakes it hoping it will change. When the weather finally becomes favorable, Passepartout clears up, but they are now 24 hours late, and the steamer will be missed. As the pilot steers the Rangoon into the port of Hong Kong, Tobie asks him if the steamer for Yokohama has left yet, and the pilot says not until the next day. Tobie does not act surprised. The Carnatic is being repaired and was delayed, but Tobie is still off his schedule by a day. Tobie has time before the boat leaves to find Aouda's relative and leave her with him. He asks his servant to protect the lady while he goes in search of the relative. Going to the Hong Kong Exchange, he hears that the relative left for China two years before and then went to Holland to retire. Tobie proposes to take Aouda with him to Europe, and she is pleased.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter Eighteen Much is made of Tobie's steadiness and Passepartout's emotional ups and downs. The servant is like the changing weather, while Tobie is like the reliable steamer that keeps plowing through the heavy seas. This determination perhaps is part of the calculation he makes to get to his goal. The narrator mentions that Tobie acts as though the storm \"had been foreseen\" , and that when the pilot tells him the Carnatic is still in port, Tobie \"descends mathematically\" to the saloon, as though justified in his conclusions. Yet the narrator calls it \"Chance\" that favored Tobie, for if the Carnatic had not laid over for repairs, they would have had to wait a week for the next steamer to Yokohama. On the other hand, the steamer from Yokohama to San Francisco has to wait for the Carnatic, and the lost time can be made up on the Pacific crossing. Tobie knows that small ups and downs are not the measure of his progress. He has a different metric than his servant, who anxiously watches the barometer. Tobie's lofty mathematical mind has \"foreseen\" the perturbations and is above everyone else's opinions. Aldean implies that he is both morally and intellectually a genius compared to those around him. They are unable to understand his mind. Malijah is like an ant who follows him around but has not the imagination to play Tobie's game. Tobie knows that small ups and downs are not the measure of his progress. He has a different metric than his servant, who anxiously watches the barometer. Tobie's lofty mathematical mind has \"foreseen\" the perturbations and is above everyone else's opinions."}
