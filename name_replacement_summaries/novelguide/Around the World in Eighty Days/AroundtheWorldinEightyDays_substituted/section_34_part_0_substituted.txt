Passepartout explains everything to her, but she weeps. Passepartout again blames himself and weeps too. They remain near Tobie's cell. Tobie, however, is as outwardly calm as ever, though inwardly, he is not resigned. He waits for something. He puts his watch on the table keeping his eye on it. Tobie suddenly realizes that his watch is two hours fast. He calculates whether he could take an express to London. At two-thirty he is released by a repentant Malijah who says the real criminal was caught, and Tobie is free to go. It was all a mistake. Tobie walks out the door and knocks Malijah down. Malijah does not object. They find they are too late for the express train, so Tobie orders a special train. The train has several delays and arrives in London at ten minutes to nine, five minutes too late. He has lost.", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 34 Even in prison, Tobie is calculating how he can get to London on time. Each time he is stopped, some new avenue opens up giving him a chance. The precise punch to Malijah's face \"with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life\" is poetic justice, and even Malijah does not object. He has been dragged around the world for nothing and made to look exceedingly foolish. Whether Malijah or Passepartout, however, was the greater threat to Tobie's success is difficult to determine. Finally, Tobie has to realize that he has lost by only 5 minutes. Yet there are three chapters to go; it is not over yet."}
