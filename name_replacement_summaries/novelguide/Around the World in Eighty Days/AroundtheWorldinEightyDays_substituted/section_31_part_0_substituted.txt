{"name": "Chapter 31", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20191229020202/http://www.novelguide.com/around-the-world-in-eighty-days/summaries/chapter-31", "summary": "\"In which Malijah the detective considerably furthers the interests of Phileas Tobie\" Tobie is twenty hours behind, and Passepartout is desolate for ruining his master. Malijah however, determines that Tobie is only 8 hours behind since he was counting the 11 hours they had to wait for the steamer. Malijah comes up with the idea of traveling on a sledge with sails over the prairie. This came from a man who had offered to take Malijah to Omaha on such a device. The man's name is Hien and he is at the station. The sledges are used to go from fort to fort in the winter. Hien says he can get Tobie to Omaha in a few hours. The whole company of Tobie, Aouda, Passepartout, Malijah, and Hien embark on the sledge, wrapped against the cold wind. The distance is 200 miles. The sledge goes 40 miles an hour over the flat and frozen prairie. The sledge can go more directly than the railroad. There is still a chance. Passepartout wants to shake Malijah's hand. There is danger, however, because of the wolves that follow them. They make Omaha in time to jump on a train heading east. On the 10th of December they arrive at Chicago, with still 900 miles to New York. They have no trouble getting trains the rest of the way, and get to New York on the 11th of December, alas, 45 minutes after the steamer leaves for Liverpool!", "analysis": "Commentary on Chapter 31 Malijah is now the one who comes up with the solution, but, of course, his motive is to get Tobie back to England since he has the arrest warrant in his pocket. Passepartout feels his bargain about keeping the detective's secret is justified. The journey happens primarily by train and steamer, but there are a collection of odd vehicles in this story that make it more interesting--the sledge with sails is one more of these. The journey to New York is like a chase scene with lots of suspense--the closer to the goal, the more delays. Yet Tobie, his friends, and Malijah are now one team working together."}
