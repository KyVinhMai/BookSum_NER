Why does God allow injustice in the world? Does chance rule the universe? Philosophy begins by explaining the difference between Providence, or the benign ordering of the universe, and Fate, which for the ancients was a sort of harsh necessity, not always seeming to be fair. Fate seemed capricious and cruel to humans. Philosophy denies this and tries to harmonize the idea of Fate and Providence. Fate is just the human looking up at the incomprehensible turns of Fortune's Wheel. Fate is how things fall due in time. If we could see from God's larger timeless view, we would understand how each stroke of Fate is actually part of a benign plan for each person. Perhaps a good person like Boethius, for instance, needed a hardship like this to test his faith in God. She says if you understood God's plan, you would know there is no evil anywhere. This idea that God is a benign unity working all apparent evil into a universal good, requires, she says, \"purity of mind\" . Again, she states that it is Love that maintains the unity and order in the world. Summary of Part VII Now Philosophy comes to a surprising conclusion based on the previous arguments: \"All fortune is certainly good\" . Boethius wonders how this could be. Fortune, she says, is used in the divine scheme to work out things for the good of all, so it is just to every person. If something is useful, it is good. A wise man knows that all fortune is a sort of opportunity, and it is a virtue to remain unmoved by whatever fortune befalls. It is in one's own hands to shape fortune for one's own good, whatever it may be. Commentary on Part VII       Philosophy ends Book IV with a poem to illustrate her point. She shows how the Greek heroes Agamemnon, Odysseus, and Hercules were given hard tasks in life, but they did not back down from taking fate into their own hands and shaping their lives. These great examples show us we should not hang back. Hercules even earned a place in heaven by taking on everything given to him to do, no matter how impossible.
