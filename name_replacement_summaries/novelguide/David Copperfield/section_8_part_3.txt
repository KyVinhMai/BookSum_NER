David accompanies Steerforth to Mrs. Steerforth's home. While Steerforth is occupied with his mother, Rosa Dartle asks David why he has been keeping Steerforth so engrossed that he has not been home. When David protests that he has not seen Steerforth until last night, Rosa is shocked. She questions David about what Steerforth is doing, but David can tell her nothing. She says that if Steerforth and his mother were ever to quarrel, they would be hard to reconcile, since they are both too proud to give in. Steerforth is charming to Rosa, and proposes that they will love each other very much in the future. Rosa, furious, strikes him and storms out of the room. That night, David says goodbye to Steerforth. Steerforth says that he wishes that David could call him by the nickname he gave David, Daisy. He asks that if anything should separate them, David should think of him at his best. David tells Steerforth that he will always love him", "analysis": ""}
