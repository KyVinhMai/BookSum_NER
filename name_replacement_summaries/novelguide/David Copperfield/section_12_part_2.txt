David and Dora begin their married life. Dora proves to be inept at housekeeping. Their servant, Mary Anne, is also incompetent. When David asks Dora to bring Mary Anne into line, Dora pouts and accuses David of blaming her for being a disagreeable wife. David asks Betsey to advise Dora on housekeeping, but Betsey refuses. She does not wish to meddle and create division, and she reminds him of the unhappiness that the Murdstones created from their desire to improve David's mother. Although she does not explicitly say so, Betsey seems to have doubts about the wisdom of David's choice of wife. Mary Anne steals David's cutlery and borrows money using his name, so David fires her. A succession of servants follows, all of whom cheat David and Dora. Dora suggests to David that when he feels angry or disappointed with her, he should merely think of her as his \"child-wife. Dora tries a little to improve her housekeeping. Sometimes she sits poring over a household accounts book, but she gets frustrated that she cannot make sense of it and gives up. Though David loves Dora, and she dotes on him, he has the sense that something is missing in his life, and wishes that he could talk to her as an equal. Instead, he finds that he must shoulder all their responsibilities alone. Wanting to be of some use to David, Dora asks him to let her sit by him while he is writing and hold his pens. David agrees. Betsey is kind to Dora, calling her \"Little Blossom", "analysis": ""}
