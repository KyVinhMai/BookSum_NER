David sets out on foot for Dover, selling some of his clothes to buy food. The shopkeepers who buy his clothes take advantage of him, giving him far less money than the clothes are worth. He sleeps in the open, not wanting to spend what money he has on a room for the night. He is abused, threatened and stoned by fellow travelers. After several days of walking, David arrives in Dover, hungry, penniless, dressed in ragged clothes and covered in dust. He asks local shopkeepers where his aunt Betsey lives, but his beggar-like appearance leads them to treat him with disrespect. Eventually, he is given accurate directions and reaches Betsey's cottage. He finds his aunt gardening. Not recognizing him, she tells him to go away. He tells her that he is her nephew, and collapses in tears. Betsey takes David into her parlor and asks Mr. Dick, a simple-minded and unworldly man who lives with her, for advice on what to do. Mr. Dick advises her to give David a bath, which she does. Betsey compares David to the sister he never had and reflects that she never would have acted so stupidly as he has. After dinner, Betsey reflects contemptuously on David's mother's decision to marry a man who treated her badly. She asks Mr. Dick once more what she should do with David, and he suggests putting him to bed. This she does. As David gratefully settles down into bed, he prays that he might never be homeless again, and that he never might forget the homeless", "analysis": ""}
