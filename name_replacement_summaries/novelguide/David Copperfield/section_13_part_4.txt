Mr. Peggotty tells David and Betsey Little Em'ly's story after she escaped from Littimer. Hysterical, she ran to a beach, believing that her home was there, and collapsed. She was rescued by a local woman, who looked after her until she recovered. Little Em'ly went to France and thence to England. She intended to go home, but her courage failed her, as she feared she might not be forgiven. She went to London, where she met a woman who promised to give her respectable work involving needlework, and who took her in. Martha discovered her, and rescued her. Mr. Peggotty says that he and Little Em'ly will emigrate to Australia, where she can make a fresh start. Peggotty intends to stay in England, and look after Ham. Mr. Peggotty means to provide a separate home for Mrs. Gummidge, whom he believes to be too difficult a character to impose upon Peggotty. David accompanies Mr. Peggotty to Yarmouth, where he will say goodbye to his household. David calls in on Mr. Omer, whose legs are failing. David tells him that with Martha's help, Little Em'ly has been restored to her uncle. Mr. Omer is happy at this news, and offers to help Martha financially. David proceeds to Ham's house, where Peggotty now lives. Peggotty tells David that she believes Ham to be broken-hearted, though he still works hard. Ham takes David aside and asks him to beg Little Em'ly to forgive him for imposing his love on her. If he had not done so, he believes that she might have confided in him as a friend, and he could have saved her. Ham also wants David to tell her that he will always love her. Mrs. Gummidge asks Mr. Peggotty if she can accompany him and Little Em'ly to Australia, and he agrees. Mr. Peggotty shuts up his house", "analysis": ""}
