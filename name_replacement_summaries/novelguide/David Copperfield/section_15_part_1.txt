On David's return to England, he goes to visit Traddles. He asks a waiter at an inn near Traddles's office whether he knows an up-and-coming lawyer of that name. The waiter does not, and loses interest when David says Traddles has only been practicing for three years. David reflects that England, with its rigid, pompous, and ancient traditions, is a hard place to rise in. He feels that here, Traddles has little hope of success. David finds Traddles's office. Traddles is overjoyed to see David, and tells him that he is married, and happily so. At that moment, Sophy comes out from behind a curtain, where she has been hiding. Traddles and Sophy are living in his office to save money, because he is still poor. Sophy's sisters are staying with them, as they wish to see London. At a coffee-house, David runs across Mr. Chillip, the doctor who delivered him as a baby. Mr. Chillip tells him that he lives near the Murdstones. They are cruel to Mr. Murdstone's latest wife, and have quite destroyed her spirit", "analysis": ""}
