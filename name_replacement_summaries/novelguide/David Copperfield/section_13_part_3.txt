Mr. Peggotty continues his search for Little Em'ly, never losing hope. Martha seeks out David and says that she has news for Mr. Peggotty; she has been to his house, but he is not at home, so she left a note for him to meet her. Martha takes David to the slum dwelling where she lives. Inside the house, they see a woman enter Martha's room. David sees that it is Rosa Dartle. Martha and David listen at the door, and overhear Rosa pouring contempt onto Little Em'ly and blaming her for laying waste to the Steerforth family. Little Em'ly points out that Steerforth deceived her, and that her mistake was to love and trust him. Rosa tells Little Em'ly to leave the house or Rosa will proclaim her story to the world. Mr. Peggotty arrives. Little Em'ly faints, and Mr. Peggotty takes her tenderly in his arms", "analysis": ""}
