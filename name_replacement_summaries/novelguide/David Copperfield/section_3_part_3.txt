During the next school term, David is summoned to Mr. Creakle's room, where Mrs. Creakle breaks the news to him that his mother has died and that the baby is likely to die too. He is sent home to attend her funeral and is collected by Mr. Omer, the funeral director. Mr. Omer takes David to his shop, where David meets Mr. Omer's daughter, Minnie, and her lover, Mr. Joram. Mr. Omer measures David for his mourning suit. Mr. Joram is making David's mother's coffin, and David sits listening to the nails being hammered in and wondering at the family's cheerfulness. Mr. Omer takes David home, where he finds Mr. Murdstone in silent grief and Miss Murdstone busy at her writing desk. Neither shows any concern for David. Only Peggotty, who watches over Clara's body much of the time, comes and sits with him before he goes to sleep. After the funeral, Peggotty tells David that Clara was unhappy and unwell for some time, and became frailer after having the baby. Clara died blessing David, and with her head on Peggotty's arm. The baby died a day later, and was buried in his mother's arms", "analysis": ""}
