The adult David reflects on his amazement that he, a sensitive child of considerable ability, was \"so easily thrown away at such an age\" by being sent out to work in a wine warehouse. David is employed in menial work handling wine bottles. His fellow employees are uneducated boys. He feels that all his hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man have been crushed. Mr. Quinion, the manager, summons David to his office and introduces him to Mr. Micawber, in whose house he will be lodging. Mr. Micawber is an amiable man who speaks in a high-flown fashion, never using a simple word where a long-winded phrase can be found instead. Mr. Micawber takes David to his house, where he meets Mrs. Micawber and their four children. Mrs. Micawber tells David that their financial difficulties are overwhelming, which is why they have to take him as a lodger. Creditors come to the house at all hours demanding payment. The Micawbers swing between grief at their plight and groundless optimism. David is paid so little in his job that he mainly lives off bread, cheese and milk. He becomes an object of wonder among the local innkeepers and storekeepers for leading an independent life at so young an age. He works hard at the warehouse and never complains, though he is very unhappy. One evening, Mrs. Micawber confides in David that the family is at crisis point regarding money. Mrs. Micawber asks him to take some of their belongings to the pawnbroker's, which he does regularly. But Mr. Micawber is arrested and thrown into the debtors' prison. He organizes a petition, signed by the prisoners, to Parliament for a change in the law regarding imprisonment for debt", "analysis": ""}
