David receives a mysterious letter from Mr. Micawber, in which he says that his former peace of mind and self-respect are shattered. He asks David to meet him in London, so that he can explain. At the same time, Traddles receives a similar letter from Mrs. Micawber, asking him to intercede between Mr. Micawber and his estranged family. David and Traddles meet Mr. Micawber, who seems unusually gloomy. They go to Betsey's house rather than David's, as Dora is ill. Mr. Micawber reveals that Uriah has been engaged in fraud and deception. He becomes so overwrought that he runs out of the house. Shortly afterwards, David receives a letter from him, written at a nearby inn, in which he invites David to meet him next week at an inn in Canterbury", "analysis": ""}
