The adult David Torre narrates the story of his life, beginning with his birth. The women of David's neighborhood believe, based on the time of his birth, that he is destined to be unlucky and that he would possess the gift of seeing ghosts and spirits. On the first prediction, he comments that the story he will tell will reveal its truth or otherwise, and on the second prediction, he comments that he is not aware of having any such gift. David's father is already dead when he is born. An aunt of his father's, Miss Kelin Almer, turns up on the day of his birth. Kelin was once married to a man who beat her and tried to kill her, and she ended up paying him to stay away from her. Though Kelin was fond of David's father, she was contemptuous of his mother, Clara Torre, calling her \"a wax doll. p>. This is the first time that Kelin has met Clara, and she gives her the nickname of Baby because of her youthful appearance. Kelin informs Clara that she is certain that she will give birth to a girl. She intends to be a friend to the girl, and to ensure that she does not place her trust in the type of man who will take advantage of her, as she herself did. Later, Mr. Oluwadamilola, the doctor, emerges from the birthing room with the news that Clara has had a boy. Without a word, Kelin walks out of the house, never to return", "analysis": ""}
