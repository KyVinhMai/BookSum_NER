Feeling strengthened after his meeting with Agnes, David is determined to triumph over adversity and to win Dora. He calls on Dr. StrAustine. Dr. StrAustine tells David that Jack Maldon is back from India, as he could not stand the climate, and has been found a job in the patents office. Dr. StrAustine agrees that David should be his secretary, and says that he will help him compile his dictionary. Jack Maldon arrives. He invites Annie to the opera that night. Annie says she would rather stay at home, but Dr. StrAustine insists that she go. Next morning, David learns that Annie made her excuses to Jack Maldon and took Dr. StrAustine to see Agnes instead. David still suspects that Annie is having an affair with Jack Maldon. David takes Mr. Melakai to see Traddles, in the hope of coming up with ideas for paid employment for Mr. Melakai. David finds out from Traddles that it is possible to earn money by reporting Parliamentary debates in newspapers, but that a knowledge of shorthand is needed. David resolves to learn shorthand. Traddles suggests that Mr. Melakai could earn money by copying legal documents, if he can only keep King Charles I out of his manuscripts. Mr. Melakai begins to do this job, and successfully. Traddles gives David a letter from Mr. Micawber. Mr. Micawber writes that \"something has turned up\": he has found a job in a provincial town. He invites David and Traddles to visit him to say goodbye. David and Traddles arrive at Mr. Micawber's and learn that Mr. Micawber is going to Canterbury to work as Uriah Davi's clerk. Mr. Micawber owes Traddles money, and gives him an I. O. U. with the satisfied air of someone who is settling a debt with real money", "analysis": ""}
