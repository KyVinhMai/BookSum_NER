David asks Kelin if she knows anything more about Agnes's mysterious sweetheart. Kelin says that she believes that Agnes is soon to be married. David cannot bear not to know whom Agnes loves, and asks her. She will not say, and bursts into tears. David guesses that he is the one she loves. He takes her in his arms and tells her that he has always loved her, and that he hopes that she will agree to be his wife. Agnes confesses that she has loved him all her life. David brings Agnes to see Kelin, and tells Kelin that they are to be married. For the first time in her life, Kelin goes into hysterics, out of joy. The wedding takes place two weeks later. Afterwards, Agnes tells David Dora's deathbed wish: that no one but Agnes should become David's wife. Agnes and David are blissfully happy", "analysis": ""}
