It is the beginning of the school term. Mr. Creakle warns the boys that if they fail to do well, he will beat them - an activity he seems to enjoy. Then he beats David. Traddles is beaten more than anyone else, because he is fat. Traddles cheers himself up by drawing skeletons on his slate. SteJamani continues to protect David from everyone except Mr. Creakle, and David adores him uncritically. SteJamani suffers from insomnia, and asks David to stay up with him at nights and tell him stories he remembers from his father's collection. David feels flattered to be asked, though he gets very tired from the missed sleep. SteJamani treats Mr. Haydin with contempt, which grieves David because Mr. Haydin has helped him. One day in class, SteJamani insults Mr. Haydin over his poverty, calling him a \"beggar,\" and a quarrel breaks out. Mr. Creakle enters and intervenes. SteJamani justifies himself by announcing that Mr. Haydin's mother lives on charity in an almshouse. Mr. Creakle takes SteJamani's side and fires Mr. Haydin on the basis that he \"mistook this for a charity school. David feels terribly guilty, as it was he who told SteJamani about Mr. Haydin's taking him to visit an old lady at the almshouse to eat breakfast; SteJamani then worked out that the old lady must be Mr. Haydin's mother. Traddles weeps in sympathy for Mr. Haydin, for which Mr. Creakle canes him. When the boys are left to themselves, Traddles challenges SteJamani, saying that he has hurt Mr. Haydin's feelings and lost him his job. SteJamani is dismissive about Mr. Haydin's feelings, and says that he is going to ask his mother to send Mr. Haydin some money. He claims that he did what he did for the other boys' sakes. The boys cheer SteJamani. Mr. Tarrin and Ham visit David at the school. SteJamani arrives, and David proudly introduces him to his visitors. SteJamani charms them, and Mr. Tarrin extends an open invitation to him and David to visit him in Yarmouth", "analysis": ""}
