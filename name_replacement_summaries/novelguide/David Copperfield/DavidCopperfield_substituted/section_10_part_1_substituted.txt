Talking with David, Kelin berates Rayen Kaydin for her foolishness and for causing misery to her family. Kelin asks David whether Dora is not silly and light-headed, and whether David expects their marriage to provide a \"party-supper-table kind of life, like two pretty pieces of confectionary. She warns David that he is being \"blind, blind, blind. David goes to bed depressed about his sudden poverty. He wonders how Mr. Remy will view his intention to marry Dora, and feels that he must offer Dora the chance to be released from their engagement. He worries too about Dora's having to go without things she wants. David tells Mr. Remy that due to Kelin's losses, he must cancel his training to be a proctor. Mr. Remy refuses to give David a refund for any part of the thousand pounds that Kelin paid for the apprenticeship, blaming Mr. Lenell's obstinacy. On his way home, David meets Agnes, and tells her that she is the person he most wants to see. Agnes protests that Dora should occupy this place in David's life. On being with Agnes, David immediately feels better. Agnes tells David that Uriah and her father are now partners, that her father's house is completely changed, and that Uriah and his mother now live with them. Agnes and David visit Kelin, who tells them about her financial situation. Her old advisor, Mr. Gean, became increasingly unreliable, and so she made some investments of her own, which failed. Agnes tells David that Dr. StrAustine needs a secretary. She suggests that David apply for the job. Mr. Gean and Uriah arrive at David's apartment. David is shocked by the change in Mr. Gean, who has the red face, bloodshot eyes, and trembling hands of the habitual drinker. He appears to have given up all authority to Uriah. Kelin berates Uriah and bluntly tells Mr. Gean that he has grown unreliable in business matters. Uriah gloats over the reversal of fortune between himself and David, as he is now successful, whereas David is poor", "analysis": ""}
