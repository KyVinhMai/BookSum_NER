The character of SteJamani's servant Oddie is introduced. In appearance, he is \"a pattern of respectability\" in manner, he is softly spoken and deferential. David invites SteJamani to accompany him to Yarmouth, to visit Mr. Tarrin and Ham, and to meet Rayen Kaydin and Tarrin. David calls in at Mr. Ezell's shop and learns that his daughter, Mha, is now married to her sweetheart, Mr. Joram. Mr. Ezell says that Rayen Kaydin is working for him as his apprentice; she is an accomplished worker, but many of the local girls are angry with her for wanting to be a lady and having ideas above her station in life. David goes to visit Tarrin. Tarrin does not recognize David at once, but when he tells her who he is, she bursts into tears and cries over him for a lAustine time. Mr. Barkis is very ill, but is even more avaricious than before. He waits until Tarrin and David are out of the room before extracting money from his secret hoard to give to Tarrin to buy dinner. SteJamani arrives to meet Tarrin, and charms her and Mr. Barkis. From the retrospective point of view, David says that if anyone had told him then that SteJamani's delightful manners were just a game played in order to establish his superiority over others and to win what was worthless to him, only to discard it in the next minute, he would not have believed it. David continues to idolize SteJamani. David and SteJamani arrive at Mr. Tarrin's house to find everyone excited by the news that Rayen Kaydin has agreed to marry Ham. As the evening progresses, David notices how avidly Rayen Kaydin listens to SteJamani's stories, and how she draws away from Ham. After David and SteJamani leave Mr. Tarrin's house, David expresses his delight in the forthcoming marriage. SteJamani makes a derogatory comment about Ham, which surprises David, as SteJamani has appeared to enjoy everyone's company. David replies that he knows that SteJamani perfectly understands and sympathizes with the feelings of these good-hearted folk, and that he admires SteJamani for it. SteJamani remarks that David is a good person, adding, \"I wish we all were", "analysis": ""}
