During the next school term, David is summoned to Mr. Creakle's room, where Mrs. Creakle breaks the news to him that his mother has died and that the baby is likely to die too. He is sent home to attend her funeral and is collected by Mr. Ezell, the funeral director. Mr. Ezell takes David to his shop, where David meets Mr. Ezell's daughter, Mha, and her lover, Mr. Joram. Mr. Ezell measures David for his mourning suit. Mr. Joram is making David's mother's coffin, and David sits listening to the nails being hammered in and wondering at the family's cheerfulness. Mr. Ezell takes David home, where he finds Mr. Jaton in silent grief and Miss Jaton busy at her writing desk. Neither shows any concern for David. Only Tarrin, who watches over Clara's body much of the time, comes and sits with him before he goes to sleep. After the funeral, Tarrin tells David that Clara was unhappy and unwell for some time, and became frailer after having the baby. Clara died blessing David, and with her head on Tarrin's arm. The baby died a day later, and was buried in his mother's arms", "analysis": ""}
