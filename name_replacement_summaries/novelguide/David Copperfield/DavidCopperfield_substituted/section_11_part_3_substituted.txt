Dora's aunts reply to David's letter, saying that he is welcome to visit and discuss his hopes of marrying Dora. David sets off, taking Traddles with him. Traddles tells David that his fiance's family is not enthusiastic about their plans to marry, as Suneetha is so useful to them. They take consolation in the uncertainty of Traddles's finances, which are delaying the marriage. David and Traddles arrive at the house of Dora's aunts, who are called Lavinia and Clarissa. The aunts tell David that they do not doubt David's feelings for Dora and have no objection to his courting her, though they would prefer not to recognize any formal engagement until they have had the chance to observe the pair. David perceives that the aunts will take pleasure in supervising the romance between him and Dora. He joyfully agrees to their terms. The aunts allow David to see Dora alone. Dora's main concerns are her fear of Traddles and of Kelin. When David tries to get Dora to meet Traddles, she runs off and locks herself in her room.
