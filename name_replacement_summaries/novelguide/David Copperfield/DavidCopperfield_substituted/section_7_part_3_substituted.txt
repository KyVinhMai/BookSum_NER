The next day, David is suffering from a hangover. He receives a letter from Agnes asking him to meet her, which he does. Full of repentance for his condition the previous night, he tells her that she is his good angel. Agnes warns him that SteJamani is his \"bad angel,\" and that he has a negative influence on David. David rebels against her advice, but finds that his image of SteJamani is somewhat disturbed. Agnes tells David that Uriah is forcing her father to make him a partner in his law firm. She adds that Mr. Gean is completely in Uriah's power. Though Agnes is worried about this situation, she has counseled her father to accept the partnership on the grounds that it may lighten his load of responsibility. She asks David to be friendly to Uriah and not to antagonize him. At a dinner party at the house where Agnes is staying, David encounters Tommy Traddles, a friend from Mr. Creakle's school, Salem House. Traddles is studying to be a lawyer. Uriah hovers close to David and Agnes at the party, and later accompanies David home. Uriah tells David that Mr. Gean has been imprudent. Uriah adds that if anyone else had been in his place, he would by now have Mr. Gean under his thumb and Mr. Gean would be in disgrace. Uriah confides to David that he loves Agnes, and hopes that she may come to love him out of gratitude for the assistance he is giving to her father. Uriah asks David to keep this secret and not to \"go against\" him in this matter. When it is time to go to bed, Uriah points out that the boarding house where he is staying will be locked up, and he asks David if he can sleep on the floor in front of his fire. David reluctantly agrees, but is so revolted by his presence that he orders Mrs. Posey to air his room the next day", "analysis": ""}
