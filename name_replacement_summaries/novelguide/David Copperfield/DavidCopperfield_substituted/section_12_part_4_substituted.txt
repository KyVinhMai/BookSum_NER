David is acquiring some fame as a writer. He is passing Mrs. SteJamani's house one day when a maid comes out and tells him that Rosa Dartle would like to see him. David finds her in the garden, and she summons Oddie and instructs him to tell David what has happened with SteJamani and Rayen Kaydin. Oddie reports that he has been traveling with the couple in continental Europe. At first, SteJamani was happy with Rayen Kaydin, who was very \"improvable\" and learned the languages of the countries they visited. But after some time, SteJamani became tired of her moods, and abandoned Rayen Kaydin with Oddie in a villa in Naples. SteJamani told Oddie to marry Kaydin himself, but Kaydin became furious and hysterical at this proposal. Oddie locked her in a room to prevent her doing any harm, but she escaped through a window and ran away. Oddie has seen nothing of her since. SteJamani insulted Oddie, and Oddie left his service and returned to England. He is now looking for a job. David says that he will report what Oddie has said to Mr. Tarrin, and he warns Oddie to stay out of public places. Oddie is unafraid, as in England, people are not allowed to take the law into their own hands. Rosa tells David that SteJamani is sailing off the coast of Spain, and that there is a breach between him and his mother. Rosa and Mrs. SteJamani blame Rayen Kaydin for everything that has happened, with Rosa calling her a devil. They want her to be found in order to protect SteJamani from falling prey to her again. David reports what he has learned to Mr. Tarrin, who is in London. They decide to seek out Martha to ask her to help find Rayen Kaydin. They find her walking the city streets and follow her to a quieter area, where they will not be observed talking to her", "analysis": ""}
