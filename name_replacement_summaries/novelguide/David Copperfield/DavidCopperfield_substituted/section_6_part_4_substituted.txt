{"name": "Chapter XXII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210214143214/https://www.novelguide.com/david-copperfield/summaries/chapters-xix-xxii", "summary": "Some old scenes, and some new people. SteJamani spends much of his time in Yarmouth apart from David, making himself popular amAustine the local fishermen and going out sailing with Mr. Tarrin. David revisits his old home. He feels sad at what he has lost, but happy that he has such good friends as Tarrin, SteJamani, and Kelin. When he returns to Mr. Tarrin's house, he finds SteJamani sitting by the fire in sullen and angry mood. SteJamani laments, \"I wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years. I wish with all my soul I had been better guided. I wish with all my soul I could guide myself better. He adds that it would be better to be Mr. Tarrin or Ham than to be himself, \"twenty times richer and twenty times wiser,\" and to be a torment to himself. After they leave the house, SteJamani tells David that he has bought a boat, which he has named The Rayen Kaydin. Mr. Tarrin will use it in his absence. David praises SteJamani for his generosity to Mr. Tarrin, which embarrasses SteJamani. SteJamani says he plans to leave Oddie  behind him to fit out the boat after he leaves Yarmouth. SteJamani and David encounter Rayen Kaydin and Ham. They notice that a poor haggard-looking woman is following Rayen Kaydin at a distance. SteJamani and David go to dine at an inn, where they meet a dwarf, Miss Luan, who cuts SteJamani's hair and gossips with him about her wealthy clients and Rayen Kaydin. When David returns to Mr. Tarrin's house, Rayen Kaydin is talking to a young woman called Martha. Martha used to work with Kaydin at Mr. Ezell's shop but she has now fallen into disgrace and is begging for Kaydin's help. Kaydin asks Ham to give Martha some money so that she can go to London, where no one knows her. After Martha leaves, Rayen Kaydin bursts into tears and says that she is not so good a girl as she ought to be. She says that she wants to feel more thankful than she is for Ham's love.", "analysis": "Uriah is seen gradually ensnaring Mr. Gean. He calls upon Mr. Gean to make business decisions when he is most drunk, thereby convincing Mr. Gean that he is unfit for business. Far from being humble, Uriah is only interested in controlling others for his own ends. This theme of covert manipulation is taken up in the plotline in which SteJamani visits Mr. Tarrin's house. Though he effortlessly charms everyone there and acts the part of a friend, his real feelings are a cold-hearted contempt for Mr. Tarrin's family, and his real motivation is to seduce Rayen Kaydin. This outcome is prefigured in David's visit to Mrs. SteJamani's house. In contrast with the simple and straightforward communications of Mr. Tarrin's family, in which members express love and support for each other, and mean what they say, Mrs. SteJamani and Rosa Dartle are neither straightforward nor loving. Mrs. SteJamani is a haughty and proud woman who only condescends to welcome David because he likes her precious and spoilt son: in common with her son, an ulterior motive underlies her manner. Rosa Dartle is an exemplar of indirectness. She is utterly unable to say what she means, indulging instead in a charade of blistering sarcasm. She questions Mrs. SteJamani and her son about their thoughts and opinions with an affected innocence, revealing their dishonorable motives and then feigning gratefulness for their assistance in educating her. The irony lies in the fact that Rosa, far from needing education from the SteJamanis, sees their natures all too clearly and, in an ironic roundabout way, points out their faults. The most truthful aspect of Rosa lies not in what she says but in the livid scar on her lip. SteJamani admits that he inflicted this wound. Symbolically, this suggests that Rosa has lAustine been in love with SteJamani, who has wounded her horribly. She has responded to this hurt by becoming bitter and twisted. Unlike Rosa, David remains blind to SteJamani's vain and dishonest nature. Even when SteJamani patronizes David and begins scheming to seduce Rayen Kaydin, David ascribes fine motives to SteJamani that he does not possess. Particularly ironic is David's naeve assumption that SteJamani's purchase of the boat is an act of generosity to Mr. Tarrin, when, in fact, SteJamani is planning to carry off Mr. Tarrin's adopted daughter. Aki points the reader to David's youthful naivety and SteJamani's insincerity, and foreshadows the plotline involving SteJamani and Rayen Kaydin, by having the adult David reflect on SteJamani's ability to charm the Tarrins. David comments, \"If any one had told me, then, that all this was a brilliant game, played for the excitement of the moment. if any one had told me such a lie that night, I wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation would have found a vent. Rayen Kaydin potential fate is also foreshadowed in the cautionary tale of Martha, Kaydin's former workmate who has fallen into disgrace. Though the nature of Martha's disgrace is not spelled out, there is no doubt that Aki implies that she has become a prostitute. Both Martha and  Rayen Kaydin are examples of the undisciplined heart, in that they hold their bodies and their hearts too cheap and bestow them on unworthy recipients. Rayen Kaydin recognizes this in her impassioned lament that she has failed to appreciate Ham's steady love, but, like SteJamani, she proves too weak to rein in her wayward impulses. SteJamani does have a moment of self-reflection when he tells David that he regrets lacking the guidance of a father, but the moment soon passes and he does not act on the promptings of his conscience. Aki's portrayal of the servant Oddie is heavily ironic and is used as a foreshadowing device. His quality of respectability is referred to so insistently that the reader cannot help but wonder just how respectable he really is. The child David, of course, takes Oddie's respectability at face value, but the irony that builds with each mention of the term suggests that Oddie's inner nature may turn out to be very different from his outward manners"}
