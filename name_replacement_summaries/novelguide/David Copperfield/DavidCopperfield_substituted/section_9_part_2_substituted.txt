David still loves SteJamani, though he recognizes his unworthiness and knows that they will never renew their friendship. Mr. Tarrin tells David that if he should ever meet SteJamani, he will kill him. He plans to begin his search for Rayen Kaydin in London. Mrs. Maddyx promises to stay and look after the house and keep it ready in case Rayen Kaydin returns. David is sought out by Miss Luan, who is in great distress over the part she unknowingly played in Rayen Kaydin's fate. When David expresses surprise that she is upset, she launches into a speech defending herself against popular prejudice, saying that it is not her fault that she was born a dwarf and that she has to affect a tough manner in order to survive in the world. She explains that Oddie told her that it was David who was in love with Rayen Kaydin. Oddie convinced her that Kaydin was in danger from David, and that SteJamani was trying to warn Kaydin of this. Thus, Miss Luan was persuaded to carry a letter from SteJamani to Rayen Kaydin, which marked the beginning of their affair. Miss Luan says she hopes that David believes her, advising him never to \"associate bodily defects with mental. David says that he does believe her, and that they were both innocent instruments of SteJamani. The next day, David and Mr. Tarrin travel to London. They visit Mrs. SteJamani. Mr. Tarrin gives her Rayen Kaydin's letter to read, and asks her if SteJamani is likely to keep his word and marry Kaydin. Mrs. SteJamani is unmoved by the letter and says it is out of the question for her son to marry a girl who is socially so inferior to him. She hints at her willingness to offer Mr. Tarrin money in compensation, but he refuses. Then, in an angry outburst, she voices her fury against her son, saying that he must get rid of Rayen Kaydin if he ever hopes to be forgiven. David realizes that SteJamani and his mother are alike in their unyielding spirits. Mrs. SteJamani dismisses Mr. Tarrin and David. As they are leaving, Rosa Dartle reproaches David for bringing Mr. Tarrin to the house. Rosa calls SteJamani corrupt, but says she cares nothing for Mr. Tarrin or his \"common niece. Mr. Tarrin sets off to look for Rayen Kaydin", "analysis": ""}
