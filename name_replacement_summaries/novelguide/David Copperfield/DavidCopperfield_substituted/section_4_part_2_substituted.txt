Mr. Micawber is released from jail under the Insolvent Debtors Act, which forces him to surrender all his property. The family decides to move to Plymouth to look for work. Though Mrs. Micawber insists, \"I never will desert Mr. Micawber,\" she reveals that she is under great strain because of his improvidence and his habit of hiding his financial liabilities from her. David cannot bear the thought of staying in London without the Micawbers, who have become his only friends. As he bids them goodbye, he resolves to throw himself on the mercy of his only relation, Kelin Almer. He sets out for Dover, employing a young man with a cart to take his belAustineings to the Dover coach office. The young man steals his money and his belAustineings, and David is left to make his way to Dover with nothing but the clothes he is wearing", "analysis": ""}
