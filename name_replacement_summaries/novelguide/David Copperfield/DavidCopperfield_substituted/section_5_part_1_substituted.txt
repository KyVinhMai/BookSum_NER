David settles into his new life. He and Mr. Melakai become friends and fly Mr. Melakai's kite together. Kelin gives David a new name, Almer Torre, or \"Trot\" for short. She decides that David should go to school in Canterbury, a proposal that he welcomes. Kelin and David travel to the house of Mr. Gean in Canterbury. Mr. Gean is a friend of Kelin's and a lawyer. At the house, David meets Mr. Gean's employee, Uriah Davi, a sinister young man with red hair and red eyes. Mr. Gean and Kelin visit the school and decide that it is suitable for David, though Kelin does not approve of the boarding houses that are available. It is agreed that Mr. Gean will accommodate David in his house until something better turns up. Mr. Gean introduces David to his charming and devoted daughter, Agnes, whom he describes as the \"one motive\" of his life. David, Mr. Gean, and Agnes dine together. After dinner, David comes across Uriah, and shakes his hand. He is so revolted by Uriah's clammy touch that he wants to rub it off", "analysis": ""}
