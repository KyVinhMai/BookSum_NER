Mr. Barkis has hoarded a small fortune during his lifetime, and leaves Tarrin a generous sum. He also leaves some money to Mr. Tarrin. David uses his training as a proctor to execute the will. The adult David interrupts his narration to say that he fears to tell what happened next, as it is too painful to recall. He persuades himself to go on with his story only because whether he writes about it or not, he cannot change the outcome. David arrives at Mr. Tarrin's house, where Mr. Tarrin, Tarrin, and Mrs. Maddyx are expecting Ham and Rayen Kaydin. Ham arrives, without Kaydin. A distraught Ham says that Rayen Kaydin has run away, and is heading for such disgrace that it would be better for her if she were to die. Ham shows David a letter from Rayen Kaydin saying that she will never return home, unless the man she is with makes her a lady and brings her back. She writes that she is wicked, that she does not deserve Ham's love, and that they must all forget her. Ham reveals that the man with whom Kaydin has run away is SteJamani. Mr. Tarrin vows to search for Kaydin, throughout the world if necessary. David feels terrible guilt that he introduced SteJamani into the family. Everyone is in tears", "analysis": ""}
