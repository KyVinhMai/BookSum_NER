{"name": "Chapter LX", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210214143214/https://www.novelguide.com/david-copperfield/summaries/chapters-lix-lxiv", "summary": "Agnes. David visits Kelin, who reports that Mr. Micawber is happy in Australia and has begun to pay off his debt to her. Mr. Melakai is still doing his copying work, which keeps all thoughts of King Charles I out of his head. Mr. Gean has recovered his former contentment, and Agnes is prospering with her school. David asks whether Agnes has a lover. Kelin replies that she suspects that she does love someone, though she does not say whom. Agnes greets David with her usual serene happiness. She tells him that she and her father have regained their home and that she loves her work. David tries to lead on to the subject of her sweetheart, but Agnes seems uneasy, and he lets it go. Mr. Gean tells David about Agnes's mother, who married against her father's wishes. He renounced her, and it broke her heart; she died of grief when Agnes was two weeks old. Mr. Gean says that since then, Agnes has been everything to him. David recalls that on the night Dora died, Agnes came downstairs and pointed upwards. She was indicating Dora, but David tells Agnes that he feels the gesture symbolically showed that she always leads him to higher things. He tells her that he will always love her and view her as his guide", "analysis": ""}
