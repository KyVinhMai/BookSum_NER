When Dora is staying at Julia Mills's house, David tells her that he is now poor. At first Dora does not believe him, but when she realizes that he is serious, she cries. David finally manages to soothe her, as one might soothe a child. She refuses to hear any more about David's poverty or the practical questions of how they will manage, saying that it frightens her. He tries to persuade her to learn a little about housekeeping, keeping accounts, and cookery, but she becomes hysterical and begs for Julia. Julia calms Dora and tells her that all that matters is that they love each other. David asks Julia if he was right to suggest that Dora learn housekeeping skills. Julia says that this is not appropriate for Dora, who is \"a thing of light, and airiness, and joy. David asks Julia to take charge of the cookery book and encourage Dora to read it. Julia agrees to try, though she is not hopeful", "analysis": ""}
