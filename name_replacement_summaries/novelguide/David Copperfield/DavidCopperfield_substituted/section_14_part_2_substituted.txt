A grief-stricken David decides to go abroad for a time. Mr. Micawber makes arrangements to pay back Kelin's loan. All the Micawbers are studying farming in preparation for their new life working the land in Australia. Mrs. Micawber thinks that when her husband becomes financially successful there, her family will be reconciled to him. Traddles reports that without the influence of Uriah, Mr. Gean has improved, and that Mr. Melakai has been helping him sort out his affairs. Traddles says that he can recover all of Kelin's and Mr. Gean's money. Traddles discusses with Agnes how they will live if Mr. Gean winds up his business, and Agnes says that she plans to rent out their house and run a school. Traddles says that Uriah has left town with his mother, and that no one knows where he is. Traddles believes he acted not so much out of avarice, but hatred for David. Kelin arranges with Traddles to pay Mr. Micawber's debts. The next day, Kelin takes David to the funeral of her husband, who died in hospital. Before he died, he repented his treatment of Kelin and asked to see her; she had gone and spent time with him", "analysis": ""}
