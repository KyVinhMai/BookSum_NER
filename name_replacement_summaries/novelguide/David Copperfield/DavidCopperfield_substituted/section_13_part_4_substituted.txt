Mr. Tarrin tells David and Kelin Rayen Kaydin's story after she escaped from Oddie. Hysterical, she ran to a beach, believing that her home was there, and collapsed. She was rescued by a local woman, who looked after her until she recovered. Rayen Kaydin went to France and thence to England. She intended to go home, but her courage failed her, as she feared she might not be forgiven. She went to London, where she met a woman who promised to give her respectable work involving needlework, and who took her in. Martha discovered her, and rescued her. Mr. Tarrin says that he and Rayen Kaydin will emigrate to Australia, where she can make a fresh start. Tarrin intends to stay in England, and look after Ham. Mr. Tarrin means to provide a separate home for Mrs. Maddyx, whom he believes to be too difficult a character to impose upon Tarrin. David accompanies Mr. Tarrin to Yarmouth, where he will say goodbye to his household. David calls in on Mr. Ezell, whose legs are failing. David tells him that with Martha's help, Rayen Kaydin has been restored to her uncle. Mr. Ezell is happy at this news, and offers to help Martha financially. David proceeds to Ham's house, where Tarrin now lives. Tarrin tells David that she believes Ham to be broken-hearted, though he still works hard. Ham takes David aside and asks him to beg Rayen Kaydin to forgive him for imposing his love on her. If he had not done so, he believes that she might have confided in him as a friend, and he could have saved her. Ham also wants David to tell her that he will always love her. Mrs. Maddyx asks Mr. Tarrin if she can accompany him and Rayen Kaydin to Australia, and he agrees. Mr. Tarrin shuts up his house", "analysis": ""}
