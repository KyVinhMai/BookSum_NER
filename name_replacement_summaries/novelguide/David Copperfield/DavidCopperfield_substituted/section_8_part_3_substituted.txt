David accompanies SteJamani to Mrs. SteJamani's home. While SteJamani is occupied with his mother, Rosa Dartle asks David why he has been keeping SteJamani so engrossed that he has not been home. When David protests that he has not seen SteJamani until last night, Rosa is shocked. She questions David about what SteJamani is doing, but David can tell her nothing. She says that if SteJamani and his mother were ever to quarrel, they would be hard to reconcile, since they are both too proud to give in. SteJamani is charming to Rosa, and proposes that they will love each other very much in the future. Rosa, furious, strikes him and storms out of the room. That night, David says goodbye to SteJamani. SteJamani says that he wishes that David could call him by the nickname he gave David, Daisy. He asks that if anything should separate them, David should think of him at his best. David tells SteJamani that he will always love him", "analysis": ""}
