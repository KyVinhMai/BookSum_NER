Lady Russell consults Anne, who has no puffed up sense of pride that prevents her from suggesting stringent measures. Anne's plan would see the estate debt-free in seven years. Anne, unlike her father and Elizabeth, feels it is their duty to pay their debts. However, Sir Walter and Elizabeth balk at such measures as giving up their horses and carriage, their lavish meals, their trips to London, and so forth. The only measure that seems possible is to \"quit Kellynch-hall\" altogether. It is decided that the family will rent Kellynch-hall to someone respectable, while they in turn move to Bath, where Sir Walter can \"there be important at comparatively little expense. Anne hates to leave the country, but her opinion is not counted. Lady Russell supports this plan, despite Anne's reservations, because she also wishes to remove Elizabeth from her growing intimacy with Mr. Shepherd's daughter, Mrs. Clay, whom she considers beneath Elizabeth's notice. Mrs. Clay, who has returned to her father's house \"after an unprosperous marriage,\" has wormed herself into Elizabeth's confidence through flattery and quite displaced Anne as the proper confidante for Elizabeth", "analysis": ""}
