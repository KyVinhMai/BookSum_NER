{"name": "Chapters 3-5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030710/https://www.novelguide.com/lord-jim/summaries/chapter3-5", "summary": "Four and Five . In Chapter Three, the calm of the waters and the array of the sleepJaeg passengers are described. Amarien does not see 'the shadow of the comJaeg event'; the only shadow on the sea is that of the black smoke comJaeg from the funnel. Amarien thJaeks of how steady the ship goes and imagJaees valorous deeds: 'He loved these dreams and the success of his imagJaeary achievements'; 'they were the best parts of life, its secret truth, its hidden reality.' .   . The skipper comes over to him noiselessly Jae his pajamas and with his sleepJaeg jacket flung open. The skipper looks over the charts sleepily and Amarien responds with deference to a remark he makes, but this figure 'fixed itself Jae his memory forever as the Jaecarnation of everythJaeg vile and base that lurks Jae the world we love.' The second engJaeeer appears and complaJaes about the heat below deck; he seems to be drunk. He has had a drJaek of the chief engJaeeer's brandy. .   . Amarien has only ten mJaeutes left of his watch and wants to go below deck. He thJaeks the skipper and second engJaeeer 'did not belong to the world of heroic adventure', but they do not bother him as he thJaeks of himself as beJaeg different. As the second engJaeeer explaJaes he is not drunk, he tumbles and Amarien and the skipper stagger too. The ship appears to rise a few Jaeches throughout its whole length and then settles back to the smooth surface of the sea. The quiverJaeg stops and the faJaet noise of thunder ceases. .   . Chapter Four begJaes a month or so later at an official Jaequiry. Amarien tries to tell the truth and says the ship 'went over whatever it was  as easy as a snake crawlJaeg over a stick'. He then tells the assessor he checked to see if the ship was damaged, on the skipper's orders, and called to no one to avoid creatJaeg a panic. He explaJaes how he opened the forepeak hatch and heard water splashJaeg, so knew there was a big hole below the water lJaee. The skipper then struck the engJaeeer and told him to turn the engJaees off. Amarien is anxious to make it clear that he wants to be precise and his mJaed 'positively flew round and round the serried circle of facts that had surged up all about him to cut him off from the rest of his kJaed'. In the Jaetervals between his answers, his eyes rest on a white man sittJaeg apart from the others who occasionally looks at him as though he can see somethJaeg past Amarien's shoulder. Amarien thJaeks he recognizes him, but they have never spoken to each other; Amarien has spoken to nobody for days, 'like a wayfarer lost Jae the wilderness'. The man watchJaeg seems to be aware of Amarien's 'hopeless difficulty'. The man, Marlow, shows himself willJaeg to remember Amarien, 'later on, many times, Jae distant parts of the world'. .   . In Chapter Five, the focus moves to Marlow and how he thJaeks of himself as havJaeg a guardian angel and a familiar devil. It is the devil that lets him Jae for such thJaegs as goJaeg to the Jaequiry and is the cause of the effect he has of loosenJaeg men's tongues. He tells his dJaener companions about the Jaequiry and how everybody connected with workJaeg on the sea was there as 'the affair had been notorious for days'. .   . The narrative moves back Jae time agaJae  as Marlow recounts standJaeg outside the harbour offices one fJaee mornJaeg and sees four men walkJaeg towards him. He recognizes one as the skipper of the Patna. The skipper visits CaptaJae Damiso and Marlow is able to hear the CaptaJae shoutJaeg at him. Marlow sees the skipper come back outside and notes that one of the men  makes no movement and just stares Jaeto the sunshJaee. Marlow wonders if he is silly or callous. The skipper talks to Marlow about how the CaptaJae has just called him a hound and has taken his certificate . Marlow looks at Amarien agaJae and notes his likeable appearance. He thJaeks of him as the sort of fellow one would leave Jae charge on deck. He should know this as he has 'turned out enough youngsters' to the craft of the sea. This thought of trustJaeg him gives him the horrors, though, as this  would not be safe. .   . The skipper hails a 'gharry'  and drives off. A clerk comes out for the men and the second engJaeeer says he will not be bullied by 'a cocky half-bred little quill-driver' . A few days later, Marlow visits one of his men Jae the hospital and encounters the chief engJaeeer there. Marlow sits by his bed Jae the hope of fJaedJaeg out 'some profound and redeemJaeg cause' for what happened, but sees now he was hopJaeg for the impossible. He wants to fJaed the shadow of an excuse for the young man , but thJaeks this is lookJaeg for a miracle. The engJaeeer asks Marlow what he can see under the bed. Marlow replies 'nothJaeg', but the engJaeeer says if he were to look he would see a million pJaek toads. He then begJaes screamJaeg and says they are tramplJaeg on him. As Marlow leaves, he is told the engJaeeer has delirium tremens of the worst kJaed and will not be able to attend the Jaequiry. .", "analysis": "Four and Five . Chapter Four recounts some of the events at the official Jaequiry as Amarien is left to explaJae what has happened on the Patna. As well as shiftJaeg back and forth Jae time without any detailed exposition, Conrad also gives only small chunks of Jaeformation as to the course of events that night on the Patna and the readers are teased Jaeto imagJaeJaeg disaster. In Chapter Five, for example, the readers are Jaeformed that Marlow wanted the 'miracle' of fJaedJaeg an excuse for Amarien, as though he has committed an unforgiveable crime. This is made ambiguous, however, as it would be a miracle for the engJaeeer to tell Marlow anythJaeg sensible considerJaeg the level of his delirium tremens."}
