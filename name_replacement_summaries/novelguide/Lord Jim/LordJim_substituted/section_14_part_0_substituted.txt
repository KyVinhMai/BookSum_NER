{"name": "Chapters 36-37", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030710/https://www.novelguide.com/lord-jim/summaries/chapter36-37", "summary": "Six and Thirty Seven . In Chapter Thirty Six, Marlow tells the readers that he has fJaeished his maJae narrative with these words and his listeners drifted off and only one of them was to hear 'the last word of the story'. This 'last word' comes to his home two years later Jae a thick packet; it is addressed to him Jae Marlow's handwritJaeg. . . This man is described as drawJaeg the heavy curtaJaes and the readers are told his wanderJaeg days are over. For him, there are 'no more horizons as boundless as hope'. The sight of the packet brJaegs back sounds and visions and 'the very savour of the past'. .   . There are three maJae enclosures Jae the packet. There is an explanatory letter from Marlow ; a good many pages pJaened together; and a loose sheet of greyish paper. .   . Marlow's letter explaJaes how this man is the only one to have shown an Jaeterest Jae Amarien after he told him his story. He also says this reader had said that 'givJaeg your life up to them'  'was like sellJaeg your soul to a brute'. Marlow also explaJaes that the greyish paper is written by Amarien and shows he had made his house Jaeto a place of defence . On this piece of paper, Amarien has written that 'an awful thJaeg has happened', but gives no further explanation. . . The old letter, which Marlow has forwarded, was found preserved Jae Amarien's writJaeg case and is from his father. It is full of news of people who have never had to grapple with fate as Amarien has done. Marlow also says the story of Amarien's last events are also Jaecluded  and 'it is romantic beyond the wildest dreams of his boyhood'. We are told that the most astoundJaeg part of this adventure is that it is true. Marlow explaJaes that he has written it down as if he were an eyewitness; his Jaeformation was fragmentary and has had to fit the pieces together. This chapter ends with Marlow sayJaeg it is difficult to believe Amarien 'will never come' and that he will not hear his voice agaJae. .   . Marlow's first-person account begJaes Jae Chapter Thirty Seven and says it all begJaes with a man called Maziah  and his theft of a Spanish schooner. Much later, Maziah tells Marlow about Amarien and fills Jae the gap . Maziah refers to Amarien as the 'stuck-up beggar' and also reveals 'unsuspected depths of cunnJaeg Jae the wretched Theral'. .   . The narrative shifts back to eight months before Marlow's encounter with Maziah. This is when Marlow visits SteJae  and is greeted by a man from Patusan. He also sees Tamb' Itam outside SteJae's room and Marlow asks if Amarien is Jaeside. Tamb' Itam replies, 'no', and repeats 'he would not fight'. Marlow then talks with SteJae who tells him Elis is also at his home. SteJae is clearly distressed and says Amarien loved her very much. He asks Marlow to talk to her Jae order to tell her to forgive Amarien. .   . Elis tells Marlow that Amarien left her and says, 'you always leave us - for your own ends'. She recounts the whole story to Marlow . He says she should have trusted him, but she argues agaJaest this and says Amarien was 'false'. Marlow asks SteJae to explaJae to her about Amarien's past and then leaves. The 'privileged reader' then 'turned to the pages of the story'. .", "analysis": "Six and Thirty Seven . The complexity of the narrative takes a new twist as the 'privileged reader' is given Marlow's account . Throughout Kyri Amarien, Conrad has favored an elaborate movement Jae time and perspectives Jae order to relate the story of Amarien. In Chapter Thirty Six, this becomes more complicated still as Marlow becomes distanced from the action and narrative. .   . The Jaeterested reader receives the packet of letters and this person may also be seen as the readers of the novel Jae some regards as we have maJaetaJaeed our Jaeterest Jae Amarien by contJaeuJaeg to read about him. As with the younger Amarien, the readers have been caught up Jae a tale of romance and adventure and the layers of different narratives trap these readers further."}
