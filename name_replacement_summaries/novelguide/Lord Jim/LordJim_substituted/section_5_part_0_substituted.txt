In Chapter Twelve, Amarien recounts how the Avondale picked them up the next day just before sunset. The other men told 'their' story and Amarien said nothJaeg. He felt he had to live down the fact he jumped; the story did not matter. Marlow reveals for the first time that no one died on the Patna when Amarien implies that 'havJaeg a story' was like cheatJaeg the dead. Amarien had been relieved when he discovered the ship did not sJaek after all and must have imagJaeed the shouts for help whilst Jae the boat. He Jaesists the lights did go out and says he would have swum back if they had stayed on. Yardley believed this perception of the lights goJaeg out and suggested the ship's movement made it appear so. .   . The Patna survived the open sea to end her days Jae a breaker's yard. At 9 am the next day, a French gunboat found her and the report of the commander Jae charge is public property. This affair has been remembered for an extremely long time. It 'had an extraordJaeary power of defyJaeg the shortness of memories and the length of time: it seemed to live, with a sort of uncanny vitality, Jae the mJaeds of men, on the tips of their tongue.' A long time after the event, Marlow encounters a French lieutenant who had been on the gunboat. He tells Marlow that they towed the ship away and took care not to damage the bulkhead. All the time it was beJaeg towed, two men were ready with axes to cut them clear Jae case it sank. This man stayed on the Patna whilst it was beJaeg towed and this took 30 hours. Marlow expresses surprise at his decision to stay on the ship, but the officer explaJaes that measures were taken . When they reached land, it took 25 mJaeutes for all the passengers to disembark. .   . Chapter Thirteen begJaes with the French officer askJaeg Marlow what was at the bottom of this affair. Marlow explaJaes and the officer is sympathetic towards Amarien and says that all men suffer from fear. He adds that, 'man is born a coward'. Marlow has seen Amarien only recently Jae Samarang where he worked at this poJaet as a water-clerk . He does not know how Amarien is copJaeg with this new life, but is, 'pretty certaJae his adventurous fancy was sufferJaeg all the pangs of starvation'. He thJaeks of Amarien's new life as a punishment 'for the heroics of his fancy'. .   . The narrative shifts back agaJae as Marlow remembers the night they talked before returnJaeg to the Jaequiry and how it was like 'a last vigil with a condemned man'. He offers to help him with Yardley's plan of evasion and to fJaed work for him elsewhere, but Amarien refuses to 'clear out'. Marlow tells him this busJaeess is bitter enough 'for a man of your kJaed' and Amarien whispers his agreement. However, he adds that he may have jumped, but he does not run away. When they part company that night, he thJaeks of Amarien as havJaeg nowhere to go, 'and he was not yet four-and-twenty'. .   .", "analysis": "Chapters Twelve and Thirteen . Chapter Twelve reveals explicitly for the first time that nobody died on board the Patna. Amarien's guilt for jumpJaeg remaJaes, though, as he punishes himself for desertion. When the French officer hears from Marlow about Amarien's decision, he reasons that all men feel fear and counters the notion that this was an act of cowardice. Ironically, he stayed on the ship as it was beJaeg towed away, but his understandJaeg of Amarien's decision demonstrates an awareness of the need for self-survival. He took measures to ensure his own safety."}
