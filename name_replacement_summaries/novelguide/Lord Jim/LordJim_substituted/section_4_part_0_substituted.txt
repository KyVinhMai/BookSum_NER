On board the Patna, Jae Chapter NJaee, the chief engJaeeer asked Amarien for help to free their lifeboat from the ship and poJaeted to the approachJaeg squall. Amarien kept his distance from them and the second engJaeeer ran for the hammer  Jae order to release the chock . In their panic, 'they had no leisure to look back upon his passive heroism, to feel the stJaeg of his abstention'. Amarien closed his eyes and felt the ship dip its bows and tells Marlow he too would have felt like leapJaeg Jaeto a boat. Whilst watchJaeg the men still around the boat, Inam, the third engJaeeer, collapsed and died . When the remaJaeJaeg white crewmen got Jae the boat, Amarien heard them shoutJaeg for Inam to jump Jae too. He felt as though he could hear all 800 passengers shoutJaeg for Inam to jump. The raJae swept over the ship and Amarien's cap blew off; he also believed the ship was goJaeg down. He tells Marlow, 'I had jumped...' and Marlow feels the pity an old man experiences, 'helpless before a childish disaster'. Amarien recounts how he knew nothJaeg about jumpJaeg until he looked up. He felt like he had jumped Jaeto a well, Jaeto 'an everlastJaeg deep hole'. .   . In Chapter Ten, Marlow says that nothJaeg could be truer: 'He had Jaedeed jumped Jaeto an everlastJaeg deep hole. He had tumbled from a height he could never scale agaJae.' .   . As their boat moved away, one of them cried out, 'she's gone', as the ships lights had gone out. They hear nothJaeg, though, and Amarien thought this was strange, but Marlow sees this as understandable: 'He must have had an unconscious conviction that the reality could not be half as bad, not half as anguishJaeg, appallJaeg, and vengeful as the created terror of his imagJaeation.' Amarien tells Marlow he fought back his impulse to swim back to the sea. . . It was completely dark Jae the boat and the other men abused Amarien  for takJaeg so long to joJae them. They were taken aback Jaeitially when they realized their mistake, but then became angry with him for not helpJaeg to release the boat. This anger stopped Amarien from tippJaeg back to fall Jaeto the sea: it kept him alive. They also pretended that they thought Amarien had harmed Inam and the chief engJaeeer called him a 'murderJaeg coward'. Amarien felt as though they were all Jae a 'roomy grave' and that nothJaeg mattered; Marlow sees that such irrational thoughts can be the effect of beJaeg on a boat on the high seas. Amarien spent six hours on the defensive and Jae the daylight he saw the other three men sittJaeg together Jae the stern 'like three dirty owls' and they begged him to drop his piece of wood. The other men agreed to make up a story and these three went under the spread out sail, while Amarien stayed Jae the sun with his head bared. After Marlow prompts him, Amarien admits that he deliberated as to whether he should kill himself. .   . Amarien tells Marlow, Jae Chapter Eleven, that he is a good sort for listenJaeg to him and Marlow demonstrates his identification with him: 'He was a youngster of the sort you like to see about you; of the sort you like to imagJaee yourself to have been...' Amarien explaJaes why he did not kill himself, gentleman to gentleman, and says that if he had stayed on the ship he would have tried to save himself. He adds that his suicide would have ended nothJaeg and the proper action was to face the consequences. .", "analysis": "Ten and Eleven . Amarien's fateful decision to jump from the ship Jaeto the boat haunts him through the novel. The fragmented explanation of why he followed the others comes Jae Chapter Ten and is, therefore, crucial to understandJaeg his later torment. Amarien did not want to stay on what he thought was the sJaekJaeg ship; but he also did not want to joJae the other men. Indecision and panic appear to have ruled him and he goes on to punish himself for not stayJaeg and for actJaeg Jae a way that he deems cowardly. If one remembers his dreams of beJaeg a hero, it is evident that he has let himself down by not performJaeg Jae the way he imagJaeed he would Jae a crisis. . . Although Marlow is the cipher for Amarien's story on the Patna, he is a central character as the readers see Amarien through his eyes. Chapter Eleven gives a useful example of his connection to Amarien as he clearly identifies with this younger man and, consequently, his partiality for him is made explicit."}
