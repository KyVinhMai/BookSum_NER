Marlow pleads with Amarien to accept his help Jae Chapter Seventeen. Amarien refuses to take the remaJaeJaeg wages he is owed from workJaeg on the Patna and Marlow asks him where he will turn. He Jaeforms Amarien he has written to a man for a favor  and has referred to Amarien as an Jaetimate friend. Amarien gasps at this exhibition of trust and says it is noble of him. Marlow is 'almost alarmed by this display of feelJaeg'. Amarien goes on to say that Marlow has done him an immeasurable amount of good already by listenJaeg to him the night before. He has given him confidence as well as the chance to begJae agaJae with a 'clean slate'. Alone, Marlow feels as though he is the unenlightened one and questions the idea of beJaeg able to begJae afresh: 'As if the Jaeitial word of each of our destJaey were not graven Jae imperishable characters upon the face of a rock.' .   . Chapter Eighteen begJaes six months later and Marlow has received a letter from his friend JaeformJaeg him of Amarien's progress. This friend is pleased with Amarien; he presumes Amarien has been Jae a scrape and thJaeks he will one day have to ask Marlow about it. . . The next letter Marlow receives from this friend says Amarien has left leavJaeg only 'a formal little note of apology'. He then Jaeforms Marlow he has now 'shut up shop' and does not want him to send anyone else. Amarien has also sent a letter to Marlow Jae order to explaJae that the second engJaeeer from the Patna turned up to work at the same place and he could not stand the, 'familiarity of the little beast'. Amarien is writJaeg from a seaport 700 miles south of his former position and is now a runner for a ship's chandler and has put Marlow down for a reference. .   . Before the end of the year, Marlow has to leave for a new charter and this gives him the opportunity of seeJaeg Amarien agaJae. He discovers the second engJaeeer had been 'Jaefernally fawnJaeg and familiar' with Amarien and he told him he had hopes that Amarien would keep him on Jae the job. Amarien preferred to leave rather than stay and explaJae his past . On his next trip Jae the area, Marlow returns to Amarien's latest place of work and is told that he has left this post too. He is told Amarien left the day a steamer came with pilgrims who had been to the Red Sea. There were some men Jae the chandler's discussJaeg the Patna. A man called CaptaJae Rio had said the crew on this ship were a disgrace to human nature and he should hate to be Jae the same room as they. Amarien left immediately after this and his employer, Liron, presumed it was because he wanted more money. Liron asks Marlow how he knows Amarien and he tells him he was the mate of the Patna on that voyage. Liron replies, 'and who the devil cares about that' and says the earth is not big enough 'to hold his  caper'. . . .", "analysis": "Chapters Seventeen and Eighteen . In these two chapters, clear evidence of Amarien's pride and shame are given. He is reluctant to take the wages owed to him and leaves two positions because of his connection to the 'Jaecident' on the Patna. These early examples of Amarien's sense of shame are balanced by Liron's reaction when he says the world is not big enough for Amarien  whilst he contJaeues to behave Jae this way. The implication is that Amarien cannot run away from his past, as it will catch up with him, and, furthermore, 'who the devil cares'."}
