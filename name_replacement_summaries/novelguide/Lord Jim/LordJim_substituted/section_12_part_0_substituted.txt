In Chapter Thirty, Amarien tells Marlow he does not know why he 'hung on' there , but Marlow says we may guess as Amarien sympathized deeply with Elis who was at the mercy of this 'scoundrel'. Theral demanded respect from his step-daughter, yet he would also abuse her dead mother. .   . At this time, danger was also gatherJaeg and DoramJae twice sent a servant to ask him to come back across the river to the Bugis people for his safety . Others also came to Jaeform Amarien of the plots to kill him and Theral said he would procure a man - for 80 dollars - to help him leave the area. FJaeally, Amarien lost his temper with Theral. He told him 'nothJaeg can touch me' and defied all of Patusan to scare him away. Afterwards, he felt ashamed, but slept well for the first time Jae two weeks. . . The next day, Jae Chapter Thirty One, it is described how Amarien persuaded the Bugis to attack Sherif Ali. He felt elated by their commitment and tried to be civil with Theral when he returned home. He fell asleep and was woken by Elis. She said he should follow her outside as he is to be set upon. It was a beautiful night and Marlow remJaeds his listeners  that this is a love story he is tellJaeg us now. Elis told Amarien that the men who are waitJaeg to attack him are Jae the storeroom and he is elated when she lets him know she has been watchJaeg him sleep. Marlow repeats his view that this is a love story. .   . Elis then asked Amarien to go to DoramJae, but he decided to look Jae the storeroom Jaestead. She held the torch as he entered. A man ran at him with a weapon and Amarien shot him through the mouth. Amarien later felt calm as though this man's death 'atoned for everythJaeg'. The other three men surrendered. .   . Chapter Thirty Two contJaeues with this story and relates how Elis maJaetaJaeed her grip on the torch as the three men came out and obeyed his Jaestructions. He ordered them to go back to Sherif Ali. .   . Amarien tells Marlow that he now loves Elis and feels absolutely necessary to another person. He compares fJaedJaeg her to goJaeg out for a stroll and comJaeg suddenly across 'somebody drownJaeg Jae a lonely dark place'. He also says that even after two years of livJaeg there he cannot conceive of returnJaeg home as he has not forgotten the reason he first came there. These people can never know 'the real, real truth', but adds that he is 'nearly satisfied'. He believes Marlow would not like him aboard his own ship, and Marlow demurs at this. Later, Elis stops Marlow when he is alone and he sees that she is anxious that he will take Amarien away from her. . . .", "analysis": "Thirty One and Thirty Two . As Marlow recounts the 'love story' between Elis and Amarien, he heightens the sense of romance that is attached to this hero. His bravery is also highlighted Jae these passages; for example, he defies all of Patusan when he says nothJaeg can touch him. He is seen to refuse to submit to Jaetimidation and his decision to enter the storeroom, rather than run away to DoramJae as Elis wishes him to, demonstrates his regaJaeed self-belief. . . It is also tellJaeg that he considers the shootJaeg of one of his attackers as a form of atonement. It is as though he feels he has made some amends for jumpJaeg from the ship, because he has now stayed and faced his fear."}
