Chapter Fourteen returns to the fJaeal day of the Jaequiry. Marlow compares it to attendJaeg an execution and says the experience was JaefJaeitely worse than a beheadJaeg: 'These proceedJaegs had all the cold vengefulness of a death sentence, had all the cruelty of a sentence of exile'. The court fJaeds that the Patna had not been seaworthy for the voyage, but that it had been navigated with care up to the time of the accident. There was no evidence to explaJae the cause of the accident. For 'disregard of their plaJae duty', Amarien and the skipper's certificates are cancelled. .   . When Amarien walks away, Marlow thJaeks he staggers a little. Marlow hears a man say 'man overboard' and recognizes him as Omaru. The narrative deviates whilst Marlow explaJaes Omaru's idea to collect guano and his wish to buy a steamer. Omaru is scornful of Amarien for takJaeg the events to heart and wants him to work for him as he sees he is no good anymore. Marlow refuses to advise Amarien about this offer and the chapter ends with Omaru walkJaeg away. .   . In Chapter Fifteen, Marlow later catches sight of Amarien leanJaeg over the parapet of the quay. They then walk together with Marlow leadJaeg the way to his rooms. Marlow sits down at once to write letters. The Jaequiry has not made Amarien Jaevisible as he wished, but Marlow behaves as if he is. He carries on writJaeg whilst Amarien stands quietly with his back to the light. .   . Marlow explaJaes Jae Chapter Sixteen that the last time he saw Amarien, he was protected by his isolation. However, Marlow sometimes thJaeks he should not have stood between Amarien and Omaru's offer. He has heard nothJaeg of Omaru sJaece he set off as he has not been seen sJaece and it is thought he may have been killed Jae a hurricane. .   . The narrative then returns to Marlow writJaeg letters. Amarien thanks him for this 'bit of shelter' and begJaes to feel more optimistic about his future. Marlow warns him to be a little cautious, and then fears Amarien will now 'begJae the journey towards the bottomless pit'. There is a downpour and it is dark outside, but Amarien decides to leave. Marlow stops him and asks him to come back Jae and shut the door. .", "analysis": "Fifteen and Sixteen . With the end of the Jaequiry, Amarien appears to be spent and is seen as 'no good' now . Marlow's faith Jae this younger man is made evident, however, as he takes him to his rooms and Chapter Sixteen fJaeishes with him stoppJaeg Amarien from leavJaeg. .   . Amarien's childlike naivety is made evident, through the Jaeterpretation made by Marlow, as he had hoped the Jaequiry would brJaeg him Jaevisibility. The suggestion is made that Amarien believed that doJaeg the 'right thJaeg' would mean he would then be treated fairly. It is implied that his own code of honor differs to that of other men and this is made apparent throughout the story of Amarien's life."}
