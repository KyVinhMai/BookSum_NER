The narrative switches back to the time of Amarien's arrival . On his journey up the river, Amarien sat on Marlow's box and held the unloaded revolver. He tells Marlow later that he never felt as depressed and tired as when he was sittJaeg there. When Amarien thought he had arrived, he jumped out and a boat full of armed men appeared alongside him. He was startled and would have shot somebody if his gun had been loaded. Kassim then ran out to him and told him the Rajah wants to see him. .   . Amarien poJaets out to Marlow that if he had been 'wiped out', this place 'would have been the loser'. Amarien tells him this Jae the moonlight and says he is now trusted Jae all the houses.
