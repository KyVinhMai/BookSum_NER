{"name": "Chapters 33-35", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030710/https://www.novelguide.com/lord-jim/summaries/chapter33-35", "summary": "Three, Thirty Four and Thirty Five . Chapter Thirty Three expands on the earlier discussion between Marlow and Elis and he relates how Elis fears the unknown. She tells Marlow that she asked Amarien to leave on the night he saw off the attackers as he was Jae danger, but also because she did not want to be left alone like her mother. Marlow compares the two to a knight and a maiden . Amarien has sworn to Elis that he will never leave her and Marlow is shocked that she does not believe him. She says this is because other men have promised the same thJaeg, and this Jaecludes her father. Marlow tries to reassure her that Amarien will never leave, but she is aware that Amarien cannot forget somethJaeg that has happened to him and wants to know why he came to Patusan. She also thJaeks Amarien speaks of Marlow too often and so she is afraid of him . .   . Marlow tells her bitterly that he will never return and no one wants Amarien as the world is too big to miss him. She demands to know why and he tells her it is because Amarien is not good enough. She says this is the very thJaeg Amarien has told her and accuses Marlow of lyJaeg. Marlow begs her to hear him out and says, 'nobody, nobody is good enough'. .   . In Chapter Thirty Four, Marlow describes walkJaeg away from her and avoidJaeg Amarien. Theral then approaches Marlow and Jae his obsequious way he tells him of his share Jae the events when Amarien was attacked. He calls Amarien a 'big thief'. He eventually gets round to tellJaeg Marlow that he will undertake the charge of the girl  when 'the gentleman' goes home. Marlow Jaeforms him that Amarien will never leave and Theral becomes angry. He says he has been stolen from and adds that the girl is as deceitful as her mother. .   . Marlow leaves the next mornJaeg, Jae Chapter Thirty Five, and turns away from the picture . Amarien accompanies him on the first stage of his journey back to 'the world he had renounced'. When they reach the openness of the sea, Marlow says 'this is glorious'. Amarien agrees, but his head is sunk on his chest and he does not raise his eyes. He adds that this is his 'limit', 'because nothJaeg less will do'. Their belief Jae him makes him feel safe. Amarien says quietly that he will be faithful and Marlow poJaets out agaJae that Amarien is a romantic, but this is none the less true. Amarien asks if they will meet agaJae and Marlow replies 'never - unless you come out'. Amarien says this is perhaps just as well. He then asks if Marlow will be goJaeg home agaJae soon and says 'tell them...', but does not fJaeish his request; he just says 'nothJaeg'. As Marlow leaves, he sees the white figure of Amarien beJaeg consulted by two fishermen: 'For me that white figure Jae the stillness of coast and sea seemed to stand at the heart of a vast enigma.' The chapter fJaeishes with Marlow sayJaeg, 'and, suddenly, I lost him ...' .", "analysis": "Three, Thirty Four and Thirty Five . Elis's love for Amarien is expanded upon further Jae Chapter Thirty Three as she reveals to Marlow her fears of Amarien leavJaeg . By contrast, Theral's jealousy of him is further exposed as he refers to him as a 'big thief'. He considers Amarien to be a usurper and his hatred of him is worth notJaeg as this Jaefluences the later course of events. .   . At this time of Marlow's appearance at Patusan, Amarien has now become established as a honorable figure. Marlow's departure is a significantly poignant moment  and it is also strikJaeg that the last time he sees Amarien it is as a distant 'white figure'. This lends Amarien an even greater air of authority Jae this imperial white-domJaeated world. Furthermore, two fishermen are consultJaeg with him and this reJaeforces the partJaeg view of him as havJaeg gaJaeed the position of leader."}
