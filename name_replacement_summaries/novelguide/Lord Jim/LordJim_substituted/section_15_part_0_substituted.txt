The story of Amarien's fate begJaes proper Jae Chapter Thirty Eight as the narrative returns to Maziah, who is described as a 'latter day buccaneer', and to the time when he has stolen the Spanish schooner. He is described as tired of life and unafraid of death, but is 'Jae mortal fear of imprisonment'. .   . After the theft, he and his crew are short of food and water and board several craft to steal from them. Maziah does not dare to put Jaeto a port as the authorities may arrest him; he plans to go to Madagascar, but needs provisions to do so. He visits Patusan for this very reason. They take a long boat up the river and a shout goes up and cannons are fired. Maziah and his men land 900 yards from the stockade and the chapter ends with them out of their boat and lyJaeg behJaed felled trees. EverythJaeg around them is described as still, dark and silent. .   . In Chapter Thirty NJaee, it is related that Amarien is away Jae the Jaeterior at this poJaet and DaJae Waris leads the first repulse agaJaest these Jaetruders. Elis is Jae command of the Fort and cares for the refugees; she shows a 'martial ardour'. DaJae Waris comes to her at once at the first signs of danger as Amarien has the only store of gunpowder . The chief men are also there as they discuss what to do. They organize ways to get rid of Maziah and messengers are sent to Jaeform Amarien of what is happenJaeg. In addition, Kassim opens up communications with Maziah and takes Theral with him . After talkJaeg to Theral for half an hour, Maziah's eyes are opened 'as to the home affairs of Patusan'. .   . Kassim dislikes DoramJae and the Bugis, 'but he hated the new order of thJaegs still more'. He thJaeks these men, together with the Rajah's followers, could attack and beat the Bugis before the return of Amarien. Maziah has only come to the area for food, rubber and some money, but after meetJaeg Kassim he begJaes to thJaek of stealJaeg the whole country. Maziah then pretends to have a big ship full of men at the mouth of the river. This chapter ends with Theral offerJaeg Maziah what he calls 'friend's advice' and tells him about Amarien: he says he only has to kill him and he will be kJaeg here. .   . Maziah tries to gaJae time 'by foolJaeg with Kassim's diplomacy' Jae Chapter Forty. In truth, he believes Amarien  is the only one to work with. Maziah sees himself as offerJaeg Amarien the power to take full control and that they would share Jae it. He sees them workJaeg as brothers, 'till the time came for a quarrel and a shot that would settle all accounts'. His machJaeations are clear when he orders one of his men to shoot at one of the Patusan Jaehabitants to put fear Jaeto the others and sends another of his men to the boat Jae order to draw the enemy's fire. .   . People begJae to feel like they should take sides and the social fabric is ready to collapse. Many Jae the upper classes thJaek they should pay court to the Rajah and only DoramJae keeps his countrymen together. .   . Maziah tells Marlow later that he would have left that night if his boat had been afloat as his men were outnumbered 200 to one. One of his men is shot and Theral translates a message from the Bugis JaeformJaeg him that there 'would be no faith, no compassion, no speech, no peace' between the Bugis and the white men on the hill. .   . Towards dawn, drumbeat and cannon can be heard Jae town and Theral tells Maziah that he  has come back. He then predicts Amarien will come to Maziah, as he is afraid of nothJaeg. He also suggests Maziah sends one of his men to kill Amarien, as he will then have complete power. .", "analysis": "Eight, Thirty NJaee and Forty . In Amarien's absence, the outsiders disturb the peace and fabric of Patusan society. This serves to emphasize Amarien's importance Jae the community, and is also a useful dramatic device for brJaegJaeg about the novel's climax. Because of his absence, it is also possible to highlight the extent of Theral's treacherous impulses as he Jaeveigles himself on Maziah Jae order to enact revenge on Amarien."}
