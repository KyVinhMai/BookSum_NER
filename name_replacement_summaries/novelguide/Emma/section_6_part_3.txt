He has only praise for Jane, and is disappointed that Emma is annoyed with her. Mr. Knightley then tells Emma that he has some news, but does not have time to tell her what it is, as Miss Bates and Jane enter. They excitedly tell Emma that Mr. Elton is going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. Emma is quite surprised, and is certain that it could not have been a long acquaintance, as he has only been gone four weeks. She also feels that he could not have suffered long over her, and is sorry for how Harriet will take the news. Soon Harriet comes over all excited, and tells Emma that she has just seen Mr. Martin and his sister at the store, and that after talking between themselves quietly they came over to talk to Harriet quite politely. Harriet is quite excited and wants to know what Emma thinks about the whole thing. Emma tries to make it seem like it is not a matter to be dwelt on. She then tells Harriet about Mr. Elton, and she thinks that Harriet does not take the news as bad as she would have if she had not just had the distraction of Mr. Martin", "analysis": ""}
