He has been waiting for her, but now he has to leave, as he needs to go to London to see John and Isabella. Emma is sure he has not forgiven her, but when her father says that she has been at Miss Bates' house, he is instantly relieved. He takes leave of them, and when he takes Emma's hand and almost puts it to his mouth for a kiss, she is sure he forgives her. The following day news arrives that Mrs. Churchill had died. She died from a seizure of a different nature than her lingering illness, but still everyone feels bad that they had never believed in her illnesses before. Emma wonders at how it will affect Frank, as he will be much more free now than he was before. Emma's attentions return to Jane, and she sends a note inviting Jane to Hartfield. A refusal comes, saying that she is too ill. Emma then suggests a ride in the carriage, as perhaps Jane needs some fresh air, and this is also refused. Emma later hears that Jane was seen out walking the same day she invited her out, and Emma realizes that Jane wants no kindness from her", "analysis": ""}
