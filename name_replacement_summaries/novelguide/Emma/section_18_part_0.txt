After a little time alone with Harriet, Emma sees that Mr. Martin has thoroughly taken the place of Mr. Knightley in her thoughts. Emma congratulates her on her engagement to Mr. Martin. Harriet's father turns out to be a tradesman, and not a gentleman, and Emma thinks how bad it could have been if she had married one of the men she had chosen for her. Emma becomes more acquainted with Robert Martin, and her relationship with Harriet naturally lessens. In September Harriet and Mr. Martin are married. Jane has left Highbury and is again with the Campbells. There is to be a mourning period before the marriage. Emma and Mr. Knightley decide to get married in October while John and Isabella are still at Hartfield, but Mr. Woodhouse thinks the plans miserable. Emma does not know what to do. Then Mrs. Weston's poultry-house is robbed, and other poultry-yards are also soon robbed. Mr. Woodhouse thinks of this as house breaking, and is happy to have John Knightley staying at Hartfield. He will soon be returning to London though, and, as Mr. Woodhouse wants the safety of a young man at Hartfield, he agrees to the marriage. The wedding is very nice, but with not too much finery or parade. Mrs. Elton thinks it extremely shabby, and cannot wait to tell her friends about how inferior it was to hers. Despite this, the wishes of all the true friends are there, and the union is quite happy.", "analysis": ""}
