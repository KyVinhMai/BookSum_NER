{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap22-24", "summary": "Mr. Elton comes back to Highbury a happy man, and spreads the news about how charming and beautiful Augusta Hawkins is. The wedding is to be soon, and all expect that the next time Elton returns to Highbury he will bring his new wife with him. Emma barely sees him during this stay in Highbury. She thinks little of the soon-to-be Mrs. Elton, except to note that she brings some money to the marriage, but no name, no blood and no alliance. The entire grandeur of the match seems to be in that Miss Hawkins' sister had made a good match to a man near Bristol. If it did not cause Harriet pain, Emma could almost been amused at how easily she wavers between her anguish over Mr. Martin and Mr. Elton. Miss Martin calls on Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's and leaves a note when she does not find her there. Harriet wants to return the visit, and Emma decides that they will take the carriage and she will drop Harriet off at the Martin's for a short visit before she picks her up again. She will only allow her to be there a short time, so that there is no danger of a rekindling of the friendship between her and Mr. Martin", "analysis": ""}
