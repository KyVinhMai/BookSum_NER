He is always drawing notice of himself to her, and she wonders if her brother-in-law could have been right after all. Emma tries to hear what it is that Mr. Weston is saying about his son Frank Churchill, but she cannot make it out. While Emma has stated that she does not intend to marry, she does take an interest in Frank Churchill. When they are seated for dinner, Mr. Weston tells Emma that they expect Frank to visit them in a fortnight, but Mrs. Weston fears that his aunt will make up some excuse for why he cannot come, as she often seems to do", "analysis": ""}
