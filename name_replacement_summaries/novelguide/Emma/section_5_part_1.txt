She is worried about what her blunders will mean for her friend Harriet. She wonders at how John Knightley noticed Elton's attentions to her when she did not, and how right Mr. Knightley was about Mr. Elton, thinking that the brothers had both warned her. She is convinced of Mr. Elton's arrogance at thinking he could marry her when she was so much his superior, and that his language and manners did not lead her to believe that he was really in love with her. After thinking more about it, she realizes that her attentions to Mr. Elton could be misconstrued, especially since he was looking for encouragement. She realizes that it is foolish of her to meddle in people's lives like this, and resolves not to do it again. She starts to think of whom else could be suitable for Harriet, and then stops herself, realizing her relapse. In the morning Emma feels better, and she is happy to see that there is much snow on the ground, which will hinder any visiting. For days they have to stay at Hartfield, and the evil hanging over Emma of having to tell Harriet what has happened stays with her", "analysis": ""}
