Frank is standing by her, but he seems restless for the appearance of someone else. He passes it off as his excitement to meet Mrs. Elton. When everyone has arrived Frank stays by Emma, and they overhear Mrs. Elton talking to Jane. Frank is surprised when he hears Mrs. Elton call Jane \"Jane,\" instead of Miss Fairfax. Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton start the dancing, and Frank and Emma dance together. All is going well, but Mr. Knightley not dancing with anyone disturbs Emma. The last two dances before supper arrive, and Harriet has no partner for them. Mr. Elton also does not have a partner, and Mrs. Weston suggests he ask Harriet, but he makes up excuses, and Emma notices how gleefully Mr. and Mrs. Elton smile at each other over his slight of Harriet. Emma is quite happy to see Mr. Knightly ask Harriet to dance, and is pleased with his kindness and how well he dances. After supper Emma gets a chance to talk to Mr. Knightley, and he talks about how Mr. Elton's conduct was unpardonable, and how it seemed that Mr. and Mrs. Elton were trying to hurt her as well as Harriet. He asks her to admit that she had wanted Harriet to marry Mr. Elton, and he admits that Emma would have chosen him a better wife than he did, as he found Harriet better than he expected. The dancing begins again, and Emma and Knightley dance together. She says that she guesses that they are not so much brother and sister to make it improper, and he emphatically agrees that they are not brother and sister", "analysis": ""}
