When Emma realizes that the Mr. Martin that Harriet talks about is the son, not the husband, of Mrs. Martin, Emma fears that he has designs on Harriet. She tries to get Harriet to talk about him to see if Harriet has feelings for him. She tries to show Harriet that he is in too low of a station for her, and tells her that she herself cannot associate with them. Emma suggests that Harriet have nothing more to do with the Martins, as she cannot have odd acquaintances if she is to be well connected. The very next day the two young women happen upon Mr. Martin, and after their meeting, Emma is able to talk Harriet into believing that he is not a very remarkable man and that he cannot compare to a man like Mr. Elton. Emma speaks more and more of Mr. Elton to Harriet, as she has him in mind for driving Mr. Martin out of Harriet's thoughts", "analysis": ""}
