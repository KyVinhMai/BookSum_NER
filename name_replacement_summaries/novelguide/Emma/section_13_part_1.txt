Emma does not know what Harriet could have, as he never gave her anything, but the things turn out to be a piece of court-plaster he had played with one day and a pencil stub he had discarded. Harriet had been saving them, and now throws them into the fire. Harriet then says she will never marry, and Emma asks if she is saying this because the person she now prefers is superior to her. Harriet agrees, and says that it is a pleasure just to admire him at a distance, and Emma says that she is not surprised she admires him considering what a service he did her. Harriet agrees, saying that she was miserable, and then she saw him and all was perfect happiness. Emma says to be observant of him, but that she will not interfere, and Harriet is glad she feels that way. They never mention the name of the person they are talking about", "analysis": ""}
