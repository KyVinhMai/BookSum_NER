Mr. Knightley receives a letter from John Knightley in reply to the one that he sent announcing his engagement to Emma. Emma reads it and sees that he thinks that the advantage is all on Emma's side. Emma tells Mr. Knightley that she is sure her father will think the advantage all on his side. The letter also says that Harriet will be staying there a little longer. Emma tells her father that she and Mr. Knightley are going to marry, and she tries to make it sound like the best idea possible that he would come to live with them at Hartfield. He does not like change at all, and so it will take some convincing. Emma tells Mrs. Weston about it, and she tries to convince Mr. Woodhouse, as does Isabella in letters. Mrs. Weston is quite surprised by the news, but happy for them. The news spreads quickly, and everyone has their opinion about it, although most are happy for them. The exception is Mrs. Elton, who feels sorry for Mr. Knightley and regrets that there will be no more pleasant interaction with him", "analysis": ""}
