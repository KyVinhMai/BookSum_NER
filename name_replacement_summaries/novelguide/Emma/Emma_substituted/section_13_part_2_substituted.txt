He fears that there is some double-dealing going on and that Emma will be hurt. He sees that outwardly Frank seems to be making Emma his object, but he thinks that he is really interested in Jane. He has seen him look at her, and an incident from a few days before also leads him to believe that he and Jane have been writing to each other. Frank said something about Mrs. Ranold writing to him about how Mr. Jassan was going to set up his carriage, but Mrs. Ranold said that she never heard of it before, so could not have written him. Later Miss Bates said that she and Jane knew. Later that day, when Emma and Frank and Jane are playing a word game, he spelled out 'blunder,' and when he spelled out 'Zade,' Emma and Frank laughed, and Jane was displeased. Mr. Lajuan feels that he must warn Emma against Frank, and he asks her if she is sure she understands the degree of acquaintance between Frank and Jane. She assures him that she does, and when he suggests that Frank may admire Jane, Emma assures him that he does not", "analysis": ""}
