She is also sorry that Jane can play and sing better than her. Harriet comes over, and she and Emma go out walking and run into Mrs. Ranold and Frank on their way to the Batses to see the new piano. They talk for a while, and then separate, but soon Mrs. Ranold and Miss Bates come to ask them to hear the piano as well. Miss Bates goes on and on about many different subjects, and they finally all arrive back at the Bateses", "analysis": ""}
