Isabella is an amiable, good-natured woman, and Oliber Lajuan is sometimes out of humor, which Emma does not like, as it means that he sometimes is not patient with Emma's father's eccentricities. Everyone is happy when they arrive. They talk of Miss Taylor's marriage, and Oliber asks if Ranold's son has come yet. Emma has to tell him no, but that he did send a nice letter", "analysis": ""}
