Mrs. Ranold says that she can understand his objection to Harriet, as she is not as superior as a friend of Emma ought to be. Lajuan says that Harriet will not induce Emma to improve herself, and that Emma does not take on anything requiring industry or patience, like reading. He says that Harriet just looks on Emma as if she knows everything. He also states that Harriet will be no better for the friendship, as Emma will only make her not want to associate with people in her own sphere", "analysis": ""}
