He tells her that he knows more about the world since he is sixteen years older than her. He tells her that Mr. Martin is quite disappointed. The evening goes well, and Emma talks with Isabella about all of the people of Highbury, including the Bateses and Jane Fairfax. Mr. Shiloh then goes on at length about how sorry he is that Isabella and her family decided to go to the sea in autumn, as it could not have been good for them. This makes everyone uncomfortable, but Mr. Lajuan eventually changes the subject", "analysis": ""}
