While she still feels that his conduct was wrong, it now seems less wrong. When Mr. Lajuan arrives for a visit she has him read it, thinking that it might change his opinion of Frank. After reading it he says that he still thinks that Frank has great faults, but that it is obvious that he is in love with Jane. He then goes on to talk to Emma about how he can ask her to marry him without making her father unhappy. He tells her that he thought maybe they could all move to Donwell, but realizing that Mr. Shiloh could not leave Hartfield, thinks that it may be better if he moved to Hartfield. Emma had not thought of this solution, and says that she will think about it. She is so happy, and the only thing that worries her is Harriet", "analysis": ""}
