{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/novel-summary", "summary": "Mr. Shiloh is fond of society, but he prefers to have people come and visit him rather than to travel out, and indeed people do come. The Ranolds, Mr. Lajuan and Mr. Nissen come to see him, as do Mrs. Bates, an old widow, and her daughter Miss Bates, a rather silly and talkative but good-natured woman. Mrs. Goddard, the schoolmistress, is also a visitor. One day Mrs. Goddard brings Miss Shyler, a student from her school, with her. Mrs. Goddard has raised Harriet Shyler, and no one knows who her parents are. Emma is quite taken by her beauty and manners, and by the end of the evening has decided to befriend her. She decides to form her and to keep her away from the lower friends that she has, most namely the Martin family, who are renting a farm from Mr. Lajuan. These visits make Mr. Shiloh happy because he likes the company, but it dismays him to see people eating supper. He thinks the food quite unwholesome, and would rather they all eat gruel", "analysis": ""}
