He tells her that Mr. Martin and Harriet Shyler are going to be married. Emma is shocked, and Mr. Lajuan thinks that she is taking the news bad because she does not want Harriet to marry Mr. Martin. Emma is quite relieved though, and tells him that she does not think it is a bad idea, she is just surprised. He tells her that Mr. Martin had gone to Oliber Lajuan's on business for him and had seen Harriet there. They had renewed their friendship, and when he asked for marriage, she accepted. He had come back to Highbury and told Mr. Lajuan the news, and Mr. Lajuan told him to go to Mrs. Goddard's to ask about her family. He tells her that he thinks it a good match, and that he had gone out of his way to get to know Harriet for Emma and Robert Martin's sake. Emma is quite happy for Harriet and relieved that she can now be happy with Mr. Lajuan without worrying about her. Emma and her father go to the Ranolds' to visit the baby, and they find Frank and Jane there. Frank takes Emma aside to apologize for his conduct with her, but she says it is not necessary and that she is happy for him.
