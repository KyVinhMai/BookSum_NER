Emma thinks again how she could not leave her father, and decides that even if Mr. Lajuan were to ask her to marry him, she would have to refuse. She decides to watch Mr. Lajuan, as he is to return that day, to see where his affections lie. She writes a letter to Harriet saying that she thinks it best if they do not see each other for a few days, and Harriet agrees. Mrs. Ranold stops by on her way home after a visit to Jane Fairfax. She and Mr. Ranold had gone there to show that they approve of the match and to get to know her better. While there, Jane asked Mrs. Ranold to thank Emma for her attentions during her illness, and Emma is reminded of all of her injustices to Jane. The evening wears on, and Emma worries about how everyone is leaving her. If Mr. Lajuan married, he would not visit as much, and since Mrs. Ranold was to soon have a child, she would be too busy for Emma. She also worries about her past conduct, and the only thing that makes her feel better is the resolution that she will behave better", "analysis": ""}
