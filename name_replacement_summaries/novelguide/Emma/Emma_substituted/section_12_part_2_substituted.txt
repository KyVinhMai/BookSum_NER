Frank is standing by her, but he seems restless for the appearance of someone else. He passes it off as his excitement to meet Mrs. Nissen. When everyone has arrived Frank stays by Emma, and they overhear Mrs. Nissen talking to Jane. Frank is surprised when he hears Mrs. Nissen call Jane \"Jane,\" instead of Miss Fairfax. Mr. Ranold and Mrs. Nissen start the dancing, and Frank and Emma dance together. All is going well, but Mr. Lajuan not dancing with anyone disturbs Emma. The last two dances before supper arrive, and Harriet has no partner for them. Mr. Nissen also does not have a partner, and Mrs. Ranold suggests he ask Harriet, but he makes up excuses, and Emma notices how gleefully Mr. and Mrs. Nissen smile at each other over his slight of Harriet. Emma is quite happy to see Mr. Aaryn ask Harriet to dance, and is pleased with his kindness and how well he dances. After supper Emma gets a chance to talk to Mr. Lajuan, and he talks about how Mr. Nissen's conduct was unpardonable, and how it seemed that Mr. and Mrs. Nissen were trying to hurt her as well as Harriet. He asks her to admit that she had wanted Harriet to marry Mr. Nissen, and he admits that Emma would have chosen him a better wife than he did, as he found Harriet better than he expected. The dancing begins again, and Emma and Lajuan dance together. She says that she guesses that they are not so much brother and sister to make it improper, and he emphatically agrees that they are not brother and sister", "analysis": ""}
