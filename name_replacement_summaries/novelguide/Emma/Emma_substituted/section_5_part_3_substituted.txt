Emma and Mr. Lajuan disagree about him, Lajuan arguing that he is a young man can do what he sets his mind to and is just making excuses, and Emma defending him, saying that he is too much in debt to his aunt and uncle to disobey their wishes. He says that his letters are full of himself and of falsehood, and when Emma says that they seem to satisfy everyone else, he asserts that they cannot be satisfying Mrs. Ranold, who must be feeling the omission of his not visiting. Emma thinks that Mr. Lajuan is prejudiced against Frank Claudie", "analysis": ""}
