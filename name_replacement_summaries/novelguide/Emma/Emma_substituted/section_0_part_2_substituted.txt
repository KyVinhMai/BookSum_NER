He met and married Miss Claudie over the objections of her brother, and she died three years later after bearing them a son, Frank. Ranold eventually gave Frank up to his wife's brother and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Claudie, to raise, as they had more money and could support him better, and Frank eventually even took the name Claudie. Mr. Ranold purchased a small estate in Highbury. He sees his son every year in London, and everyone in Highbury thinks Frank Claudie is one of their own, and all talk about him with pride even though they have never met him. Now with the marriage of Mr. Ranold and Miss Taylor, everyone thinks that he will have to come and visit soon to meet the new Mrs. Ranold. Instead Mrs. Ranold gets a very nice letter from him that everyone in Highbury approves of and cannot talk about enough", "analysis": ""}
