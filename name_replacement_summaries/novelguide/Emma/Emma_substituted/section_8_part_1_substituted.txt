Mr. Ranold tries to laugh it off, but Mrs. Ranold seems not to like it, evident in her trying to change the subject. This frivolous act is the only reason Emma has to question the good nature of Frank, though. Emma is sure that Frank is close to loving her, if he is not in love with her already, and she thinks that all of their acquaintances have them marked out for each other. Mr. Lajuan however, is an exception. He does not share the good opinion of Frank Claudie that the rest of Highbury has, and thinks him a silly fellow. The Nyaire of Highbury are of low origin, but have built their fortune so that they are second only to the Shilohs now in Highbury. They have taken to having dinner-parties, and Emma had decided that if she were invited, she would not attend, to show them that she did not approve of them trying to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them. It turns out that everyone is invited to a party at the Nyaire except the Shilohs, and Emma is hurt. The invitation does finally arrive though, and Emma decides to accept it after all", "analysis": ""}
