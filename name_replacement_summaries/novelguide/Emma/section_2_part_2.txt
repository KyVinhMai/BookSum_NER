Mr. Knightley hints that Harriet may soon be receiving a marriage proposal. Emma thinks that Mr. Elton has dropped a hint, but Mr. Knightley says that Robert Martin had paid him a visit to ask him what he thought about it. Knightley says that he is an excellent young man, and that he encouraged him in his proposal. Emma tells Knightley that Martin has already proposed, and that Harriet has refused him. Knightley is quite surprised and says that she must be mistaken. When Emma says that she saw her refusal, Knightley accuses her of writing it. He is shocked when he finds out that Emma thinks Martin is not Harriet's equal, stating that he is her superior. He tells Emma that she has been no friend to Harriet, and that Harriet should marry Martin, as no higher man would marry a woman with such an obscure family history. Knightley guesses that Emma is trying to make a match between Harriet and Mr. Elton, and he tells her that it will be in vain, as Elton is a very respectable vicar and would not make such an imprudent match. After Knightley takes leave of Emma she is concerned, as she usually respects Knightley's opinion, but she convinces herself that he has never seen Elton and Harriet together, so she knows better than he does", "analysis": ""}
