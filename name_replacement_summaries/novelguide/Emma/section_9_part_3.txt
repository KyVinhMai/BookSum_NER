Soon the joy is over though, when Frank gets a letter from Mr. Churchill urging him to come home, as Mrs. Churchill is ill. Although he does not feel any real alarm over his aunt's illness, Frank must go. He stops by quickly to say goodbye to Emma, having already stopped off at the Bateses. He seems to be trying to tell Emma something serious, but she does not encourage it, thinking that she does not want to hear it. He says that she must be suspicious as to what he wants to say, and when he leaves, she thinks that he is more in love with her than she had thought. She thinks that she must be in love with him too, and that it would be quite odd if she were not. When Emma next sees Jane, she is irritated to see that Jane seems indifferent to the loss of the ball, but she blames some of Jane's indifference to the fact that she has been ill", "analysis": ""}
