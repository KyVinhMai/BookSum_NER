On the way, Harriet wonders why Emma is not married, and she replies that she does not intend to marry, and that she is happy at Hartfield. They then talk of Miss Bates, who is an old maid, and of how she can do almost nothing but talk of her niece, Jane Fairfax. On their way back from the cottage they run into Mr. Elton, and he continues on their walk with them. Emma tries to get he and Harriet alone together by trying to fall behind and pretending to fix her shoe. She then says that her lace is broken so that they are invited into Elton's house, but all her efforts are for nothing, as Elton does not take advantage of his time alone with Harriet to talk to her of anything serious", "analysis": ""}
