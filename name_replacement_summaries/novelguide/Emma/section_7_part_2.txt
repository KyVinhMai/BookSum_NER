Harriet reports that she had seen only Mrs. Martin and her two daughters, and that they had been cool to her at first. They were all falling back into the friendship they used to have when Harriet was summoned to go. Emma wishes that the Martins were just a little higher in status so that she could allow Harriet to marry Mr. Martin, but she cannot regret her decision. On their way back to Hartfield they stop at Randalls to visit the Westons and learn that they had had a letter from Frank saying that he would be there the next day. Mrs. Weston is nervous about meeting Frank Churchill, and Emma is thinking of her the next day when she walks into the parlour and sees Mr. Weston and his son with her father.
