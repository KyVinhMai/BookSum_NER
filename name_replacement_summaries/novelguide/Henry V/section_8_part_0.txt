He urges his foot soldiers and archers to show their mettle, to demonstrate that they are worthy of their upbringing. He does not doubt that they are, and he sees nobility in their eyes. As he leads this latest assault, he encourages them to yell patriotic slogans as they scale the walls of the city.   .", "analysis": ".
