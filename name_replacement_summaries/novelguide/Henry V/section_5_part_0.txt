{"name": "Act 2, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022042257/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-v/summaries/act2-scen3", "summary": "Hostess, Pistol, Nym, Bardolph and the Boy enter. Pistol mourns the death of Falstaff, while Bardolph wishes he was with him, in heaven or hell. Hostess claims that Falstaff is in \"Arthur's bosom\"; she really means Abraham's bosom. She describes his peaceful death. On his deathbed he cried out against wine, and said that women were devils incarnate. After a few fond reminiscences about Falstaff's life, the men bid farewell to the Hostess, for they must be off to France.", "analysis": ". The death of Falstaff symbolizes the death of the spirit of frivolity in Henry V. Pistol once again brings attention to the seamy side of war, in his declaration that in France they will be like horseleeches, sucking blood."}
