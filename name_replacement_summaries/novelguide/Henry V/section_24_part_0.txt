London's citizens line the streets to greet him like a conquering Caesar. The Chorus apologizes for abbreviating the historical story. He makes no mention of the further English invasions that took place after Agincourt, from 1416 to 1419, and the play now jumps forward to the Treaty of Troyes, which was signed by England and France in 1420.", "analysis": ""}
