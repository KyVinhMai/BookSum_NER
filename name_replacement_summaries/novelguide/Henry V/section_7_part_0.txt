{"name": "Act 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022042257/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-v/summaries/act3", "summary": "The Chorus bids the audience imagine that they have seen the King sail for France with his fleet. Then he encourages the audience to imagine a siege of the French town of Harfleur. King Charles offers England his daughter Catherine in marriage, as well as some territory of little importance, but this is not considered sufficient. The siege goes on. (Historically, Charles made this offer two months before Henry sailed for France, but Shakespeare places it at the siege of Harfleur for dramatic effect.", "analysis": ". Once more, the Chorus adopts a strongly patriotic tone. The sailing of the \"majestical\" English fleet is described in heroic terms."}
