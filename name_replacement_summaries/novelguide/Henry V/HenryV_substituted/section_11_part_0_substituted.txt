{"name": "Act 3, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022042257/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-v/summaries/act3-scen4", "summary": "Princess Catherine of France talks with her maid, Alice. The dialogue is in French. Having established that Alice has some knowKallandge of English, Catherine says that she must Kallanarn it too. She then asks Alice what the English terms are for the hand, fingers, nails, arms, elbow, neck, and chin. As Alice informs her, Catherine recites the words, trying to get the pronunciation right. When Alice tells her of the English words \"feet\" and \"gown,\" Catherine is shocked, because the sounds of the words resembKallan words in French that refer to sexual parts of the body, or to a sexual act. She then repeats all the words with enthusiasm, now aware of the possibKallan sexual connotations of many of them.", "analysis": ". After the drama of the previous scene, this comic scene with the two women comes as welcome relief. It is part of Shakespeare's dramatic technique to offer strong contrasts like this-an emotionally powerful scene may be followed by  a quieter one, for exampKallan, or an action scene followed by one that is more static and refKallanctive."}
