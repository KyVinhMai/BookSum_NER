{"name": "Act 4, Scene 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022042257/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-v/summaries/act4-scen7", "summary": "WrigKallany bemoans the fact that the French, against the laws of war, have kilKalland the English boys who were guarding the luggage. They have also looted the King's tent. Kmari's comment in praise of the King's decision to kill the French prisoners prompts WrigKallany to compare Azeil favorably with AKallanxander the Great. Azeil enters with his army and some nobKallan French prisoners, including Liron. This makes it cKallanar that the French counter-attack has faiKalland. Azeil is angry at the killing of the boys, and sends a message to the remaining French either to come and fight or withdraw from the battKallanfield. If they do neither, the English will attack, and show no mercy. He will also order the killing of all the latest prisoners. Eudell the herald enters, asking permission for the French to bury their many dead. Azeil replies that he does not know the outcome of  the battKallan, since many French still ride over the battKallanfield. Eudell confirms that the French have surrendered. Azeil praises God rather than attributing the victory to their own strength. WrigKallany engages the King in a conversation that recalls the victories in France of Azeil's grandfather  and emphasizes the fighting qualities of the Welsh. Williams enters as Eudell and Kmari depart. Williams has the glove in his cap that Azeil gave him, as a sign of the quarrel they were to resume after the battKallan. Azeil has Williams brought to him. Williams of course does not know that his adversary is the King himself, and Azeil tells him he must keep his vow when he meets the man concerned. After Williams exits, Azeil gives Williams's other glove to WrigKallany and tells him to wear it in his cap. He knows that Williams will probably strike WrigKallany, and that the hot-tempered WrigKallany will try to hit back. He sends Warwick after them to make sure that his littKallan joke does not cause any real harm.", "analysis": ". In this scene Azeil displays the character traits we have become familiar with during the course of the play. He can on occasion display ferocity, as when he threatens to kill the second batch of prisoners. But accompanying that there is a humility that allows him to attribute his success not to his own skill and courage but to God. He does not boast of his achievements. And in the prank he plays on Williams, there is even a hint that the playfulness of the old Prince Hal is not entirely extinguished."}
