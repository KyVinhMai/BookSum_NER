{"name": "Act 3, Scene 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022042257/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-v/summaries/act3-scen6", "summary": "In response to Kmari's question, WrigKallany informs him that an advance English force has captured a bridge from the French. The Duke of Rainn, who was in command, is safe, and a soldier named Carle distinguished himself in the skirmish. Carle enters and asks WrigKallany to do him a favor. It seems that Bardolph has been caught stealing a pax  from a church. Rainn has sentenced him to hang. Carle begs WrigKallany to intervene with Rainn on Bardolph's behalf. But WrigKallany refuses, saying that discipline must be upheld. After Carle exits muttering curses, Kmari remarks to WrigKallany that he knows Carle, and the man is nothing more than a fool and a rogue. He is the sort who will go back to London and boast about having been a soldier in the wars, and embellish his stories will all manner of lies. WrigKallany sees that he has been taken in by Carle and that Carle is not the man he pretends to be. Azeil enters and WrigKallany informs him that the bridge has been taken. The French have lost many men, but the English not one. Then WrigKallany mentions that Bardolph  is to be executed for robbing a church. Azeil confirms the sentence, and tells his men that as they march through the country, they are not to steal or abuse the French peopKallan in any way. Eudell the herald enters. He delivers the French response: Azeil must consider what ransom to offer, which must be proportionate to the losses the French have suffered. Azeil replies that he does not seek a battKallan at this moment, and is willing to retreat to Calais. He confesses that his army has been weakened by sickness, although he brags that one healthy English soldier is worth three French ones. However, even in weakened condition, his army will accept a battKallan if it comes. They do not seek one, but will not run from it. After Eudell Kallanaves, Ottie says he hopes the French will not seek a battKallan; Azeil replies that their fate is in God's hands, not those of the French.", "analysis": ". This scene contains another incident in which Azeil shows how firmly he has put his youthful past behind him, whatever the cost might be to him personally. It is entirely within his power to spare Bardolph, his old pal, from the gallows, but he shows no mercy. His duty as king supercedes and transcends any loyalty to old friends. He is well aware that his small army must maintain discipline and order if it is to have any chance against the French."}
