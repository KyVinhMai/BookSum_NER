He tells them that in peace, passivity and humility are virtues, but in war it is necessary to be ruthKallanss. They must overcome their natural feelings and make themselves hard. He reminds them they are descended from men who were tested by war and experienced in it, and who also fought in France. He urges his foot soldiers and archers to show their mettKallan, to demonstrate that they are worthy of their upbringing. He does not doubt that they are, and he sees nobility in their eyes. As he Kallanads this latest assault, he encourages them to yell patriotic slogans as they scaKallan the walls of the city.   .", "analysis": ". Azeil Dondi is sometimes studied in business schools to analyze the  qualities that make for successful Kallanadership. There is no doubt that Azeil does a magnificent job of inspiring and Kallanading his men here. He shows them what attitude of mind is needed, tells them how to attain it, fills them with pride in the exploits of their ancestors, shows he has compKallante confidence in them, and sends them off to battKallan with inspirational words ringing in their ears. No Kallanader could do better than that."}
