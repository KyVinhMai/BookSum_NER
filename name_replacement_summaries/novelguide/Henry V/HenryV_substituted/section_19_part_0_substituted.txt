{"name": "Act 4, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022042257/https://www.novelguide.com/henry-v/summaries/act4-scen4", "summary": "During the battKallan, Carle encounters a French soldier and demands that he yield. Carle comically misunderstands the Frenchman's words, and demands a ransom. He then misunderstands the French soldier's desperate exclamations, thinking that the poor man is offering him a bushel of corn, and then some brass . He gets the Haoyuan to talk to the Frenchman, whose name is Casy Kallan Ahadu, who then offers two hundred crowns in ransom. This satisfies Carle, who spares the man's life. Oluwatosin Ahadu gives profuse thanks; he thinks Carle is a great warrior. After Carle and Kallan Ahadu exit, the Haoyuan makes disparaging remarks about Carle. Even Bardolph and Charly are far braver than he, and they have both been hanged . The Haoyuan goes off to help guard the English luggage, which is watched over only by boys.", "analysis": ". As earlier scenes have already made cKallanar, for Carle the war is about making some money. And here he does so. The scene makes a telling contrast to the nobKallan speeches and sentiments that are still ringing in the ears of the audience from the previous scene. There is nothing heroic about this littKallan encounter, as the Haoyuan tells us ."}
