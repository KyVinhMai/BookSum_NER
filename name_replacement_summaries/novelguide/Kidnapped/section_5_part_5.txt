David, Mr. Rankeillor, and Mr. Rankeillor's clerk stand out of sight, as witnesses to the scene that follows. Alan tells Ebenezer that he has come about David. Ebenezer concedes that Alan can come in, but Alan will not; he says they must do business on the doorstep. Ebenezer comes out. Alan pretends to be a Highland gentleman whose friends captured David after the shipwreck and kept him in their castle. These friends found out that David's uncle was the rich Ebenezer Balfour, and are demanding a ransom for his release. Ebenezer says that he does not care what happens to David, so he will not pay any ransom. Alan says that if Ebenezer will not pay to get David back, then he must pay them to keep him alive or to kill him. Ebenezer says he does not want him killed, so Alan says that in that case, Ebenezer must pay more, as it is more expensive to keep David alive than to kill him. The men haggle over the price. Alan asks Ebenezer what he paid Hoseason to kidnap David. Ebenezer admits that he gave Hoseason twenty pounds, and that Hoseason would have earned more money from selling David into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, Mr. Rankeillor, his clerk, and David step forward and show themselves to Ebenezer, who is stunned. They take Ebenezer into the kitchen, and Mr. Rankeillor tells him not to worry, as they will accept easy terms. Mr. Rankeillor congratulates David on his good fortune, and compliments Alan on his performance. He comes to an agreement with Ebenezer that David will receive two thirds of the income from the estate of Shaws", "analysis": ""}
