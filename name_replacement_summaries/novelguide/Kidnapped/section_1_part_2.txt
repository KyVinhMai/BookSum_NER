When he asks passers-by for directions, he finds that they are wary of the place and of Ebenezer, and warn him against going there. Near sundown, David asks a woman for further directions. She points out a ruined house in the next valley. David's heart sinks, as he was expecting to find wealthy relatives. The woman bitterly curses the house of Shaws and its laird , Ebenezer. David trembles with shock, but approaches the house, which on closer inspection proves to be in a run-down condition, with one wing unfinished. David knocks at the door. After some time, a man appears at an upstairs window, pointing a blunderbuss at David. David tells the man that he has a letter for Ebenezer Balfour. The man tells him to put the letter on the step and leave, but David insists that he must deliver it into Ebenezer's hands. David reveals his name, and the man starts in surprise. The man speculates that David has come because his father is dead. David wonders how he knows this. The man reluctantly says he will let David in", "analysis": ""}
