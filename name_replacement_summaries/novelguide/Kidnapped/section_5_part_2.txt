He is eager to visit Mr. Rankeillor and claim his inheritance. They reach a bridge, but a sentry is there, so they avoid crossing it and strike out across country. They need to cross the Firth of Forth, the estuary of the River Forth. They reach Limekilns and go into an inn, where the innkeeper's daughter brings them food. David pretends to be ill, and Alan pretends to be impoverished gentry. Alan tells the woman that he cannot safely say why they are in trouble, but whistles a Jacobite tune to give her a clue. The woman feels sorry for them, but David sees that she is frightened of helping Jacobites. He mentions that he is trying to cross the Firth to visit Mr. Rankeillor, and that King George has no greater friend in Scotland than himself. She respects Rankeillor, and her fears are allayed. She steals a boat and rows David and Alan across the Firth herself. David hopes that they have not exposed her to danger", "analysis": ""}
