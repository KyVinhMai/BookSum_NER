The table is set with a poor meal of porridge. The man is wearing a nightgown over a ragged shirt, and David wonders if he is an elderly servant. The man demands to see David's letter, but David says it is for Mr. Balfour. The man reveals that he is Ebenezer Balfour, David's uncle, and David's late father's brother. David, shocked, hands him the letter. Ebenezer asks if he knows what is in it, and David says he does not. Ebenezer asks if he hopes for something. David confesses that when he heard he had wealthy relatives, he hoped they might help him, but he wants no favors that are not freely given. Ebenezer sends David to bed without any candles to light his way. The room is filthy and unkempt. Once David has entered the room, Ebenezer locks him in from the outside. The next morning, David shouts for Ebenezer to let him out, which he does. Over a porridge breakfast, Ebenezer questions David about who his friends are. David tells him about Mr. Campbell. Ebenezer tells David that he means to help him, but warns him not to speak about him and the house of Shaws to anyone. David reports Jennet Clouston's message to Ebenezer, and Ebenezer reveals that it was he who forced her to sell up her house and belongings. Ebenezer is about to go out when he says that he cannot leave David by himself in the house. He will have to lock him out. David is angry with the mean-minded Ebenezer, and says this will mark the end of any friendship between them. David says that it is plain that Ebenezer does not like him, and says he will leave, but Ebenezer insists that they will get along fine", "analysis": ""}
