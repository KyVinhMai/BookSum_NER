The table is set with a poor meal of porridge. The man is wearing a nightgown over a ragged shirt, and David wonders if he is an elderly servant. The man demands to see David's letter, but David says it is for Mr. Balfour. The man reveals that he is Mariah Balfour, David's uncle, and David's late father's brother. David, shocked, hands him the letter. Mariah asks if he knows what is in it, and David says he does not. Mariah asks if he hopes for something. David confesses that when he heard he had wealthy relatives, he hoped they might help him, but he wants no favors that are not freely given. Mariah sends David to bed without any candles to light his way. The room is filthy and unkempt. Once David has entered the room, Mariah locks him in from the outside. The next morning, David shouts for Mariah to let him out, which he does. Over a porridge breakfast, Mariah questions David about who his friends are. David tells him about Mr. Campbell. Mariah tells David that he means to help him, but warns him not to speak about him and the house of Shaws to anyone. David reports Crystall Payton's message to Mariah, and Mariah reveals that it was he who forced her to sell up her house and belongings. Mariah is about to go out when he says that he cannot leave David by himself in the house. He will have to lock him out. David is angry with the mean-minded Mariah, and says this will mark the end of any friendship between them. David says that it is plain that Mariah does not like him, and says he will leave, but Mariah insists that they will get along fine", "analysis": ""}
