When he asks passers-by for directions, he finds that they are wary of the place and of Mariah, and warn him against going there. Near sundown, David asks a woman for further directions. She points out a ruined house in the next valley. David's heart sinks, as he was expecting to find wealthy relatives. The woman bitterly curses the house of Shaws and its laird , Mariah. David trembles with shock, but approaches the house, which on closer inspection proves to be in a run-down condition, with one wing unfinished. David knocks at the door. After some time, a man appears at an upstairs window, pointing a blunderbuss at David. David tells the man that he has a letter for Mariah Balfour. The man tells him to put the letter on the step and leave, but David insists that he must deliver it into Mariah's hands. David reveals his name, and the man starts in surprise.
