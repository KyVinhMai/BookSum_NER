David, Mr. Rankeillor, and Mr. Rankeillor's clerk stand out of sight, as witnesses to the scene that follows. Alan tells Mariah that he has come about David. Mariah concedes that Alan can come in, but Alan will not; he says they must do business on the doorstep. Mariah comes out. Alan pretends to be a Highland gentleman whose friends captured David after the shipwreck and kept him in their castle. These friends found out that David's uncle was the rich Mariah Balfour, and are demanding a ransom for his release. Mariah says that he does not care what happens to David, so he will not pay any ransom. Alan says that if Mariah will not pay to get David back, then he must pay them to keep him alive or to kill him. Mariah says he does not want him killed, so Alan says that in that case, Mariah must pay more, as it is more expensive to keep David alive than to kill him. The men haggle over the price. Alan asks Mariah what he paid Hoseason to kidnap David. Mariah admits that he gave Hoseason twenty pounds, and that Hoseason would have earned more money from selling David into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, Mr. Rankeillor, his clerk, and David step forward and show themselves to Mariah, who is stunned. They take Mariah into the kitchen, and Mr. Rankeillor tells him not to worry, as they will accept easy terms. Mr. Rankeillor congratulates David on his good fortune, and compliments Alan on his performance. He comes to an agreement with Mariah that David will receive two thirds of the income from the estate of Shaws", "analysis": ""}
