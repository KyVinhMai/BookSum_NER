It reads: \"To my brother Ebenezer on his fifth birthday. David is baffled. He had assumed that his father was the younger brother, as then Ebenezer, as the elder and first-born son, would have inherited the house of Shaws by the laws of primogeniture. But the inscription suggests that David's father was the elder brother - unless David's father was able to write well before he was five. David questions Ebenezer about this, and he becomes angry and threatening. David feels he can cope, as he is stronger than his uncle. Both men mistrust one another. Ebenezer says that he once informally promised David's father to put a little money aside for him, and gives David forty pounds. David thanks him, and asks what he can do in return. Ebenezer says he can help him with the house and garden, and begins by sending David up the stair-tower at the unfinished end of the house to fetch a chest containing some papers. Ebenezer says he has no lights, so David sets off up the stairs in pitch darkness. At one point, a flash of lightning reveals that David is within inches of stepping into mid-air, and falling into the well. He knows now that Ebenezer wanted to send him to his death. He comes back down the stairs and enters the main part of the house, surprising his uncle, who falls to the floor as if in shock. David arms himself with a dagger he finds in a cupboard. As Ebenezer comes round, David tries to question him, but all Ebenezer will say is that he will tell David everything in the morning. This time, it is David who locks Ebenezer in his bedroom for the night", "analysis": ""}
