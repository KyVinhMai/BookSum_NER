Moments later, members of the crew attack the round-house, and the battle begins. Alan kills two men with his sword, including Shuan, and David grazes Hoseason with a bullet. The attackers briefly retreat before renewing their attack. Though David is very afraid, he manages to shoot two men who try to enter through the skylight. Alan kills several more men; others run off into the forecastle. Alan and David are victorious. Alan, filled with ecstasy from the fight, embraces David as a brother. He makes up a song about the battle in Gaelic, which does not mention David's part in the fight at all. Overcome with emotion at having shot two men, David bursts into tears. Alan says that David should sleep. They arrange to take turns in keeping watch for further attacks", "analysis": ""}
