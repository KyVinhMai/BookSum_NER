{"name": "Chapter VIII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210511071637/https://www.novelguide.com/kidnapped/summaries/chapter7-12", "summary": "One night, Shuan kills Ransome. Ransome's body is carried into the forecastle. Hoseason orders David to be the new cabin boy, and sends David to the round-house, the officers' quarters, where he will work and sleep. The round-house is where the best food and drink, and the firearms, gunpowder and cutlasses are stored. David and Hoseason enter the round-house, where Shuan is sitting with a bottle in front of him, looking stunned. Riach enters and confirms that Ransome is dead. Shuan goes to drink from his bottle, but Riach snatches the bottle from him and throws it overboard. Shuan tries to attack Riach, but Hoseason intervenes and tells Shuan that he has murdered the boy. Shuan excuses himself by saying that Ransome brought him a dirty cup. Hoseason tells Riach that the truth must never emerge back on land about how Ransome died: they must all say that he fell overboard. David quickly gets used to his duties, which are not too hard. Hoseason and Riach treat him well, and David thinks this is out of guilt that they treated Ransome harshly. Shuan seems to lose his sanity altogether after the murder. David tries to talk to Hoseason and Riach about his own situation, but neither will listen", "analysis": ""}
