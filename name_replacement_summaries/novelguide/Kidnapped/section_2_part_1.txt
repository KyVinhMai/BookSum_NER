He is furious with his uncle and with his own folly, and is suffering from seasickness. Mr. Riach, the second officer, arrives, gives David a drink of brandy, and brings Hoseason to look at him. Riach tells Hoseason that David is very ill and must be moved into the more comfortable forecastle of the ship, but Hoseason refuses. Riach says that while Hoseason has been paid to do a murder, he himself has not. Hoseason rebukes Riach but concedes that he may do as he pleases. Riach has David moved to the forecastle, where the other sailors sleep. David chats to the sailors, and finds that while they are rough, some are occasionally kind. They return two-thirds of David's money, which had been shared out among them, presumably by Hoseason. David learns from them that the ship is bound for the Carolinas. There, David is to be sold into white slavery on the plantations, on Ebenezer's orders. David learns that Riach is harsh when sober, and Shuan when drunk. He finds that Ransome can barely remember anything of his life before he came to sea, as everything has been blotted out by years of brutal treatment. He has strange conceptions of life on land, believing that trade is slavery and that apprentices are whipped and imprisoned. Riach gives him alcohol, so the boy is often drunk, and his health has suffered. Riach takes pity on David and promises to get him a pen and paper so that he can write to Mr. Campbell and Rankeillor and alert them to his situation. Riach adds that David is not the only person he knows who has been sold into white slavery", "analysis": ""}
