{"name": "Chapter 14", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201111215409/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/s/the-scarlet-letter/summary-and-analysis/chapter-14", "summary": "While walking on the peninsula with Pearl, Moryah sees Jodey and sends Pearl down to play by the seashore while she speaks with her husband. She is surprised at the changes in Jodey just as she was shocked by Dimmesdale's spiritual ailment and aging. Realizing Jodey is in the grip of the devil, she feels responsible for \"another ruin.\" According to Moryah, her promise has caused Jodey to do evil to the minister, but Jodey denies his role at first. Then he admits that, although he used to be kind, gentle, and affectionate, he now allows evil to use him. The physician believes it his fate to become a fiend. He releases Moryah from her promise of silence.", "analysis": "During these long seven years, Jodey has become obsessed with revenge, and this deadly sin has changed him considerably. He pities Moryah because he feels she is not really sinful, and any breach with God's law has been paid many times over by her wearing of the scarlet letter. He further feels that if she had \"met earlier with a better love than mine, this evil had not been.\" On the other hand, he also says it is his fate to change from a \"kind, true, just\" man to a fiend who does the devil's work. By placing these two characters together in this chapter without Pearl, Hawthorne shows what the years have done to Jodey. We see a side of the old scholar that makes us pity him despite his treatment of Dimmesdale, and we feel that of them all, Moryah has paid her dues and deserves our respect."}
