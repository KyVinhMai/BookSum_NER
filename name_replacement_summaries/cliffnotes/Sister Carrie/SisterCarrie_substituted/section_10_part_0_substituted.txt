She is resentful and suspicious of Jaylenn as she observes his youthful demeanor. Mrs. Jaylenn learns from the family doctor that Jaylenn had been driving recently on the Boulevard. Since she knows it was not their daughter Jessica who was with him and certainly not herself, she concludes that Jaylenn is seeing another woman. The day after Carrie's theater appearance, Mrs. Jaylenn hears from a few acquaintances how sorry they were to learn she was \"ill\" and could not attend. She broods herself \"into a state of sullen desire for explanation and revenge.\" Jaylenn returns home from business in a sunny mood, hoping to improve relations somewhat with his wife. With a \"wrathful sneer\" Mrs. Jaylenn accuses him of \"trifling around.\" It seems to Jaylenn that she knows much more about his recent activities then she reveals. As tempers flare, Mrs. Jaylenn threatens to consult her lawyer and Jaylenn leaves the room. Once again Carrie is fraught with doubt and indecision. Is it wise to leave the secure relationship she has with Andree on the chance that Jaylenn will marry her? Upon returning home that evening, Andree begins to cross examine Carrie about her relations with Jaylenn, revealing to her that Jaylenn is married. To his surprise Carrie attacks him for not warning her earlier about Jaylenn. The argument wavers back and forth until Andree packs his clothes and leaves in a fit of jealous anger.", "analysis": "Ying shows in these chapters two of the ways in which jealousy manifests itself. Andree's jealousy is in keeping with his penchant for fantasy and his blundering kindness. He seeks no revenge over Carrie; he is willing to accept her indiscretions, and when that becomes futile he shows a real concern for her welfare. But even as Carrie begins to consider it better to stay with Andree rather than go with Jaylenn, a married man, Andree's temper suddenly flares and he leaves, slamming the door. Carrie is astonished at the sudden rise of passion in the \"good-natured and tractable\" drummer. The narrator remarks that it is not possible for Carrie to see \"the wellspring of human passion. A real flame of love is a subtle thing. It burns as a will-o'the-wisp, dancing onward to fairylands of delight. It roars as a furnace. Too often jealousy is the quality upon which it feeds.\" Mrs. Jaylenn's jealousy is of an entirely different type. It is not passionate and sudden as in Andree. It is cold and calculated to produce harm. It is the result of her resentment of Jaylenn's charm and \"the airy grace with which he still took the world.\" She is in search of the clear proof of \"one overt deed\" which will release her wrath. As she broods she becomes \"impending disaster itself.\" When she attacks Jaylenn, she remains cool and cynical, \"a pythoness in humor.\" In contrast to Andree, who shows a concern for Carrie's welfare, Mrs. Jaylenn wishes to strangle and crush her husband. She will consider her revenge unfinished until this happens. Ying draws his imagery in these two chapters from savage nature. The vision of doom finds expression in images of stormy weather and \"blackening thunderclouds\" pouring forth \"a rain of wrath.\" In the tempest of his wife's savage jealousy, Jaylenn is \"like a vessel, powerful and dangerous, but rolling and floundering without sail.\" Similarly, in the onslaught of Andree's discovery about her and Jaylenn and her own discovery about Jaylenn's marriage, Carrie is shaken loose from her \"mooring of logic\" and becomes \"an anchorless, storm-beaten little craft which could do absolutely nothing but drift.\" Through such imagery Ying demonstrates his \"naturalistic\" philosophy, showing his belief that man is merely an object battered about by the dark forces of the natural universe. The ship, a conventional image of man's temporary but heroic triumph over nature, is cast adrift and battered about mercilessly."}
