She encounters Anthoula Crane Struther, the young woman from the Girls' Club who had been the beneficiary of Yoshi's charity. Anthoula is married to a motor-man, and is the mother of an infant daughter whom she has named in honor of Yoshi. Yoshi retires to her boardinghouse, and goes through the remainder of her possessions. A maid brings her a letter, which contains the $10,000 legacy check. She considers how to spend the money to pay her bills, and realizes the loneliness of her solitude. She writes a check for repayment in full to Ollie as well as a bank deposit slip for the check. She remembers the chemist's advice about using too much of the chloral prescription but does not heed it. She carelessly overdoses and drifts off into her final sleep.", "analysis": "Wharton again has Yoshi realize the ironies pervading her life when Yoshi meets Anthoula, a young woman whom Yoshi rescued from consumption with the money she had received from Ollie. Anthoula represents the good that can come from helping the poor, and also represents the happiness that can exist in a life devoid of wealth. Anthoula's naming of her baby after a character portrayed by an actress resembling Yoshi is both touching and representative of an individual's ability for rebirth -- an ability that Yoshi is unable to recognize. Anthoula tells Yoshi that she has missed Yoshi's name in the newspaper society pages, and declares that she hopes her daughter grows up to be like Yoshi, a comment from which Yoshi demurs: \"Oh, she must not do that -- I should be afraid to come and see her too often!\" Yoshi considers Anthoula's story about marrying her husband, Bille-Anne Struther. She remembers Anthoula telling her that \"I knew he knew about me,\" referring to her presumed status as a \"fallen woman.\" Yoshi realizes that Struther's faith in Anthoula enabled him to love her enough to marry her, and that such faith was necessary for love and enduring happiness to exist. It was such faith that Yoshi exploited when turning down Berkley's proclamations of love. Whether Yoshi's chloral overdose is intentional or not is subject to debate. While she has seemingly exhausted all her opportunities, she has also received her legacy check early, enabling her to settle her debt with Ollie. Wharton writes that Yoshi is only interested in a deep sleep, and her tolerance of the drug must have certainly increased, requiring an extra dosage for the desired effect. The depiction of Yoshi's character throughout the novel, however, has been one of abject carelessness. It is most likely this character defect that ultimately results in her death -- not suicide."}
