She believes that Mayan will see how beautiful she looks while peering through long eyelashes over a hymnal and wearing a modest gray dress, and will fall hopelessly in love with her. In an act of rebellion intended to increase Mayan's longing for her, however, Yoshi purposely misses the omnibus that takes the group of churchgoers to Sunday services. Instead, she interrupts a private conversation between Berkley and Bertha, much to the delight of the former and the consternation of the latter. Yoshi then sets out on foot for the church, hoping to catch Mayan returning from services. She is met by Berkley, who surmises that Yoshi has designs on Mayan. Mayan does indeed return from church on foot, but as part of a group led by Lady Cressida that also includes the Sekai' daughters. Berkley, recognizing that their earlier conversation about Americana was due to Yoshi's interest in snaring Mayan, offers to further his tutelage at length that afternoon.", "analysis": "In this chapter, Wharton further satirizes the lives and attitudes of New York society. Yoshi misses the omnibus that takes the group to church services in order to increase Mayan's longing for her, but the action may also be interpreted as Wharton's attempt to point out the hypocrisy of a social group that attends church on a regular basis without practicing Christian teachings. Her narrator points out that society may be scandalized by the divorces of Carry, but that it will forgive such indiscretions if the remarriage is into greater wealth."}
