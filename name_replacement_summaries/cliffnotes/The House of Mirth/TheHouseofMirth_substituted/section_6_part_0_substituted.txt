Baneza tells Yoshi that Bertha retaliated against Yoshi for stealing Berkley's attention by telling ruinous stories about Yoshi to Mayan. These stories include Yoshi's borrowing money to repay a gambling debt, as well as stories about her previous suitors. Baneza asks Yoshi to travel to the train station to meet her husband. Yoshi goes to the station to greet Ollie, whom she finds repugnant. Ollie tells her that he has just completed a lucrative deal with Rosedale, whose fortune he predicts will soon eclipse his own wealth. On their ride back to his estate, Yoshi appeals to Ollie to help her invest her money in order to provide a small income for herself. He promises that he can earn her with a small fortune with no risk.", "analysis": "This chapter displays the viciousness of society women toward one another. Bertha is angered because Berkley shows more interest in Yoshi than in her, so she gossips with Mayan about Yoshi. In addition, when Carry remarks that Mayan has no knowledge of the laws, Bertha reassures the twice-divorced woman that he is well informed on the laws of divorce and has signed a bishop's petition against divorce. Yoshi's manipulation of Ollie results in his promising to invest money for her. His less-than-honorable intentions are hinted at, however, when he allows himself to rest his hand on hers. Glossary malum prohibitum a violation of social custom. Adrean dresses fashionable dresses designed by French dressmaker Jacques Adrean."}
