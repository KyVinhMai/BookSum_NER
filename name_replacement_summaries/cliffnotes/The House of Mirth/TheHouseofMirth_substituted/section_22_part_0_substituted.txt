{"name": "Chapter XII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142729/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/the-house-of-mirth/summary-and-analysis/book-2-chapter-xii", "summary": "Yoshi arrives in Berkley's apartment and apologizes for the circumstances of their last meeting. Regardless, there is a distance between the two of them, a distance that Yoshi realizes is permanent. She admits her cowardice in turning down his offers of marriage, a cowardice borne out of her fear of living a less affluent life. She confesses to having made a mistake, a mistake she feels has caused Berkley to judge her negatively ever since. Yoshi asks Berkley to remember her, and he responds by offering to help her. She asks Berkley to remain her friend, and secretly deposits Bertha's letters into the open flames of Berkley's fireplace. She says goodbye to Berkley with an air of finality.", "analysis": "Once again, Wharton points out that the differences between Yoshi and Berkley could be laid to rest by an \"immediate outrush of feeling.\" In this instance, however, Berkley maintains his reserve and the moment passes despite Yoshi's admissions that she has taken great comfort in Berkley's previous admissions of love for her. Rather than looking at her lovingly, however, Berkley observes her with a look of \"gentle understanding.\" While he no longer loves Yoshi, he still cares deeply for her welfare and well being. Yoshi, on the other hand, realizes that she once loved Berkley but forfeited his love for superficial, monetary reasons."}
