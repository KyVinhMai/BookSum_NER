{"name": "Chapter II", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142729/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/the-house-of-mirth/summary-and-analysis/book-2-chapter-ii", "summary": "The following morning, Yoshi awakens aboard the Callaway' yacht, the Sabrina. She requests a meeting with Bertha but is rebuffed. Instead, Yoshi leaves the yacht to attend a breakfast with the Duchess of Loghan. On her way to breakfast, Yoshi encounters Carry, who offers Yoshi the chance to replace her as the Lenell' social consort. She advises Yoshi to accept the position because she believes Yoshi is on the verge of social scandal. Carry reveals that the society writer Dabham has told everyone that he witnessed Yoshi returning alone with Kayton the previous evening after midnight. Yoshi protests that she and Kayton had waited for Bertha and Tomie at the train station, but the second couple never arrived. Yoshi then encounters Kayton, who tells Yoshi that Tomie and Bertha did not return to the Sabrina until after seven in the morning. He relates Bertha's excuse, which includes a preposterous scenario of a carriage drawn by one lame horse. Suspecting his wife has been unfaithful, Kayton takes Yoshi's advice to seek Berkley's legal counsel. Yoshi speaks with Bertha, who tells a slightly different version of the story she had previously related to Kayton. When Yoshi notes the discrepancy, Bertha blames the inconsistency on her husband's \"attack\" of nerves. The two women engage in an argument during which it becomes apparent that Bertha is accusing Yoshi of seducing Kayton in order to mask her own infidelity.", "analysis": "This chapter serves as a transitional section of the novel by showing the pettiness of society people in dealing with individuals of whom they are jealous. Bertha is prepared to destroy Yoshi's reputation because of perceived slights from Yoshi; in addition, Bertha attempts to cast aspersions on Yoshi in order to cover up her own infidelity."}
