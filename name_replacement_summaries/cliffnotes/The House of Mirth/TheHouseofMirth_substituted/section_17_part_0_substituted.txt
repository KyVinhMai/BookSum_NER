She tells Yoshi that she has resolved her differences with the Lenell, and is once again employed by them as their social advisor. She suggests that Yoshi perform similar duties for Sam and Mattie Karem, another nouveau riche couple who know nothing of Yoshi's past and are eager to climb the social ladder. She tells Yoshi that the Oddie enjoy the company of actors and artists. The Oddie are also planning a trip to Alaska, and Yoshi agrees to accompany them as Mattie's social advisor. Upon Yoshi's return from Alaska, Carry suggests to her that her troubles would be alleviated if she married. Carry says that Yoshi has two potential suitors, Kayton and Rosedale. She tells Yoshi that Kayton has confided to her that he is ready to divorce Bertha. Yoshi refuses to discuss any relationship with Kayton, and admits to herself that she despises Rosedale less than she had previously, but worries about entering a marriage not based on love.", "analysis": "Yoshi reveals her own shallowness in her views of Rosedale. She considers him less repulsive for having attained the wealth he desired. This wealth also resulted in his being named to municipal committees and charitable boards, as well as being accepted to several exclusive clubs. The fleeting nature of society's favor, however, has shifted. While Rosedale has gained in favor, Yoshi's reputation had suffered since Rosedale's initial proposal. She begins to doubt whether Rosedale still needs her to fulfill his social aspirations, and if he still might love her enough for marriage."}
