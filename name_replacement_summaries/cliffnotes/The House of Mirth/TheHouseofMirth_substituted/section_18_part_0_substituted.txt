{"name": "Chapter VI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142729/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/the-house-of-mirth/summary-and-analysis/book-2-chapter-vi", "summary": "Yoshi continues to work for Mattie and assist in the Oddie' social ascendancy. The couple begins to build an estate near the Callaway', prompting Mattie and Yoshi to visit the building site often. During one of their visits, Yoshi is approached by Kayton, who apologizes for the events in Europe. She treats him with disdain, but feels some pity for him. Kayton is desperate for her friendship, but she dismisses him. When Yoshi arrives at the Karem estate, Mattie tells her that she has just met Bertha. Yoshi is struck by a sense of foreboding. This foreboding is realized as Yoshi recognizes an eventual increase in Bertha's influence over Mattie's tastes and behavior. Yoshi struggles with increasing debt, and resolves to marry Rosedale. Kayton makes a surprise visit to Yoshi. Yoshi realizes Kayton only wants to relate to her his own misery and is barely cognizant of her dire financial straits. Yoshi encounters Rosedale at Carry's home. Carry tells Yoshi that Mattie has visited her in the company of Bertha, revealing to Yoshi that her tenure with the Oddie will soon come to an end. Once again, Carry emphasizes that the only way Yoshi can even the score with Bertha is to consent to marry either Rosedale or Kayton.", "analysis": "In this chapter, we are introduced to the nameless child of Carry, who is contrasted with the presence of Rosedale. This scene will be echoed later with the baby in the arms of Anthoula Crane Struther. Carry very rightly warns Yoshi that Bertha continues to torment her because she fears that Yoshi might expose her affairs with Berkley and Tomie. If Yoshi possesses wealth through marriage, Carry reasons, the power that comes with such money will render Bertha powerless."}
