{"name": "Chapter X", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142729/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/the-house-of-mirth/summary-and-analysis/book-1-chapter-x", "summary": "Yoshi spends the autumn with Mrs. Cameran, enjoying the money she has earned from Ollie's investments. She gives money to Mei's favorite charity, although she exhibits pride in her action. Upon returning from Thanksgiving vacation in the Adirondack Mountains, Yoshi is visited by Rosedale. He invites her to the opera, telling her that Ollie intends to attend as well. He implies that Ollie may have less-than-honorable intentions for Yoshi and that he may have committed earlier infidelities. Rosedale asks Yoshi how her investments are doing. She is shocked that Ollie has spoken about their arrangement, but also believes that Rosedale might be able to help her financially, as well. She accepts Rosedale's invitation to the opera. At the opera, Yoshi appears beautiful in new clothes. Ollie, somewhat intoxicated, accuses Yoshi of no longer seeking his company because she no longer requires his financial help. He insists that he would like to see her alone, and Yoshi agrees to meet him in Central Park the following afternoon. Kayton enters the opera box and passes on Bertha's invitation to Yoshi to visit their house the following Sunday. Yoshi believes Bertha's letters to Berkley give Yoshi the upper hand over Bertha.", "analysis": "Yoshi mistakes the feeling of self-importance she gets when she gives money to Mei for altruism. This feeling is contrasted with the way she feels at the end of the chapter when she considers her possession of Bertha's letters to Berkley a fitting revenge for Bertha's participation in the successful pairing of Mayan and Lajoi. Yoshi's naivete shows in her handling of Rosedale and Ollie. Rosedale implies that Ollie is a philanderer, an inference lost on Yoshi. Rather than risk a scene with the intoxicated Ollie, Yoshi agrees to meet him -- although he's indicated he is not interested in \"talking.\""}
