While she is in London, the Callaway, Lenell, and SteAustyn return to New York with their own versions of Yoshi's exploits in Europe. Upon her return from London, Yoshi is told that her aunt and benefactor, Mrs. Cameran, has died. At the reading of the will, she is surprised to learn that Grace has been the left the majority of Mrs. Cameran's estate, and that Yoshi will receive only $10,000. Yoshi is determined to use her inheritance to settle her debt with Ollie. She discusses the Callaway' shunning her and her meek inheritance with Mei. Rather than relate the actual details of the incident to Mei, Yoshi tells her that an accusation is as good as the truth in society. The two go to lunch and are joined by Carry, who is glad to see Yoshi. While dining with Mei, Yoshi encounters Baneza. She notices that Baneza is cordial, but she also conspicuously refrains from asking Yoshi about her future and further neglects to express a desire to see her again. Desperate for money, Yoshi goes to Grace to borrow money against her inheritance. Grace tells Yoshi that the estate will not be settled for some time. She refuses the request to borrow money against the inheritance on the grounds that Mrs. Cameran did not condone borrowing. Grace also tells Yoshi that Mrs. Cameran's meager allotment to Yoshi was intended as an admonishment for Yoshi's behavior.", "analysis": "Wharton displays the shallowness of New York society by depicting the reading of the will as an episode of respect shown toward Yoshi -- for as long as the attendees at the reading believe that Yoshi will be the sole benefactor. When she receives only $10,000, Yoshi notices an immediate change in their behavior toward her."}
