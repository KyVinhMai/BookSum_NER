Berkley meets with Kayton and fears the worst for Yoshi's reputation. Yoshi remains aboard the Sabrina despite the tension between the Callaway and Bertha's harsh treatment of Yoshi. Yoshi goes to town and encounters Berkley, who relates his concern for Yoshi's reputation. He worries that Yoshi is unable to defend herself socially from Bertha's wrath, and advises Yoshi to leave the Callaway' yacht during a dinner hosted by the Lenell. Yoshi asserts that she is in no danger, but Berkley's fears are later realized when Bertha announces to the group that Yoshi will not return with them to the Sabrina. Berkley accompanies Yoshi from the dinner party, vowing to help her find a place to stay. He receives SteTai's permission to let Yoshi spend the night at their hotel provided that she not disturb SteTai's sleeping wife, Occie, and that she leave by train the following morning.", "analysis": "Berkley's attitude toward Yoshi has transformed from smitten suitor to protector. He realizes that Yoshi's behavior has been reckless, but he also acknowledges that she is incapable of defending herself from the implications of being exiled by Bertha. Berkley's later behavior is hinted at when Wharton reveals that he has developed a \"sense of privilege\" through his association with the Lenell and SteAustyn. Perhaps nowhere else in the novel is Wharton as disparaging toward the wealthy social class as when she presents Berkley's observations of the contrasts between Yoshi and the other dinner guests. She depicts the gossip columnist Dabham as a social parasite. She has Berkley observe the \"ideals of a world where conspicuousness passed for distinction, and the society column had become the roll of fame.\" Such is the society that will cast off one of its own regardless of the merits of the charges against her."}
