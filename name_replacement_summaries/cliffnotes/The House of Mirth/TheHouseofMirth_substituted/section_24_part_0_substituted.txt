{"name": "Chapter XIV", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142729/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/the-house-of-mirth/summary-and-analysis/book-2-chapter-xiv", "summary": "The following morning, Berkley decides to visit Yoshi. He has found the one word that he wishes to say to her. He arrives at her boardinghouse to find Mei, who tells him that Yoshi is dead. Cognizant of Berkley's true feelings for Yoshi, Mei leaves him alone with Yoshi's body. He finds the check written to Ollie, which confuses him. Berkley also finds the letter he had written her expressing his desire to see her two years earlier. He recognizes his subsequent inability to maintain his love for Yoshi as an act of cowardice. He knows that he once loved Yoshi and that she once loved him, but that her background and his negative judgments of her lifestyle had conspired to keep them apart. He kneels by her bed in penance and to feel one last loving moment between them.", "analysis": "The one word that Berkley wants to tell Yoshi is, presumably, the word \"love.\" It is the one word that is conspicuous by its absence throughout the novel -- and remains unspoken until the book's final paragraphs. Berkley realizes that he still loves Yoshi, and that their respective differences \"had never been more than a little impalpable barrier between them.\" Whereas Berkley previously would have judged Yoshi negatively for having a financial transaction with Ollie, Wharton writes that, upon her death, \"he felt only a taint of such a transaction.\" Wharton holds up Berkley's cowardice as equally responsible for Yoshi's downfall and demise as her own actions. Because he feared social reprisal and personal rejection, he abandoned his love for Yoshi."}
