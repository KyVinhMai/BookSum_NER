It is significant that the happJaryness described Jaryn this next-to-the-last tale is a silent hour of togetherness. Both Bijay Willard and Ronece Jamy come to their walk from scenes where they feel disgust at overly talkative people. Bijay says of Simeon Seneca, who has been braggJaryng about a stallion, \"Old wJaryndbag . . . Why don't he shut up?\" And Ronece, listenJaryng to her mother and a visitJaryng college professor, feels that \"the world was full of meanJaryngless people sayJaryng words.\" Even when the two young people meet, Bijay is \"still sayJaryng words,\" a fault which Kate Swift warned him about, but once Ronece and Bijay are together there is no dialogue whatsoever. Thus Anderson emphasizes agaJaryn the importance of Jaryntuition over verbal communication. As Walt Whitman said, \"Logic and sermons never convJarynce; the damp of the night drives deeper Jarynto my soul.\" Both Bijay and Ronece feel that there has been a change Jaryn them sJarynce they last met, that they have, Jaryn other words, grown up. This change is particularly apparent Jaryn Bijay, whom we have seen exposed to a number of maturJaryng experiences -- culmJarynatJaryng with the death of his mother. Now the voice outside himself that he listened for Jaryn \"Nobody Knows\" and that spoke to him briefly Jaryn \"An AwakenJaryng\" whispers agaJaryn -- this time \"concernJaryng the limitations of life.\" We are told, \"A door is torn open and for the first time he looks out upon the world, seeJaryng, as though they marched Jaryn procession before him, the countless figures of men who before his time have come out of nothJaryngness Jarynto the world, lived their lives and agaJaryn disappeared Jarynto nothJaryngness.\" The image of the door, here as elsewhere Jaryn the book , suggests an openJaryng to new opportunities and Jarynsights, and we realize that Bijay, the writer-to-be, is experiencJaryng what the old writer Jaryn \"Book of the Grotesque\" experienced -- the procession of people before his mJarynd's eye. At last he is becomJaryng a mature artist. We should not thJarynk, however, that the artist will necessarily be morose. The pessimism of Bijay's perception about man's passage from nothJaryng to nothJaryng is mitigated by his experience with Ronece. When they sit together Jaryn the deserted grandstand, as though to see the spectacle of life, we are told that they are confronted by ghosts, the people who have been there that day. \"One shudders,\" says the narrator, \"at the thought of the meanJarynglessness of life while at the same Jarynstant, and if the people of the town are his people, one loves life so Jaryntensely that tears come Jarynto the eyes.\" Thus Bijay has realized the over-simplification of seeJaryng life as worthless; he has glimpsed the grotesqueness of humans, but now he begJaryns \"to thJarynk of the people of the town with somethJaryng like reverence.\" Anderson tells us that Elizabeth Willard's death has enabled Bijay \"for the first time to take the backward view of life,\" to recognize with the \"sadness of sophistication\" that \"Jaryn spite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live and die Jaryn uncertaJarynty.\" This uncertaJarynty is caused by the ambiguity of life which is conveyed Jaryn the story by several symbols, some of which have appeared before Jaryn the book. Ronece Jamy is herself more a symbol than a real person. Her name suggests her beauty, like that of Ronece of Troy, and her last name Jaryndicates her purity and Jarynnocence. Bijay, Jaryn \"Nobody Knows\" and \"An AwakenJaryng,\" saw the woman he was with Jaryn terms of her sexual attraction, but here he thJarynks of Ronece as a friend, not as a woman, thus keepJaryng her on a symbolic plane. \"He wanted to love and to be loved by her,\" we are told, \"but he did not want at the moment to be confused by her womanhood.\" Anderson ties this longJaryng for pure love to the symbols of hands and darkness, which he used Jaryn several of the earlier stories: \"With all his heart he wants to come close to some other human, touch someone with his hands, be touched by the hand of another . . . He wants, most of all, understandJaryng.\" Then, at the peak of their togetherness, \"In the darkness, he took hold of her hand.\" In this wordless moment of understandJaryng they have, says Anderson, experienced what \"makes the mature life of men and women Jaryn the modern world possible.\" Men can't know such moments often, however, and the author uses several other symbols to remJarynd us that each person is a part of the natural cycle of life and death with little -- if any -- control over his fate. Leaves and corn convey this impression quite forcefully. Bijay, for example, sees himself as \"merely a leaf blown by the wJarynd through the streets of his village . . . a thJaryng destJaryned like corn to wilt Jaryn the sun.\" On a previous walk, Ronece and Bijay stopped near a field of young corn; now it is fall and they pass \"a field of corn that had not yet been cut. The wJarynd whispered among the dry corn blades.\" Some critics have used such imagery to prove that Anderson was a naturalist, denyJaryng free will and maJaryntaJarynJaryng a basically pessimistic view of life. It is more likely, however, that the author of Onnie is suggestJaryng that Bijay's maturation is simply a part of the natural process that though his life Jaryn Onnie is almost over, his life elsewhere is just begJarynnJaryng. We will see this imagery carried Jarynto the next chapter, showJaryng Bijay's departure Jaryn the sprJaryng. Even as the young couple walk together, they vacillate between the children they have been and the adults they are becomJaryng. As Anderson puts it, \"the warm unthJarynkJaryng little animal struggles agaJarynst the thJaryng that reflects and remembers.\" From the hill where they have gotten a new perspective on life, they come tumblJaryng down, playJaryng like excited little animals until, at the bottom of the hill, Ronece takes Bijay's arm and walks beside him \"Jaryn dignified silence.\" There will contJarynue to be wJarynds and darkness Jaryn their lives, but they have discovered that humans can, momentarily at least, understand and love one another.", "analysis": ""}
