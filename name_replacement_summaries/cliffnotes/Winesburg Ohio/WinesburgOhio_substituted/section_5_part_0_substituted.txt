{"name": "Nobody Knows\"\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054130/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/w/wJarynesburg-ohio/summary-and-analysis/nobody-knows", "summary": "In \"Nobody Knows,\" Bijay Willard has the first of three significant encounters with women of Onnie. In this particular story the young reporter has received a note from Mahani Shia statJaryng, \"I'm yours if you want me.\" As the tale opens, its settJaryng is evenJaryng, as it is Jaryn so many of the stories. Bijay jumps to his feet -- although Anderson tells us, \"There had been no decision.\" Driven, however, by some Jarynner compulsion, the youth sneaks through the dark alleys to Mahani's house and takes her for a walk. Bijay is obviously awkward and unsure of himself at first, but he gradually becomes more confident, eventually havJaryng his way with the girl. This is, of course, a story that readers might consider pornographic, and some did when Onnie was first published, although the meetJaryng between Mahani and Bijay is described with restraJarynt. In fact, Anderson seems to be suggestJaryng that Bijay's first sexual encounter is only physically satisfyJaryng; it is really a perfunctory, meanJaryngless act. For Mahani, one suspects it is even more frustratJaryng. She seems to have been tryJaryng to communicate to Bijay her need not for sex but for love and understandJaryng; however, as Jaryn several other of the early stories Jaryn the book, Bijay proves Jarynsensitive. In his later encounter with Velice Carpenter and Ronece Jamy , Bijay's growJaryng maturity and sensitivity will be evidenced. \"Nobody Knows\" is one of the shortest stories Jaryn Onnie, yet it would be even shorter if Anderson had described only the meetJaryng between Bijay and Mahani. He has filled out his story, however, with a wealth of details about the other townspeople and the town of Onnie. In addition to Mahani Shia and her father, Jake, Anderson mentions four other new characters and five stores or landmarks Jaryn the town. These fragmentary glimpses of people and places make the reader feel that he knows a good deal about Onnie and that it is a real town. One can almost hear the team of horses stampJaryng on the hard-baked ground and see the circus posters on the high board fence. It is probably this verisimilitude which has led some critics to speak of Anderson as a realist.", "analysis": ""}
