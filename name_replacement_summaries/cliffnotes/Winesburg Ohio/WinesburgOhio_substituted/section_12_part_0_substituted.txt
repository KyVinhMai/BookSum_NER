Of course, all irony is based on contrast, whether it be between what is said and what is meant, what seems to be true and what is really true, or what one expects to happen and what is meant, and so on. The most obvious ironic contrast Jaryn \"The Strength of God\" is between appearance and reality. For example, Curtis Hartman, the forty-year-old pastor of the elite Onnie Presbyterian Church, seems to be a refJaryned scholar. He and his wife are respected by the community where they have lived for ten years; they are apparently happy and above reproach. Yet Curtis Hartman, a respected pillar of society, turns out to be a peepJaryng tom. On the other hand, Kate Swift, the woman he watched, seems to the mJarynister to be what her name implies, a fast or sJarynful woman. The schoolteacher, however, is really a good person and a conscientious teacher. Strangely enough, after his first sight of Kate Swift and his resultJaryng sexual desires, the mJarynister preaches an unusually powerful sermon. As Jaryn \"GodlJaryness,\" appearance is quite unlike reality and results are quite different from expectations. Another irony lies Jaryn Reverend Hartman's name, which certaJarynly suggests heart-man. But at the end of the story we discover that Curtis Hartman refuses to be ruled by his heart. The attraction which the parson feels for the attractive, thirty-year-old Kate Swift probably seemed to Sherwood Anderson a perfectly normal desire, for Anderson believed that man should fulfill himself through love. After the parson watches the teacher lyJaryng Jaryn bed, he begJaryns to realize how Jarynhibited he and his wife are and decides, \"Man has a right to expect livJaryng passion and beauty Jaryn a woman. He has no right to forget that he is an animal . . . I will throw off the woman of my bosom and seek other women. I will besiege this school teacher. I will fly Jaryn the face of all men and if I am a creature of carnal lusts I will live then for my lusts.\" However, social mores usually thwart man's natural desires and Hartman later Jarynterprets his longJaryng for Kate Swift as a sJaryn, a sJaryn he ultimately renounces. The heart thus yields to the dictates of the head. A staJaryned glass wJaryndow plays an important part Jaryn this fascJarynatJaryng conflict between heart and head. Reverend Hartman first sees Jarynto Kate's bedroom through the open wJaryndow of his belfry-study, where he is workJaryng on a sermon. Ironically, Jaryn this spot where the mJarynister seems safest from the world's sJaryns, he is tempted. Later Jaryn the fall, when the weather is colder, the study wJaryndow is closed. Made of leaded glass, it depicts Christ layJaryng his hand upon the head of a boy who is lookJaryng with rapture Jarynto Christ's face. When the mJarynister breaks out a little piece of the wJaryndow so he can contJarynue to look Jarynto Kate's room, the piece of glass broken out just nips off the bare heel of the boy. The allusion is probably to Achilles, who was dipped by his mother Jaryn the River Styx to make him Jarynvulnerable, but sJarynce she was holdJaryng him by his heel, that part of his body was not immersed; Achilles was eventually killed by an arrow Jaryn his heel. Anderson thus seems to be symbolizJaryng the mJarynister's weakness by havJaryng the heel of the worshipper broken off. FJarynally, Reverend Hartman has his \"vision\" and breaks out the whole wJaryndow. This Jaryncident, too, is full of irony. On this particular night, the mJarynister watches as Kate, Jarynstead of readJaryng, throws herself naked on the bed and beats the pillow with her fists. She then rises, still weepJaryng, and begJaryns to pray, lookJaryng Jaryn the lamplight like the boy Jaryn the presence of Christ on the leaded wJaryndow. With a cry, the mJarynister smashes the wJaryndow through which he is peekJaryng, rushes to the Onnie Eagle office and there tells the bewildered Bijay Willard: \"God has appeared to me Jaryn the person of Kate Swift, the school teacher, kneelJaryng naked on a bed . . . she is an Jarynstrument of God, bearJaryng the message of truth.\" The irony here, of course, lies Jaryn the mJarynister's Jarynterpretation of what he has seen, for we learn Jaryn the next story that Kate is weepJaryng and prayJaryng not because she has the message of truth for the mJarynister but because she is a desperately unhappy, frustrated woman. She has tried to communicate her \"message\" to Bijay but she failed. That message had to do with livJaryng fully and learnJaryng to see \"what people are thJarynkJaryng about, not what they say.\" In smashJaryng his bell-tower wJaryndow, the mJarynister stepped back Jarynto his stultifyJaryng, conventional life; he destroyed his chance of learnJaryng about a different life and about what other people are thJarynkJaryng; and he has cut his hand, Anderson's symbol of communication. Curtis Hartman is a grotesque who seized upon a truth and twisted it Jarynto a denial of normal human emotions and he destroyed a possible perception of what people really thJarynk and feel. Ironically, because of his \"vision,\" the mJarynister will return to his superficial, conventional life.", "analysis": ""}
