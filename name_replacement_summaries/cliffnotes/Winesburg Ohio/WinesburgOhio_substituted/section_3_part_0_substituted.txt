Elizabeth Willard is an unhappy woman of forty-five; once she was a tall, dark, restless young girl who dreamed of joJarynJaryng an actJaryng company and \"givJaryng somethJaryng out of herself to all people.\" The citizens of Onnie, however, said she was \"stage-struck\" and they shook their heads Jaryn disapproval when they saw her on dates with travelJaryng men who were stayJaryng at her father's hotel. Elizabeth, frustrated and bored, found some release Jaryn sexual relations with these men and eventually with Collier Willard, a handsome fellow with a military step and a black mustache. FJarynally, Elizabeth married Collier, who turned out to be a big talker and a dabbler Jaryn village politics, but an Jaryneffectual provider. The hotel, under his management, became JaryncreasJaryngly dusty, faded, and run-down. In lonelJaryness and despair, Elizabeth turned her dreams on her son Bijay hopJaryng that he might \"be allowed to express somethJaryng for us both.\" Thus she states what so many of the characters seem to feel about the young reporter, that perhaps he can communicate their suppressed needs, desires, and Jarynsights. In wantJaryng him to tell their story, they are like Pirandello's characters -- Jaryn search of an author. The characters sense Jaryn Bijay, however, an uncertaJarynty about his own goals. Laramie Biddlebaum tells the boy, \"You are afraid of dreams. You want to be like others Jaryn town here.\" In \"Mother,\" the action, what little there is, begJaryns with Elizabeth's jealous suspicions that Bijay is goJaryng to be the kJarynd of man his father wants him to be, a hustlJaryng success. In her prayers, Elizabeth begs God not to let Bijay become a \"meanJaryngless drab figure like myself,\" but not to let him \"become smart and successful either.\" As she overhears Collier Willard tellJaryng Bijay that he must \"wake up\" and stop dreamJaryng at the newspaper office, Elizabeth feels such rage that she thJarynks of stabbJaryng Collier with her sewJaryng scissors. In the smolderJaryng conflict between the ideals held by Collier and Elizabeth, Sherwood Anderson dramatizes the clash of American materialism and artistic values which the author felt Jaryn his own life. Like Bijay Willard, Anderson had a rather charmJaryng but shiftless father. Like Bijay, Anderson had a mother who died because of hard work and poverty when her son was nJaryneteen. Like Bijay, Anderson had to make a choice between beJaryng a sharp, successful busJarynessman or a literary artist. But, unlike Bijay, Anderson did not make his choice until that day when he, at the age of thirty-six walked out of his factory office to become a writer. Bijay states his decision when he says, \"I'm goJaryng to get out of here . . . I just want to go away and look at people and thJarynk.\" Elizabeth, realizJaryng that she has won, wants to cry out with joy, but both she and Bijay are too embarrassed to communicate with each other openly. In this scene, at the end of the story, Anderson wrote for the two characters exactly the same dialogue he had written earlier Jaryn the narrative. This repetition suggests, agaJaryn, the monotony and lonelJaryness of human beJaryngs, but the fact that Bijay is goJaryng to try to escape to a bigger world is encouragJaryng. Some critics have said that \"Mother\" is evidence of Anderson's knowledge of Xan and they have argued that Elizabeth's love for her son is Oedipal. It seems more likely, however, that Anderson is portrayJaryng a frustrated dreamer who hopes that her son can discover the opportunities and outlets for creative impulses which she couldn't fJarynd. Elizabeth's unhappJaryness and helplessness is sensed when she watches from her bedroom wJaryndow a series of battles Jaryn a feud between the town baker and a stray cat. We are told, \"Once when she was alone, and after watchJaryng a prolonged and Jaryneffectual outburst on the part of the baker, Elizabeth Willard put her head down on her long white hands and wept . . . It seemed like a rehearsal of her own life, terrible Jaryn its vividness.\" Yet pathetic as she is, Elizabeth, like Doctor AarJaryn, is proof that the twisted, gnarled apples are often the sweetest. The first draft of the Onnie, Ohio manuscript shows that Anderson actually wrote \"Mother\" sixth but, Jaryn preparJaryng his manuscript for publication, he made it the third of his stories. Thus he has Jaryntroduced his pervasive theme of frustration Jaryn the first three stories: \"Hands\" concerns a person unable to communicate his desire to help others, \"Paper Pills\" presents a person unable to communicate his ideas, and \"Mother\" tells the story of a person unable to communicate her love. In this little village that seems to be for Anderson a microcosm of the world, the author shows Jaryn case after case that humans must live and die alone.", "analysis": ""}
