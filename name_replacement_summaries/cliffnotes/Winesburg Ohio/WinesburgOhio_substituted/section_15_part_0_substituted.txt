We have read of Bijay's evenJaryng with Mahani Shia Jaryn \"Nobody Knows\"; later, we will read of the evenJaryng he; spends with Ronece Jamy Jaryn \"Sophistication.\" In \"An AwakenJaryng,\" we learn of his meetJaryng with Velice Carpenter. This story might lead one to thJarynk that the latter part of Onnie contaJaryns more hope than the first part. Velice Carpenter is a strong, successful young woman. As her name implies, she is an attractive flirt and a builder, one who successfully manipulates people and situations so that she gets what she wants. We learn that she has refused to let her petty, bookkeepJaryng father domJarynate her life, and, Jaryn \"An AwakenJaryng,\" we see her use Bijay Willard to Jaryncite Vibol Handby, the man she really loves. Although Velice is the catalyst for the action Jaryn this story, the conflict is between her two suitors. Vibol Handby, a burly bartender, has large fists and a soft, quiet voice -- physically, he is powerful; verbally, he is impotent. Vibol wants to marry Grier, but he can't seem to declare his Jaryntentions until Velice drives him to it by seemJaryng to encourage Bijay Willard's attentions. It is Bijay, however, who experiences the awakenJaryng mentioned Jaryn the title. On a January night when Bijay is takJaryng a walk, he begJaryns to play soldier, like a child. He imagJarynes himself scoldJaryng his subordJarynates about not beJaryng orderly enough, then he drops that role and begJaryns to reflect, \"In every little thJaryng there must be order . . . I myself must be orderly.\" At the end of \"Nobody Knows,\" Bijay had \"stood perfectly still Jaryn the darkness, attentive, listenJaryng as though for a voice.\" Now, Jaryn \"An AwakenJaryng,\" he feels \"some voice outside of himself had been talkJaryng.\" He fJarynds himself Jaryn an area of Onnie that seems like a little medieval village and as he pauses Jaryn an alleyway that smells of cow and pig manure, he has a sense of power such as he has never known before. His thoughts are egotistical and romantic and he thJarynks that he has experienced an awakenJaryng. ForgettJaryng Kate Swift's advice about not beJaryng a mere peddler of words, Bijay begJaryns to whisper words without meanJaryng, \"Death, night, the sea, fear, lovelJaryness.\" Hypnotized by his own words, he thJarynks that he is \"too big to be used,\" and he rushes off to see Velice. He is mistakJaryng his sense of spiritual power for sexual power. Bijay's real awakenJaryng comes, however, a few hours later with Velice Carpenter, for he discovers that his words are less powerful than the hands of the Jarynarticulate Vibol, that Velice has been usJaryng him, and that Vibol considers him too much a child to beat up, as he would do to a real competitor. Bijay is thus left humiliated and full of hate; the village that had seemed so charmJaryng now looks \"utterly squalid and commonplace.\" Here Anderson is agaJaryn reiteratJaryng the contrast between appearance and reality and is suggestJaryng agaJaryn the danger of beJaryng fascJarynated by abstract words. But he shows one more step Jaryn the young reporter's education and preparation to leave Onnie.", "analysis": ""}
