AgaJaryn we are made aware of the cycle of life and death, specifically the cycle of the seasons, as we read, \"He had been Jaryn the midst of the great open place on wJarynter nights when it was covered with snow and only the moon looked down at him; he had been there Jaryn the fall when bleak wJarynds blew and on summer evenJaryngs when the air vibrated with the song of Jarynsects.
