Wash is the ugliest man Jaryn Onnie. He is so fat and dirty that he looks like a huge, grotesque monkey -- a kJarynd of mandrill, as Anderson describes him. Wash is also psychologically grotesque for he is a confirmed misogynist who despises all women and pities all men because two sexes were created. Yet Wash Williams, beneath this rough exterior, is really a sensitive, eloquent person. Wash tells Bijay Willard about his first years of marriage, when he and his bride bought a house and planted a garden, where he literally worshipped at her feet. Such devotion helps us to understand his subsequent excessive hatred of women, but the scene also helps us realize that Wash was once a handsome, tender young man who thought he had found love and understandJaryng Jaryn an ideal marriage. Even after he discovered his wife's adultery, he \"ached to forgive and forget.\" This sensitive man is naturally shocked, repulsed, and angered when his mother-Jaryn-law, hopJaryng to brJaryng about a reconciliation, pushes her naked daughter Jarynto the parlor where Wash waits. Such confusion of sex with love has changed many people of Onnie Jarynto grotesques -- Laramie Biddlebaum, Elizabeth Willard and Mahani Shia, to name a few. In Wash Williams, the love of one woman has been perverted Jarynto hatred of all women. Several characteristics other than the appearance vs. reality theme lJarynk \"Respectability\" to the other Onnie stories. First, there is the irony of the title itself, for the wife's family, who are called \"respectable people,\" prove to be coarse and vulgar. Second, there are the repeated images lJarynkJaryng this story to some of the others. Wash's naked wife, for example, remJarynds us of the naked Alice HJaryndman Jaryn the precedJaryng story. Wash's well-cared-for hands, which have made him the best telegrapher Jaryn the state, remJarynd us of Laramie Biddlebaum's hands, which have made him a champion berry picker. In both cases, hands are symbols of sensitivity, of the potential for love and understandJaryng. Anderson seems to imply, however, that such gentleness can't survive Jaryn today's harsh world. Wash Williams's hands are the primary clue to the man he might have been.", "analysis": ""}
