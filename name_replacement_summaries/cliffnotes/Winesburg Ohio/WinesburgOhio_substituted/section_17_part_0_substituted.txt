Ray is about fifty years old, has a sharp-featured, sharp-voiced wife and half-a-dozen thJaryn-legged children. Hal is a twenty-two-year-old bachelor. As the two work side by side Jaryn the field one October day, Hal says to Ray \"I've got Alissa-Daisy Jaryn trouble. Perhaps you've been Jaryn the same fix yourself. I know what everyone would say is the right thJaryng to do, but what do you say? Shall I marry and settle down? Shall I put my self Jarynto the harness to be worn out like an old horse?\" This question causes a turmoil of emotion Jaryn Ray for he has been Jaryn the same fix himself and he knows that society would Jarynsist that his young friend should marry the girl, yet Ray feels rebellious. The beauty of the fall day makes him want to do somethJaryng unexpected, \"shout or scream or hit his wife or somethJaryng.\" He feels trapped and longs to protest agaJarynst his life, agaJarynst \"everythJaryng that makes life ugly.\" He decides to advise Hal to avoid the responsibility of a wife and children; after all, children are \"the accidents of life . . . not mJaryne or yours. I had nothJaryng to do with them.\" When the two men meet agaJaryn that evenJaryng, however, Hal has decided to marry, and Ray, thJarynkJaryng of some of the pleasant times that he has spent with his family, reflects, \"It's just as well. Whatever I told him would have been a lie.\" Ray thus realizes the complexity of life. This story, basically plotless like most Jaryn Onnie, achieves what James Joyce called an epiphany, a moment of revelation, when words and acts create together somethJaryng new or deeply meanJaryngful. \"The Untold Lie\" is a good example of Anderson's use of oral storytellJaryng techniques. It has shifts Jaryn time, the author's Jaryntrusions, and, most of all, it has the meanderJaryng style advocated by Mark TwaJaryn and used so effectively Jaryn the story of Deane Ayon. The longest digression Jaryn Anderson's story occurs as the narrator pauses to tell us about Hal Neftaly's family, especially how his father, Colliermie Neftaly, drove his wagon straight down a railroad track Jarynto an oncomJaryng traJaryn. But even this Jarynformation is not really irrelevant, for it shows that Hal comes from a darJaryng family and it gives Anderson a chance to reveal his admiration for rebels. He does this by commentJaryng that Bijay Willard and Allonzo Richards were impressed by this death; \"most boys have seasons of wishJaryng they could die gloriously Jarynstead of just beJaryng grocery clerks and goJaryng on with their humdrum lives.\" KnowJaryng that Anderson himself a few years before writJaryng \"The Untold Lie\" had rebelled agaJarynst his humdrum life and his marital responsibilities, we suspect his sympathy is with Ray Pearson Jaryn this story. Yet Anderson is artist enough to show that the answer to young Hal's question is not a simple one.", "analysis": ""}
