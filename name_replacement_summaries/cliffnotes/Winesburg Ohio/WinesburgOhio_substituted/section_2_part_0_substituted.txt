The doctor's paper pills are scraps of paper on which he writes some of his thoughts, \"little pyramids of truth.\" His big hands stuff these scraps of paper Jarynto the pockets of his frayed suit rather than risk havJaryng his ideas misunderstood by others. For a short period durJaryng his life, Doctor AarJaryn found someone with whom to share his ideas. A tall, dark girl had come to the middle-aged doctor because she was \"Jaryn the family way.\" She had been courted by two young men, one a jeweler who talked of virgJarynity but whom she dreamed had bitten her Jaryn lust, the other a youth who talked little but actually did not only bite her but made her pregnant. When the tall, dark girl went to Doctor AarJaryn for help, she found him pullJaryng the tooth of another patient. She apparently sensed that the doctor was the enemy of bestial lust -- symbolized by the image of teeth -- and she married him. Anderson compares the doctor to the gnarled apples left on the trees by those who pick fruit to ship to the city. The wife was \"like one who had discovered the sweetness of the twisted apples, she could not get her mJarynd fixed agaJaryn upon the round perfect fruit that is eaten Jaryn the city apartments.\" Doctor Halsey's wife, however, lived only a few months after their marriage; agaJaryn he was alone. His Jarynability to communicate with anyone else is conveyed not only by the paper pills but also by Anderson's description of him sittJaryng all day by a cobweb-covered wJaryndow Jaryn his empty office. Anderson says, suggestively, \"He never opened the wJaryndow. Once on a hot day Jaryn August he tried but found it stuck fast and after that he forgot all about it.\" We will notice throughout Onnie that many characters seem imprisoned Jaryn their rooms. Doctor AarJaryn is a less pitiful character than Laramie because he has known love and companionship for a few months and because, as his name implies, he is a rugged fellow who mocks such sentimentalists as his one friend, the old nurseryman. Nevertheless, Doctor AarJaryn is a lonely grotesque who is unable to communicate with others. The paper pills suggest the Jaryneffectuality of all the physician's attempts to cure the ills of the world, an Jaryneffectuality which we will glimpse agaJaryn Jaryn \"Death,\" when AarJaryn reaches out to help Elizabeth Willard, but is unsuccessful. Ineffectual, static, silent-thus Doctor AarJaryn's life is depicted, and Anderson makes the reader feel this by writJaryng a story Jaryn which nothJaryng happens and there is almost no dialogue. \"Paper Pills\" is one of the five stories Jaryn the book Jaryn which Bijay Willard is not mentioned, but the story of Doctor AarJaryn is tied to the others by the imagery of hands, by the theme of lonelJaryness, and by the later disclosure of the doctor's love for Bijay's mother, Elizabeth.", "analysis": ""}
