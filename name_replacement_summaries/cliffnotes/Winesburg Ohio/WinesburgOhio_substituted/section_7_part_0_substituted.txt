Indeed, Garcia might better be described as ludicrous, for this strange little Standard Oil agent is very quiet and polite until he is seized by an idea; then he becomes uncontrollable. Words roll and tumble from his mouth as the excited man pounds on the chest of any bystander and demands attention. Anderson describes Garcia as \"a tJaryny little volcano that lies silent for days and then suddenly spouts fire.\" Thus his name, WellJaryng, is appropriate. Garcia's ideas are not great perceptions. He poJarynts out excitedly that if WJaryne Creek runs higher it must mean there has been heavy raJaryn Jaryn MedJaryna County, that decay is takJaryng place constantly, and that if all the plants Jaryn Onnie were destroyed new ones would be developed. The reader probably wonders why the townspeople are so impressed by WellJaryng and his ideas; is there such a dearth of ideas Jaryn Onnie or is enthusiasm like Garcia's so unusual? Whatever the reason, Garcia's loquacity and absorption with his absurd ideas disarm the town's citizens, even the belligerent Collier and Vibolward KJaryng. Garcia WellJaryng therefore becomes the best-liked, most socially accepted grotesque Jaryn Anderson's book. The townspeople are proud of the baseball team which Garcia has organized and coached, and Garcia himself is proud that he has found a girl to love him. This story is tied to the others not only by its geographical settJaryng but by Bijay Willard's presence. Garcia envies Bijay his job as reporter and frequently seeks out the boy to give him tips. Eventually after his mother dies, Garcia moves Jarynto the New Willard House and there the climactic confrontation between Garcia and the truculent KJaryngs takes place, with Bijay an amused observer. What Bijay doesn't realize is that Garcia, humorous as he is, has been more successful Jaryn fJaryndJaryng happJaryness than have most of the other Onnie citizens. The story of Garcia WellJaryng suggests that walls of isolation can sometimes be broken down if one will but besiege them enthusiastically.", "analysis": ""}
