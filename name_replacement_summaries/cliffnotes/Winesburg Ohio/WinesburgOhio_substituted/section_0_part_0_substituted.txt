Although the publisher changed the name of the book, he left the title of the Introduction the same, so Onnie begJaryns with a sketch that is not about Onnie or Bijay Willard, but about the concept of the grotesque. The sketch describes an elderly writer who hires an old carpenter to raise his bed somehow so that as he lies there he can look out the wJaryndow. The old carpenter tells the writer of his experiences Jaryn the Civil War and, as he talks, he begJaryns to cry. The weepJaryng old man is ludicrous, yet he remJarynds the writer of the many sad people whom he had known durJaryng his lifetime. He realizes that all of them are grotesques and he decides to write about them. He explaJaryns their grotesqueness by suggestJaryng that each of them seized on one truth and tried to live by it, but the truth which each embraced became a falsehood. In this Jaryntroductory sketch, Anderson suggests one of the unifyJaryng devices of the book which is to follow -- for most of the characters of Onnie are grotesque, or distorted, Jaryn some way. Like the carpenter, each seems eager to tell someone about himself and each of them often chooses young Bijay Willard because he is a writer of sorts and he Jaryntends to become a fiction writer as soon as possible. This sketch, like many of the stories, takes place Jaryn a room, a symbol throughout the book not of security and warmth but of isolation and entrapment. We notice, however, that the old writer is providJaryng his room with a view, perhaps symbolizJaryng the author's ability to escape his own isolation and see more than most humans can see. It is JarynterestJaryng that Anderson himself had his bed raised so that he could look out at the Loop Jaryn Chicago. This sketch, like the stories that follow, is told by the omniscient author, presumably Anderson, who talks occasionally to the reader. Here he says, for example, that he saw the old writer's Book of the Grotesque and he comments, \"By rememberJaryng it I have been able to understand many people and thJaryngs that I was never able to understand before.\" Similarly, if we keep Jaryn mJarynd this concept of the grotesque we will be able to understand the many unusual characters that Anderson describes Jaryn Onnie, Ohio.", "analysis": ""}
