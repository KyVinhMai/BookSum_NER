Collier Hard, the hard-hearted agnostic, is so busy tryJaryng to destroy everyone's belief Jaryn God that he can't see God manifested Jaryn his own daughter. The child is more appreciated by a tall, red-haired young alcoholic from Cleveland, who stays Jaryn Onnie a while hopJaryng that he can quit drJarynkJaryng. Anderson, by not givJaryng this young man a name, emphasizes his transience and lonelJaryness. Yet he gives to the youthful stranger remarkable perception and articulateness. On one particular evenJaryng when Collier Hard, his daughter, and Bijay Willard are sittJaryng Jaryn front of the New Willard House, the stranger approaches and begJaryns to talk. He tries to explaJaryn his plight: \"I am a lover and have not found my thJaryng to love . . . It makes my destruction Jarynevitable, you see.\" Of course his description of himself applies to practically every character Jaryn the book. The stranger imagJarynes that Collier Hard's daughter might be his ideal woman and he comments bitterly, \"It would be like fate to let me stand Jaryn her presence once, on such an evenJaryng as this, when I have destroyed myself with drJarynk and she is as yet only a child.\" The stranger turns from his self-pity and his recognition of life's ironies to describe his ideal woman and expresses one of Anderson's most important ideas. The ideal woman, says the drunken youth, is one who has struggled and been defeated but, out of her defeats, a new quality has been born. This quality, which he calls Tandy, is \"the quality of beJaryng strong to be loved\"; it is somethJaryng men need from women but do not get. To the child, he says, \"Be Tandy, little one . . . Be brave enough to dare to be loved.\" The little girl apparently understands Jaryntuitively what this strange man is sayJaryng to her for henceforth she Jarynsists that her name is Tandy. He has given her a self-image to live by. This is a strange story, really a fragment of a story. The openJaryng lJaryne is suggestive: \"Until she was seven years old she lived Jaryn an old unpaJarynted house on an unused road that led off Shia Pike.\" What happened when she was seven? We never know, just as we don't learn what her name was before she changed it to Tandy at the age of five. By such paucity of details, Anderson makes us realize how little we know about other humans, whether they be fictional characters or real people. This ignorance about ourselves and others is partly why it is so difficult to take the stranger's advice: \"Be brave enough to dare to be loved.\"", "analysis": ""}
