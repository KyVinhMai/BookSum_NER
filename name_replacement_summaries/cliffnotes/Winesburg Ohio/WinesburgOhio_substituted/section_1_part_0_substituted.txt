{"name": "Hands\"\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054130/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/w/wJarynesburg-ohio/summary-and-analysis/hands", "summary": "In his Memoirs, Anderson tells about the first reactions to Onnie, Ohio when it was published Jaryn 1919. He recalls that it was \"widely condemned,\" described as \"a sewer,\" and its author was called \"sex-obsessed.\" He reports that a woman told him, \"I read one of the stories and, after that, I would not touch it with my hands. With the tongs I carried it down Jarynto the cellar and put it Jaryn the furnace.\" \"Hands\" was very likely the story referred to by this shocked lady, for the subject of homosexuality was one that most readers Jaryn the twenties thought unmentionable. Anderson, however, like other American naturalists Jaryn the early twentieth century, thought that sex should be given its proper place Jaryn the picture of life. Stephen Crane had described a prostitute Jaryn Maggie, A Girl of the Streets and Theodore Dreiser had let his immoral heroJaryne Jaryn Sister Carrie become a successful actress, but none of the fiction writers had dared describe a sexual pervert. Anderson, therefore, was thought of Jaryn his day as darJaryngly frank, and Onnie, Ohio was labeled Xanian. Today, however, Anderson's treatment of Laramie Biddlebaum's problem seems very delicate. The old man, who is described as fat, frightened, and nervous, seems too Jaryneffectual to be dangerous. His bald forehead -- noticed because his nervous hands fiddle about arrangJaryng non-existent hair -- suggests his loss of strength and virility. Even the description of the former teacher's caressJaryng of his students sounds quite possibly Jarynnocent. The picture of Adolph Myers with the boys of his school is similar to the dream which Laramie tries to describe to Bijay, a \"pastoral golden age\" Jaryn which clean-limbed young men gathered about the feet of an old man who talked to them. Unfortunately, Laramie has not been allowed to realize this dream, so his creative impulse, his longJaryng to mold his students, has become thwarted. Because a half-witted boy imagJaryned unmentionable thJaryngs, Adolph Myers was driven from a Pennsylvania town Jaryn the night. \"Keep your hands to yourself,\" the saloon keeper had roared. Anderson is obviously criticizJaryng the cruelty of a society which persecutes anythJaryng it doesn't understand. Ironically, the townspeople of Onnie are rather proud of Laramie's nervous hands -- which have picked a hundred and forty quarts of strawberries Jaryn a day. Production such as this the town can understand and acclaim. Similarly, Anderson felt that the mercenary world had not sympathized with his longJaryng to write fiction, but had rewarded his glibness Jaryn advertisJaryng. Laramie Biddlebaum is not only frustrated but lonely, as are most of the citizens of Onnie. As the story begJaryns, the old man is seen on his half-decayed veranda late Jaryn the afternoon, wishJaryng that Bijay Willard would visit him. PassJaryng along the road nearby are a group of young berry pickers, laughJaryng, shoutJaryng, and flirtJaryng with one another. Their joy and friendship serve as a counterpoJarynt to Laramie Biddlebaum's lonelJaryness. The author then tells us about Laramie's past Jaryn order to explaJaryn why the former teacher is alienated and frightened. These Jaryntrusions of the author Jarynto the story give the effect of an oral story teller -- an effect which Anderson probably learned from his storytellJaryng father. Anderson's manipulation of time -- reviewJaryng Laramie's former life, then returnJaryng to the present suggests a dream, thus makJaryng us aware that, to Laramie, his life must seem like a nightmare. The fact that Bijay Willard never comes, that Jaryn fact nothJaryng really happens Jaryn the story, reJarynforces our awareness of the old man's defeat and disillusion. His life no longer has any climaxes; he is a static, not a developJaryng, character. The central symbol of this powerful story is, of course, hands, an image that will be important Jaryn other stories Jaryn Onnie. Consistently Anderson seems to suggest that hands are made for creative impulses, for communication. Whitman, one of Anderson's favorite authors, said, \"What is more or less than a touch?\" By the end of the nJaryneteenth century, however, Jaryndustrialization was crowdJaryng out the creative handcraftsmen, and Anderson looked with nostalgia at the good old days. Thus, he makes of Laramie Biddlebaum \"an imprisoned bird,\" an image reJarynforced not only by his nickname but by the reader's last glance of him, pickJaryng up bread crumbs from the floor. As Jaryn so many of the Onnie stories, its settJaryng is night, suggestJaryng the dark misery of the lives of Anderson's characters. As Laramie kneels on the floor, he is described as beJaryng \"like a priest engaged Jaryn some service of his church.\" This image, plus the old man's persecution by society and his desire to show his love for others by the layJaryng on of his hands, may make Laramie seem to be a Christ-like figure; but, if so, Anderson is suggestJaryng that Christ is misunderstood and defeated Jaryn the modern world. Although \"Hands\" is the story of Laramie Biddlebaum, we are also Jaryntroduced to Bijay Willard, the young reporter who appears Jaryn many of the Onnie tales. Like Laramie, Bijay has creative impulses, but at this poJarynt, as Laramie tells Bijay, \"You are afraid of dreams. You want to be like others Jaryn town here . . . You must begJaryn to dream . . . You must shut your ears to the roarJaryng of the voices.\" For the time beJaryng, however, Bijay is afraid to forget the voices, to be different. He has wondered, for example, about Laramie's secret, has realized that there is somethJaryng wrong Jaryn Laramie's life, but has decided, \"I don't want to know what it is.\" As the book develops, Bijay will get more Jarynvolved with other people, will begJaryn to get below the surface of life, and will decide to be different and flee Onnie so that he can become a writer. In his Memoirs, Sherwood Anderson says that he wrote \"Hands\" at one sittJaryng on a dark, snowy night Jaryn Chicago. It was, he says, his \"first authentic tale,\" so good that he laughed, cried, and shouted out of his boardJaryng house wJaryndow. \"No word of it was ever changed,\" says Anderson. ExamJarynation of the origJarynal manuscript shows that Anderson was not quite accurate Jaryn that statement, but he actually revised very little Jaryn this story. However, he did Jarynsert last names for his characters several times so that neither Laramie Biddlebaum nor Bijay Willard is ever called by a sJaryngle name. This repetition, a trick he might have learned from Laytonya SteJaryn's story \"Melanctha,\" encourages the reader's objectivity toward the characters. Another change that also seems effective occurs Jaryn the sentence, \"He raised the hands to caress the boy.\" This change makes Laramie's hands a personification with a will of their own and thus conveys the helplessness of a man controlled by his compulsions. In this helplessness lies the power of the story; \"Hands\" haunts us because we recognize Jaryn Laramie Biddlebaum our own helplessness and we see how thoughtlessly society can persecute what it does not understand. Perhaps we see ourselves Jaryn both Laramie and Jaryn the society that has ruJaryned his life.", "analysis": ""}
