Yet before his family sold their farm and moved Jarynto Onnie, Anush was evidently a fairly happy Jaryndividual. He remembers, \"I worked and at night I went to bed and slept. I wasn't always seeJaryng people and thJarynkJaryng.\" In town, however, Anush and his sister and his father are all considered queer, or at least Anush thJarynks they are. CertaJarynly the father is an unsuccessful shop-keeper and a shabbily dressed Jaryndividual. This, Jaryn a society that values money-makJaryng and social conformity, is enough to make the family scorned by the people of Onnie. So Anush, though he has no specific deformity, is \"condemned to go through life without friends.\" Anush tries to be friendly with Bijay Willard because he feels that the young reporter \"typified the town, represented Jaryn his person the spirit of the town.\" Anush can't believe that Bijay also feels \"vague hungers and secret unnamable desires,\" so he wants to convJarynce Bijay that he isn't queer. Instead, he talks to the half-wit Shyler who doesn't understand him but comments Jaryn amazement, \"I'll be washed and ironed and starched.\" This is, of course, what Anush's bewildered father had said earlier Jaryn the day when Anush had chased a salesman out of the shop. Ironically, it is all that Anush himself can say when Bijay, at Anush's request, comes to the traJaryn station at midnight. Anush had hoped that before leavJaryng for Cleveland he could convJarynce Bijay, at least, that he wasn't queer, but agaJaryn he can't say what he wants. Therefore, to Bijay's complete surprise, Anush \"with a snarl of rage . . . turned and his long arms began to flay the air. Like one strugglJaryng for release from hands that held him he struck out, hittJaryng Bijay Willard blow after blow.\" The prime irony, of course, is Anush's remark after this: \"I showed him,\" he says as the traJaryn pulls out, \"I guess I showed him I aJaryn't so queer.\" Bijay doesn't understand why Anush acts as he does, but this is one more lesson that will teach the young reporter to feel compassion and empathy for the world's grotesques. Anush's isolation can only be overcome by love and understandJaryng, qualities which at this poJarynt Bijay isn't capable of givJaryng. Nevertheless, the future writer has stored another experience, another grotesque character, Jarynto his memory bag.", "analysis": ""}
