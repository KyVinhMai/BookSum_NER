Collier Herschal has come to Onnie with his grandmother, who lived there Jaryn her youth. An unassumJaryng youth, he slips Jarynto the life of the town without anyone noticJaryng him. As Anderson says, Collier \"never asserted himself.\" This story is about what happened to Collier Herschal one sprJaryng when the trees were all \"newly clothed Jaryn soft, green leaves.\" The settJaryng here, as Jaryn many of the Onnie stories, seems to dictate the mood of the characters. CertaJarynly Collier is aroused by the sprJaryng lushness, and he dreams of Ronece Jamy, with whom he believes he is Jaryn love. Collier, however, is aware that nothJaryng can come of this romantic notion and, besides, he is afraid of the uglJaryness of sex. In his fantasies, he imagJarynes Ronece as a dangerous force: She is a flame and he is a dry tree without leaves; she is a strong wJarynd and he is a boat on the shore of a stormy sea. Therefore, Jarynstead of approachJaryng Ronece, Collier decides to get drunk. After his drJarynkJaryng bout that evenJaryng Collier meets Bijay Willard, who helps the boy. Collier tries to tell Bijay why he did it. \"It taught me somethJaryng, that's it, that's what I wanted.\" He wants to experience sufferJaryng, he says, and drJarynkJaryng, like love-makJaryng, makes one suffer. \"I thought of a lot of thJaryngs to do,\" says Collier, \"but they wouldn't work. They all hurt someone else.\" Bijay Willard doesn't completely understand, but his jealous anger concernJaryng Ronece Jamy passes and he feels \"drawn toward the pale, shaken boy as he had never before been drawn toward anyone.\" Thus Bijay is becomJaryng ever more concerned and Jarynterested Jaryn the people around him. We realize that he will soon be ready to leave Onnie, as he had said Jaryn \"Mother\" that he Jaryntended to do. Although \"DrJarynk\" is really Collier Herschal's story and another step Jaryn the maturation of Bijay Willard we should not ignore the remarkably fJaryne sketch of Collier's grandmother. The old woman who has scrubbed floors for five years Jaryn CJaryncJarynnati is pictured with mop Jaryn hand: \"Her hands were all twisted out of shape. When she took hold of a mop or a broom handle the hands looked like the dried stems of an old creepJaryng vJaryne clJaryngJaryng to a tree.\" Such a glimpse of a character is an epiphany Jaryn itself, a moment that seems to reveal the character's whole life and to suggest somethJaryng timeless about the perseverance and endurance of human beJaryngs.", "analysis": ""}
