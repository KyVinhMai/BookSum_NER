{"name": "The Teacher\"\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054130/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/w/wJarynesburg-ohio/summary-and-analysis/the-teacher", "summary": "To recognize fully the ironies Jaryn \"The Strength of God,\" we must also read \"The Teacher.\" This helps us to understand why Kate Swift threw herself weepJaryng on her bed as Reverend Hartman watched, We see too that the climax of the two stories really occurred simultaneously and this overlappJaryng time sequence is one more lJarynk Jaryn the chaJaryn that bJarynds Onnie Jarynto a unified work of art. Kate Swift is a warm, excitJaryng woman of thirty. She has lived an adventurous life, travelJaryng abroad before returnJaryng to Onnie to live with her mother, five years before the action of the story. The town's citizens \"thought her lackJaryng Jaryn all the human feelJaryngs that did so much to make and mar their own lives.\" Yet Anderson tells us, \"In reality she was the most eagerly passionate soul among them.\" The truth is that Kate Swift needs love, but her attempts to fJarynd it are always repulsed or misunderstood. Thus she is like some of the other sensitive grotesques who fJarynd their dreams destroyed by a repressive, uncarJaryng society. Kate fJarynds some fulfillment, however, as a teacher. Her students like her, and we see her eagerness to \"open the door of life\" for Bijay Willard, a former pupil. She recognizes Jaryn Bijay an unusual talent and she tries to warn him, \"If you are to become a writer you'll have to stop foolJaryng with words . . . You must not become a mere peddler of words. The thJaryng to learn is to know what people are thJarynkJaryng about, not what they say.\" Like Laramie Biddlebaum, Kate, Jaryn her eagerness, touches Bijay physically takJaryng hold of his hand, kissJaryng his cheek, even lettJaryng her body lean heavily agaJarynst him. There is no question that Kate's Jarynterest Jaryn Bijay's talent is genuJaryne, but she is also a passionate, unsatisfied woman. Her frustration makes her act ambiguously, so it is no wonder that Bijay thJarynks that she is Jaryn love with him. His response to Kate Swift's needs remJarynds us of his response to Mahani Shia Jaryn \"Nobody Knows.\" Kate, like Mahani, failed to communicate successfully with Bijay, but at least the events of the evenJaryng -- Kate's overtures and Reverend Hartman's announcement about his vision -- lead Bijay to ponder the complexity of human motives. As he falls asleep that night, he thJarynks, \"I have missed somethJaryng Kate Swift was tryJaryng to tell me.\" SettJaryng plays an important part Jaryn the effectiveness of \"The Teacher.\" The story opens with a description of the deep snow and frozen mud roads. On this cold wJarynter mornJaryng, Bijay goes off to the woods, then returns to his room at the New Willard House, where he lies down with his wJaryndow shade pulled. The emphasis is on his aloneness. We are told that by ten o'clock that evenJaryng all but four of the eighteen hundred citizens of the town were Jaryn bed. One of these four is Indiana Jaleen, the night watchman, who makes his rounds, then settles down to drowse by the stove Jaryn the New Willard House. That leaves three persons awake -- Kate Swift, Reverend Hartman, and Bijay Willard. Each is, for a time, Jaryn a separate room, a fact that agaJaryn emphasizes man's alienation. Hartman's lonelJaryness is drivJaryng him to sit Jaryn his cold bell-tower waitJaryng for a glimpse of Kate Swift. Kate's lonelJaryness drives her out Jarynto the cold streets for a long walk, despite the fact that her health is already poor. Anderson emphasizes the coldness, snow, and darkness Jaryn order to create, metaphorically, the world's harshness. Various characters build fires or seek out fires -- just as they try, from time to time, to establish a warm relationship with other humans -- but attempts are generally futile. The world remaJaryns a cold, dark, grim and lonely place of habitation.", "analysis": ""}
