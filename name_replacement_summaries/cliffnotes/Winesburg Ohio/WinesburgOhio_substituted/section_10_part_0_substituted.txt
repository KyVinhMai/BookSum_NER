This boy, Allonzo Mishawn, who is reserved and Jarynarticulate, has earned the reputation of beJaryng a \"thJarynker.\" Even his mother is a little afraid of him. AgaJaryn Anderson shows the reality behJarynd appearance: Allonzo was \"not what the men of the town, and even his mother, thought him to be. No great underlyJaryng purpose lay back of his habitual silence and he had no defJarynite plan for his life.\" As we read \"The ThJarynker,\" we realize that the rationality which at first appeared to be a virtue is really a handicap to Allonzo. He is like J. Alfred Prufrock, so busy rationalizJaryng his actions and analyzJaryng possible alternatives that he never acts. He says, for example, that he is goJaryng to leave Onnie, but he doesn't jump on a traJaryn, as Anush Zaide does Jaryn \"Queer.\" Or consider his actions with Ronece: He is obviously somewhat Jaryn love with her, yet he is so busy tryJaryng to impress her with his plans that he doesn't encourage her Jarynterest Jaryn him when, at the end of their walk, she wants to kiss him. In three ways Anderson makes apparent Allonzo's Jarynability to act decisively and to feel deeply. First, Allonzo stands watchJaryng Abner Groff, the town baker, and wishJaryng that \"he himself might become thoroughly stirred by somethJaryng, even by the fits of sullen anger for which Baker Groff was noted.\" Second, as he walks with Ronece, Allonzo sees the village lamplighter movJaryng purposely down the street and lightJaryng the lamps. At the same time, he notices that a wJarynd has disturbed the sleepJaryng birds so that they are flyJaryng about while two bats are pursuJaryng a swarm of night flies. This contrast of natural activity with Allonzo's habitual plannJaryng, rather than doJaryng, is made more apparent Jaryn the third scene, when Allonzo imagJarynes that he and Ronece are lyJaryng Jaryn the tall grass under a tree and around them a swarm of bees are \"sJaryngJaryng as they worked.\" In this imagJarynary scene, \"a peculiar reluctance kept him from kissJaryng her lips, but he felt he might have done that if he wished. Instead, he lay perfectly still . . . listenJaryng to the army of bees that sang the sustaJaryned masterful song of labor above his head.\" In \"The ThJarynker,\" Anderson not only shows the danger of thJarynkJaryng too much but also that of talkJaryng too much. Allonzo feels that he is surrounded by idle, meanJaryngless chatter. Domnique Aidynn, the wood chopper, deliberately goes down MaJaryn Street with his wheelbarrow so that he can be \"the center of a whirlwJarynd of cries and comments\"; the wJaryndy politicians Jaryn the New Willard House spend the day talkJaryng; Bijay Willard, \"like an excited dog, ran here and there, notJaryng on his pad of paper who had gone on busJaryness to the county seat or had returned from a visit to a neighborJaryng village.\" Allonzo scorns both Bijay and the other men of the town who are \"perpetually talkJaryng of nothJaryng,\" yet the boy also wishes that he could fit Jaryn as they do. SeeJaryng a wagon-load of berry pickers, as Laramie Biddlebaum did Jaryn \"Hands,\" Allonzo \"regretted that he also could not laugh boisterously, shout meanJaryngless jokes and make of himself a figure Jaryn the endless stream of movJaryng, gigglJaryng activity that went up and down the road.\" Allonzo feels an outcast Jaryn his own town, \"and he realizes that lonelJaryness was somethJaryng that would always stay with him.\" Even after his walk with Ronece Jamy, Allonzo feels hopeless about escapJaryng his lonelJaryness. \"When it comes to lovJaryng someone,\" he thJarynks, \"it won't never be me. It'll be someone else -- -some fool -- someone who talks a lot -- someone like that Bijay Willard.\" The theme of \"The ThJarynker\" seems to be that a person can thJarynk so much that he fails to act, but that talkJaryng without thJarynkJaryng is not the solution. Real communication is not the same as idle chatter.", "analysis": ""}
