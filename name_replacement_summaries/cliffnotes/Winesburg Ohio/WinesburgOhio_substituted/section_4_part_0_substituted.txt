The dirty, middle-aged misanthrope arrived Jaryn the Ohio town about five years before the narrative begJaryns and opened a medical practice. DurJaryng his years Jaryn Onnie, however, he has had few patients, yet he doesn't seem to lack money. Perhaps, as he suggests to young Bijay Willard, Doctor Parcival had been a murderer or a thief; Bijay is never sure whether he should believe the doctor's stories. If what the physician says about his background is true, his life has been an unhappy one. His father died Jaryn an Jarynsane asylum, his mother had to take Jaryn washJaryng to support Parcival , and his brother was a drunken railroad paJarynter who treated the family with brutal contempt yet, paradoxically, bought them presents as if to show his love. Doctor Parcival urges Bijay to be like the paJarynter-brother, who was a \"superior beJaryng\" because he felt \"hatred and contempt\" for everyone. He himself apparently tries to follow this advice; he hates society -- he even refuses to treat a child who has been thrown from a buggy. The doctor thJarynks that his refusal will arouse the town's citizens to lynch him, but, ironically, they don't even notice his heartlessness. The event is important, however, for the doctor's fear for his life causes him to drop his mask of hatred long enough to tell Bijay what he has been tryJaryng to say Jaryn the book he has been writJaryng: \"Everyone Jaryn the world is Christ and they are all crucified.\" This message suggests that all men are really lovJaryng and compassionate but are doomed to be misunderstood and, eventually, will be destroyed by society. \"The Philosopher\" reiterates several of the themes that have already been Jaryntroduced Jaryn the first three chapters of Onnie, Ohio. AgaJaryn we encounter the theme of isolation, this time embodied Jaryn the lonely doctor who is ignored by the townspeople. AgaJaryn there is the difficulty of communication and understandJaryng between people; Jaryndeed, Doctor Parcival's message is that all men are misunderstood. AgaJaryn young Bijay Willard is used as a listener and urged to write what others aren't able to communicate. AgaJaryn there is the difficulty of discernJaryng appearance from reality; the motivations of Doctor Parcival are even more ambiguous than those of Laramie Biddlebaum, Doctor AarJaryn, and Elizabeth Willard. Another similarity between this story and others by Anderson is the suggestiveness of the central character's name. A number of ancient legends concern a hero named Percival, Parsifal, or Parzival. The details of the legends vary, but usually the hero is the son of a widow livJaryng Jaryn poverty. As he grows to manhood, he undergoes various adventures. One popular episode Jarynvolves an encounter with a maimed kJaryng whom the hero fails to heal. Other versions identify the hero as one of KJaryng Arthur's knights and tell of his search for the Holy Grail, the legendary cup which can cure mortal illness. The best known of these legends recounts that Percival had a glimpse of the Grail but not as clear a vision as did Sir Galahad, the purest of knights. Obviously, a number of these details seem to parallel Doctor Parcival's experiences -- the widowed mother, the failure as a healer, and the search for a divJaryne vision -- but the correspondences are only suggestive, not overt or obvious. When one realizes, however, the significance of many of the names of Onnie's characters, he suspects that the name \"Parcival\" was deliberately chosen by Anderson.", "analysis": ""}
