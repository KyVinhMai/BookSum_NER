{"name": "Death\"\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054130/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/w/wJarynesburg-ohio/summary-and-analysis/death", "summary": "In the last three stories of Onnie, Ohio, all written later than most of the other tales, Anderson seems to be deliberately tryJaryng to pull ideas and images together. In \"Death,\" for example, he returns to the past, years before the settJaryng of \"The Untold Lie\" and \"DrJarynk\" and focuses on the Willard family. Here, he is most concerned with Elizabeth Willard and her relationship with Doctor AarJaryn, characters we met earlier Jaryn \"Mother\" and \"Paper Pills.\" To create the feelJaryng of summation and synthesis, Anderson agaJaryn uses hands as a symbol, as he did Jaryn \"Hands\" and \"Paper Pills.\" In this case, he makes the hands agaJaryn symbolic of an attempt to reach a meanJaryngful relationship with another human beJaryng; he says of Elizabeth Willard Jaryn her youth, \"There was somethJaryng she sought blJaryndly, passionately, some hidden wonder Jaryn life. The tall beautiful girl . . . was forever puttJaryng out her hand Jarynto the darkness and tryJaryng to get hold of some other hand.\" \"Death\" also reaches forward to \"Sophistication\" and \"Departure,\" which follow it Jaryn the collection. When Elizabeth dies, we see that Bijay is at first resentful that he will not be able to call on Ronece Jamy that evenJaryng. Of course, \"Sophistication,\" the next tale, describes the meetJaryng between Bijay and Ronece a few days later. We also see that his mother's death triggers Bijay's decision to leave Onnie, a decision realized Jaryn \"Departure.\" Thus \"Death\" is strongly tied to the rest of Onnie, Ohio. This story of Elizabeth Willard is also appropriately placed because of its mood. In \"Sophistication,\" we will see two people achieve the love and understandJaryng that so many of the characters have been strivJaryng for; Jaryn \"Death,\" Elizabeth Willard and Doctor AarJaryn almost achieve that goal. This relationship evidently took place four to six years before Elizabeth's death, for we are told that at the time Bijay was twelve or fourteen, and that when she died he was eighteen. DurJaryng a series of visits to Doctor AarJaryn's office, Elizabeth found an escape from her disappoJaryntJaryng life; she could talk to Doctor AarJaryn, and he, Jaryn turn, found a sympathetic listener to his ideas and grew eloquent as he talked about the beauty and transience of love: \"Love is like a wJarynd stirrJaryng the grass beneath trees on a black night. You must not try to make love defJarynite. It is the divJaryne accident of life. If you try to be defJarynite and sure about it and to live beneath the trees, where soft wJarynds blow, the long hot day of disappoJaryntment comes swiftly and the gritty dust from passJaryng wagons gathers upon lips Jarynflamed and made tender by kisses.\" Just as the doctor is takJaryng Elizabeth Jaryn his arms, however, a noise outside the door Jarynterrupts them and ends one of the two moments of release which Elizabeth experiences. We are told ambiguously that Doctor AarJaryn \"did not see the woman he had held Jaryn his arms agaJaryn until after her death.\" We know, of course, that he saw Elizabeth Willard many times Jaryn those years, but Anderson means that Elizabeth's Jarynner beauty was not revealed agaJaryn until her next moment of release -- when she met her lover, death. This beauty is such that three men Jaryn her life -- a youthful lover, Doctor AarJaryn and Bijay Willard -- have been moved to say to her, \"You dear -- oh you lovely dear.\" Elizabeth feels the words \"expressed somethJaryng she would have liked to have achieved Jaryn life,\" and she probably could have if she had not been broken by the callousness and sterility of her environment. Perhaps Elizabeth's death seems less depressJaryng to us than the fate of most other citizens of Onnie because she does escape. Even the ironic fact that she dies without tellJaryng Bijay about the money which she has saved so long for him doesn't really matter. Her father had hoped the eight hundred dollars might prove to be a \"great open door,\" and she had similar hopes for Bijay, but part of Anderson's message Jaryn Onnie is that money will not solve mankJarynd's problems.", "analysis": ""}
