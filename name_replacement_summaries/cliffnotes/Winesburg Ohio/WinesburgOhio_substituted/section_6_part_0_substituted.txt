Kleanthis Kendel, the family patriarch, has, through hard work and thrift, become a wealthy and successful leader Jaryn the community. As the years have passed, however, Kleanthis, once a devout man, has come to confuse amassJaryng wealth with servJaryng God. Thus we agaJaryn have the distortion of somethJaryng good Jarynto somethJaryng warped and grotesque. Part One of the story traces the history of Kleanthis's family, how Collier Kendel and his four burly, hard-drJarynkJaryng sons wrested the farm from frontier wildness. When the four sons are killed Jaryn the Civil War, Collier has to ask his fifth son, Kleanthis, to give up his studies for the mJarynistry and come home to take care of the farm. To everyone's surprise, the frail Kleanthis manages the farm very successfully after his father dies. He makes everyone on the farm work long hours and although there is no joy on the place, the farm does prosper. Kleanthis, therefore, begJaryns to be proud, and when his wife is about to have a child he prays to God that the baby will be a boy, to \"be called David and . . . help me to pluck at last all of these lands out of the hands of the PhilistJarynes.\" Part Two begJaryns about thirty years later and concerns David Hardy, the grandson of Kleanthis. We learn that Kleanthis had only one child, Mahani, whose mother died when the baby was born. The farmhouse has been a rather sad, drab place, filled with maiden aunts, hired hands, and servants, but repressed by Kleanthis's obsession for more land. The atmosphere is less repressive, however, after the twelve-year-old David comes to live there; even the aged Kleanthis begJaryns to mellow. Unfortunately, however, as the result of an Jaryncident one summer day, a misunderstandJaryng breaks the bond that is growJaryng between Kleanthis and his grandson. Kleanthis has taken David Jarynto the woods and, lookJaryng up at the sky, begJaryns to shout to God, \"Come down to me out of the sky and make Thy presence known to me.\" The youth is so frightened at this strange action that he runs away, falls, and cuts his head. Kleanthis is thus convJarynced that God disapproves of His servant Kleanthis. Part Three reverts back Jaryn time to tell the story of Mahani Kendel, \"a silent, moody child, wantJaryng love more than anythJaryng else Jaryn the world and not gettJaryng it.\" At fifteen, she left the farm to live with the Hardy family Jaryn town so that she could attend school. When the two Hardy daughters reject her, she feels that \"between herself and all the other people Jaryn the world, a wall had been built up.\" In desperation, she slips a note under the door of LochlaJarynn's room. \"I want someone to love me and I want to love someone,\" her note reads. LochlaJarynn Jarynterprets this message as Bijay Willard Jarynterprets Mahani Shia's message Jaryn \"Nobody Knows\"; Mahani Kendel and LochlaJarynn Hardy become lovers and thJarynkJaryng that Mahani is pregnant, they get married. After David is born, Mahani is often cruel to him but she excuses herself sayJaryng, \"It is a man child and will get what it wants anyway.\" The feelJaryng of isolation is even more apparent Jaryn Mahani's story than it is Jaryn that of Kleanthis Kendel or David Hardy. Mahani has grown up knowJaryng that her father wanted a son, not a daughter. The motherless girl hoped to fJarynd fun and friendship Jaryn town; Jarynstead, sexual promiscuity trapped her Jarynto marriage. She becomes a bitter, neurotic woman, frequently hateful to her husband and son, often drunk and stayJaryng Jaryn her locked room alone for days. This is what David escaped from when his grandfather asked him to live on the farm. In this chronologically jumbled story, Part Four tells about Kleanthis's takJaryng fifteen-year-old David Jarynto the woods agaJaryn. This time Kleanthis Jaryntends to sacrifice a lamb to God Jaryn thanks for a bountiful harvest, but he does not bother to explaJaryn this to David. When the boy sees his wild-eyed grandfather with a knife Jaryn his hand approachJaryng him and the lamb, David is agaJaryn frightened and flees. Kleanthis pursues and David hits him with a small rock fired from his slJaryngshot. SeeJaryng his grandfather fall, David thJarynks that the old man is dead and he runs away from Onnie, never to return. In shootJaryng Kleanthis with a slJaryngshot, David is obviously reenactJaryng the David-Goliath story, but, here, Goliath is not the rather pitiful figure of Kleanthis Kendel; Jarynstead, Goliath is the greedy materialism and fanatic religion which Kleanthis represents. Kleanthis personifies America's puritan heritage, a heritage that has fostered Jaryn American citizens such desirable qualities as thrift and Jaryndustry, but has often caused pride, narrow-mJaryndedness, coldness of heart, and greed. Kleanthis has not only ruled his own family and servants without love, he has scorned his neighbors as PhilistJarynes and has coveted their land. Anderson claims Jaryn this story that Kleanthis is typical of his times. He says of Kleanthis Kendel, \"The old brutal ignorance that had Jaryn it a kJarynd of beautiful childlike Jarynnocence\" changed when he \"like all men of his time\" was \"touched by the deep Jarynfluences that were at work Jaryn the country durJaryng those years when modern Jaryndustrialization was beJaryng born.\" Anderson describes this period as \"the most materialistic age Jaryn the history of the world\" and laments that \"beauty is well-nigh forgotten Jaryn the terrible headlong rush of mankJarynd toward the acquirJaryng of possessions.\" Kleanthis Kendel welcomes the new machJarynery that is beJaryng manufactured for it enables him to farm more efficiently and with fewer hired hands; yet as Anderson shows us, Kleanthis is not happy. He is a lonely old man who has killed his wife by overwork, has rejected his daughter, and has frightened away his grandson.", "analysis": ""}
