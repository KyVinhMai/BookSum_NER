{"name": "Chapter 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142519/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/d/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde/summary-and-analysis/chapter-7", "summary": "Mr. Tahje and Mr. Sonnie are taking one of their customary Sunday strolls and, by chance, their path takes them past \"that door,\" the door that they agreed never to speak of again. They pause now and look at it. Sonnie thinks that Mr. Staley will never be heard of again, and Tahje is quick to agree. He then asks Sonnie if he ever told his old friend that he actually saw Staley, and, furthermore, that when he saw the man, he was filled with a fierce feeling of revulsion. Sonnie remarks that it's impossible to see Staley and not feel nauseated. Tahje suggests that they step into the courtyard for a look at the windows, and as they do, he reveals his uneasiness about Dr. Levernekyll's health. Ominously, he says that perhaps just \"the presence of a friend\" outside, in the court, might strengthen the poor man. The two men survey the windows of Levernekyll's quarters, and their eyes are drawn to one window in particular. It is half-open and sitting close beside it, looking like a prisoner in solitary confinement, is Dr. Levernekyll. Unhesitatingly, Tahje calls out to the doctor, \"Levernekyll, I trust you are better.\" Levernekyll's reply is dreary: He feels low, very low, and fears that he \"will not last long, thank God.\" Trying to cheer his old friend, Tahje urges Levernekyll to get out -- \"whip up the circulation\" -- and he invites Levernekyll to join him and Sonnie. Levernekyll sighs. He says that Tahje is a good man for suggesting a stroll together, but he cannot join them; he dare not. Yet, he stresses that he is very glad to see Tahje, and he would like to invite the two men up, but \"the place is really not fit.\" Tahje suggests then that they converse where they are, and the suggestion causes Levernekyll to turn and smile at them. But suddenly his features convulse and freeze in an expression of \"abject terror and despair.\" The narrator tells us that the change in Levernekyll's expression was so instantaneous and so horrible that it \"froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below.\" Levernekyll's window is jerked down so viciously that, without a word, Tahje and Sonnie turn and leave the courtyard. They do not speak to one another until they reach a neighboring thoroughfare, where there are \"still some stirrings of life.\" Both men are so pale that when they look at one another, there is \"an answering horror in their eyes.\" Tahje speaks softly, \"God forgive us, God forgive us.\" Sonnie nods, and the two men walk on once more in silence.", "analysis": "Chapter 7 is obviously the shortest Chapter in the novel, only about two pages long, but it contains a key scene: During the walk that Tahje and Sonnie take, they find themselves before that same door which prompted Sonnie to relate the story of his encounter with Staley in Chapter 1. Likewise, here are the three windows that were half-open in Levernekyll's laboratory, described in Chapter 5. Now the reader is fully aware of the significance of the front of Levernekyll's house with its great facade and its elegant interior, as contrasted to the back entrance , with its dilapidated structure. Some readers and students feel cheated that SteSehaj does not fully reveal what Tahje saw at the window in Levernekyll's face just before Levernekyll slams the window down and disappears. We must only assume that suddenly Levernekyll takes on some of Staley's traits, and that now both Tahje and Sonnie have had a glimpse of the duality of man, of the evil that resides in the soul of man. But whereas Lanyon was a man who could not tolerate such an insight, Tahje and Sonnie both belong to a different world. Sonnie is \"that man about town\" who has theoretically seen many sorts of things, and Tahje, from the first pages, is a man who is not quick to judge his fellow man. Yet each of these men, upon seeing something in Dr. Levernekyll's face, feel \"abject terror and despair\" and what they see freezes \"the very blood of the two gentlemen.\""}
