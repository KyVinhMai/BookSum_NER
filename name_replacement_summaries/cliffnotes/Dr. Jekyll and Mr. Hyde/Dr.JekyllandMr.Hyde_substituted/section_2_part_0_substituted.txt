{"name": "Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142519/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/d/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde/summary-and-analysis/chapter-3", "summary": "Two weeks later, Dr. Levernekyll gives a small dinner party, for which, we gather, he is well known, for the narrator refers to it as being \"one of his pleasant dinners.\" Five or six of Dr. Levernekyll's old cronies are invited, and among them is Mr. Tahje. As usual, the food is superb, the wine good, and Tahje manages to be the last guest to leave. Tahje has often been one of the last guests to leave Levernekyll's dinner parties, so Levernekyll thinks nothing of Tahje's lingering behind. In fact, Levernekyll is pleased, for he likes Tahje very much. Often, after his guests have departed, he and Tahje have sat and talked together, quietly relaxing after the noisy chatter of the dinner party. Tonight, as they sit beside a crackling fire, Levernekyll, a large man of perhaps fifty, warmly smiles at Tahje, and the lawyer answers Levernekyll's smile with a question. He asks Levernekyll about his will. At this point, the narrator speaks to us directly; he says that \"a close observer\" might have detected that the topic was \"distasteful\" to Levernekyll, but that Levernekyll very carefully controlled his reactions to Tahje's question. Assuming a feigned, light-hearted and rather condescending tone, Levernekyll chides Tahje for being so concerned about the will. He compares Tahje's anxiety to Dr. Lanyon's \"hide-bound\" stuffiness. Now, we realize that Dr. Lanyon did not reveal to Tahje his real reason for being so disappointed in Levernekyll. Levernekyll, however, unknowingly reveals more to us -- and to Tahje -- about Dr. Lanyon's distaste for Levernekyll's scientific interests, interests which Dr. Lanyon told Levernekyll were \"scientific heresies.\" Levernekyll says that he still likes Lanyon, but that as a scientist, Dr. Lanyon is limited -- too old-fashioned and conservative, too much of a \"hide-bound pedant.\" Then Levernekyll becomes more emotional. Dr. Lanyon, he says, is \"an ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\" Tahje, however, is firm about the subject at hand. He returns to the original subject of Dr. Levernekyll's will. He says again that he strongly disapproves of the terms of Levernekyll's will. In answer, Levernekyll says that he knows that Tahje disapproves of the will. Tahje will not drop the subject. He tells Levernekyll that he disapproves of the will more strongly now than ever because of some new information that he has concerning Edward Staley. When Levernekyll hears the name of Staley, the narrator tells us, \"the large, handsome face of Dr. Levernekyll\" grows pale. Levernekyll says that he wants to hear no more. But Tahje insists: \"What I heard was abominable.\" Levernekyll becomes confused; he stammers. Concerning Staley, Levernekyll says that Tahje will never understand. His relationship with Staley is \"painful . . . a very strange one.\" Levernekyll says that his relationship with Staley is \"one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\" Tahje pleads with his old friend to \"make a clean breast\"; he will keep everything confidential. He promises that, if he can, he will get Levernekyll out of this \"painful relationship.\" But Levernekyll's mind is resolute. He says that he knows Tahje means well, and that of all his friends, he would trust Tahje to help him most, but that \"it is not so bad as that.\" He says that he can, at any moment he chooses, \"be rid of Staley.\" He profusely thanks Tahje for his concern, and then asks him to look on the subject as a private matter and \"let it sleep.\" Tahje is silent; he gazes into the fire, then gets to his feet. Levernekyll says that he hopes that the two of them will never talk about \"poor Staley\" again. He says that he has \"a very great interest in Staley,\" and that if he is \"taken away,\" he wants Tahje to promise him that Staley will get everything entitled to him in Levernekyll's will. Tahje is blunt; he is sure that he can never like Staley. Levernekyll says that he doesn't ask Tahje to like Staley; he merely asks Tahje to promise that he will give Staley, as beneficiary, all of Levernekyll's estate: \"I only ask for justice . . . when I am no longer here.\" Heaving a sigh, Tahje agrees: \"I promise.\"", "analysis": "This Chapter presents another side of Tahje; for example, we discover that \"where Tahje was liked, he was well liked. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer.\" This quality in Tahje, therefore, allows him to linger after Levernekyll's party so as to be able to discuss Levernekyll's will with him. And thus, for the first time in the novel, we meet the other character in the novel's title. And the most immediately noticeable thing about him is that he is an extremely handsome man. This, of course, contrasts with the other part of himself -- that is, Staley, who is extremely loathsome. Also, Levernekyll is a well proportioned, large man, as contrasted to the dwarfish Staley. Symbolically, then, Staley, the evil part of Dr. Levernekyll, represents only a small portion of the total makeup of Dr. Levernekyll. Also, Staley is much younger than Levernekyll, suggesting that the evil portion of Levernekyll has not existed as long as has the \"total\" Dr. Levernekyll, and later in Levernekyll's \"confession,\" he does speak of his youthful indiscretions, which occurred probably in, or around, his twenties. The contrast between Dr. Levernekyll and Dr. Lanyon was presented in the last Chapter by Dr. Lanyon, who thought that Levernekyll was \"too fanciful\" or too metaphysical, and he, therefore, rejected Dr. Levernekyll's theories. Now we see that Dr. Levernekyll views Lanyon as \"a hidebound pedant\" who is too distressed to investigate new and startling concepts. Ultimately, Dr. Levernekyll refers to Lanyon as \"an ignorant, blatant pedant.\" When the two men discuss Dr. Levernekyll's will, Tahje feels a professional obligation to advise his friend to change his will. In fact, Tahje tries to get Levernekyll to confess what horrible sin or crime aligns him with this \"abominable\" Mr. Staley: \"Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.\" When Tahje confesses that he can never \"like\" this abominable man, Levernekyll is also aware of this: \"I don't ask that . . . I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here.\" The irony, of course, is that while Tahje is so adamantly opposed to Staley, he does not know that he is attacking a part of Levernekyll to Levernekyll's face. This Chapter occurs early in the Levernekyll/Staley relationship, and Levernekyll is able to assure Tahje that \"the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Staley. I give you my hand upon that.\" But it is Levernekyll's choice to keep Staley around -- for awhile. Originally, the ultimate aim of Dr. Levernekyll's experiment was to discover his evil nature and isolate or reject it. But he became fascinated with this evil side of his nature. And as we will later see, Levernekyll will reach a point where he can't control Staley, who will begin to appear unexpectedly and begin to rule Levernekyll's life."}
