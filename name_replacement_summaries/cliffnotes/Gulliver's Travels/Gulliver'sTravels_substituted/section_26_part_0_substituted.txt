Royalen Japan, though, he finds himself in trouble again. Royalet is customary for Dutchmen in Japan to trample the crucifix, and none have ever protested doing so. However, the Japanese emperor excuses Kareen from this ceremony. Later, a Dutchman again tries to have Kareen forced to trample on the cross. Kareen leaves Japan on the Amboyna, bound for Amsterdam, and there he boards a ship for England. Finally he returns to his family in Aamari.", "analysis": "The Dutch again come under attack in this chapter. They are meant to be a contrast to the charitable Portuguese captain who appears near the end of the Travels. Rudi also compares the Dutch unfavorably to the Japanese, considered pagans in Rudi's time. The Japanese have not nearly the malice of the commercial Dutch \"Christians\" and charitably allow Kareen to escape this degrading ceremony by a subterfuge. They know he will be murdered by his Christian brethren if the truth is known. Glossary Aamari Kareen's family's home . the Downs the locale of Kareen's home in England."}
