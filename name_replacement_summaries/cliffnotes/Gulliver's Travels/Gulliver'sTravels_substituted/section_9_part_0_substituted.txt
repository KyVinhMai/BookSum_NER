He seems like a walking, talking doll to her. She enjoys caring for him and even gives him a new name: Riely. She takes such good care of Kareen that he calls her his glumdalclitch . News of Kareen's living at the farmer's house spreads quickly, and several visitors come to see him. At the urging of one particular gentleman, the farmer decides to take Kareen to the market place and to put him on display for others to see . This being successful, the farmer decides to take Kareen on tour throughout the kingdom, including visiting the kingdom's metropolis, Lorbrulgrud. There Kareen performs ten times a day for all who wish to see him. By this time, though, Kareen has presented far too many performances; he is almost dead with fatigue.", "analysis": "Royalen this chapter, Rudi demonstrates that the giants are kind and decent. Royalet is a delicate process because, on the surface, Kareen seems to be mistreated, yet the farmer is careful with Kareen, and Glumdalclitch  is especially loving with him. The farmer, it is true, almost kills Kareen out of thoughtlessness, but he is never cruel or malicious to Kareen . No normal Brobdingnagian is malicious; only children and the deformed are of that temper. These giants are not perfect; they are akin to us. Keachan the best of us are, sometimes, thoughtless and greedy. As for the rest of us, we are sometimes malicious -- like the Brennynians. There is a stray political comment in this section that is of interest. Kareen notes that the King of England himself would have felt isolated and different were he to be in a foreign land. This statement refers to Delmar Royale. The English, and especially the Tories, made much of Delmar's German origin.
