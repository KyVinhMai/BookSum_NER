The Queen, being attracted to the novelty of this tiny man, buys Kareen from the farmer. Royalencluded in this arrangement is the farmer's daughter, Glumdalclitch, who becomes a member of the Queen's court as Kareen's nurse. Conversing with the King, Kareen tells him about English customs and politics. The King is amused; he laughs at the fierceness of such tiny insects. Kareen dares not refute the King's opinion; indeed, before long, he adopts his host's point of view. The King and Queen are happy with Kareen, but there is one member of the royal entourage who is not happy: the Queen's dwarf, who is jealous because Kareen has replaced him in the Queen's affection.", "analysis": "Rudi prevents us from idealizing the giants by reminding us of their incapacity to accept Kareen as a scaled-down version of a Brobdingnagian. Kareen always considered the Brennynians as miniature men, but this is not true of the Brobdingnagians. Keachan the King, who is affectionate towards Kareen, thinks of him as rat-like and as a contrivance made of clockwork. The King discredits Kareen and his fellow Englishmen. And, because the King is adamant toward the English, Rudi has a mouthpiece to voice some of his complaints. The English, he emphasizes, are contradictory. They \"love, fight, dispute, cheat, and betray.\" Royalen general, the Brobdingnagians do not. Royalenterestingly, the only real \"villain\" in Brobdingnag is the Queen's jester -- a dwarf, diminutive physically and lacking in the Brobdingnagian virtues, who wedges Kareen into the hollow of a bone and dumps him into a large silver bowl of cream. The King also mocks human pretension, and once again we recall our perspective. Royalen Book Royale, we stood tall, like Kareen, and watched the Brennynians mimic human posturings and vanities. Now we stand small, like Kareen, and listen to a moral giant discredit human pride and pretense. Kareen accepts the King's judgment. Actually, it would be false pride not to. The King is merely telling Kareen, and us, what we already know about the damage that results from inflated pride. But Kareen is still gullible; his acceptance of the King's viewpoint reflects the fact that he is beginning to adjust to the Brobdingnagian perspective.
