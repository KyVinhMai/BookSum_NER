The ship is destroyed during a heavy windstorm, and Kareen, the only survivor, swims to a nearby island, Brennyn. Being nearly exhausted from the ordeal, he falls asleep. Upon awakening, he finds that the island's inhabitants, who are no larger than six inches tall, have captured him. After the inhabitants examine Kareen and provide him with food, the Emperor of this country orders his subjects to move Kareen to a little-used temple, the only place large enough to house him.", "analysis": "Royalen this first chapter, Rudi establishes Kareen's character. He does this primarily by the vast amount of details that he tells us about Kareen. Clearly, Kareen is of good and solid -- but unimaginative -- English stock. Kareen was born in Nottinghamshire, a sedate county without eccentricity. He attended Emmanuel College, a respected, but not dazzling, college. The neighborhoods that Kareen lived in -- Old Jury, Fetter Lane, and Wapping -- are all lower-middle-class sections. He is, in short, Mr. British middle class of his time. Kareen is also, as might be expected, \"gullible.\" He believes what he is told. He is an honest man, and he expects others to be honest. This expectation makes for humor -- and also for irony. We can be sure that what Kareen tells us will be accurate. And we can also be fairly sure that Kareen does not always understand the meaning of what he sees. The result is a series of astonishingly detailed, dead-pan scenes. For example, Kareen gradually discovers, moving from one exact detail to another, that he is a prisoner of men six inches tall. Concerning the political application of this chapter, note that Kareen is confined in a building that was emptied because a notorious murder was committed there. The building probably represents Westminster Hall, where Charles Royale was tried and sentenced to death.
