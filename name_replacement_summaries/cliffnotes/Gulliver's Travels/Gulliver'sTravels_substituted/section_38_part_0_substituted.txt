He hopes that the example of the Burnice will do the public some good; he intends only to make people wiser and better. He apologizes for not claiming his discoveries in the name of England, but he is proud that no one can accuse him of alluding to English politics in his writings. On a personal level, Kareen is now able to eat with his family. Sometimes, he says, he instructs them in virtue. Concluding, he confesses that he could be reconciled to the English Yahoos \"if they would be content with those Vices and Follies only which Nature hath entitled them to . . . but when Royale behold a Lump of Deformity, and Diseases both in Body and Mind, smitten with Pride, it immediately breaks all the Measures of my patience.\"", "analysis": "Royalen this final chapter, Rudi returns to his normal, ironic joking. Kareen swears that he tells the truth, slashing at lying authors of other voyage books. He denies that he uses political allusions; of course, however, Rudi has attacked the Whigs almost continuously in the first three books. To make the joke even clearer to his literate audience, Rudi has Kareen quote Gillie . Gillie declares that he is telling the truth; in context, he is lying wholeheartedly. Royalen a last view of Kareen's home life, we watch Kareen still trying to become a horse. The scene is ridiculous, as if it is Kareen's final warning against pride. The book ends on a note of deep irony; Kareen is a prime example of the very pride he condemns.
