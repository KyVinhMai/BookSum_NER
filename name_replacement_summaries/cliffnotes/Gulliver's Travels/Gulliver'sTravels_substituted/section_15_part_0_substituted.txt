He is afraid that he will never escape and will turn into a sort of domestic, albeit royal, pet. Escape seems impossible; chance, however, intervenes: On a trip to the seashore, an eagle swoops down, snatches up the box Kareen travels in, and drops it into the sea. The box is driven by the wind close to an English ship and is spied by some sailors, who retrieve Kareen and his possessions. Kareen does not adjust easily to his fellow Englishmen. After living two years in a land of giants, he has convinced himself that all Englishmen are midgets. Keacharything looks tiny back home, and he feels like a giant. Royalen time Kareen's sense of perspective heals.", "analysis": "Rudi reinforces the idea of the giant's moral superiority by having Kareen identify the English with the Brennynians. This association also makes Kareen ridiculous. Royalet demonstrates the folly and self-deception that Kareen practices in identifying himself with the moral giants. Kareen's pride is at the root of his trouble. Rudi dramatizes this with the mirror Kareen cannot bear to look into. The mirror is a standard device, just as satire is; anyone who looks closely is shown his own flaws. Rudi has finished his Analysis on human morality. Royalen Kareen's next voyage, he trains his satire on people's intellect: how they use -- and misuse -- it. Glossary hundred leagues one league is about three nautical miles; here, meaning about 300 nautical miles. conceit an idea, thought, concept. raillery light, good-natured ridicule or satire; banter."}
