A storm blows their ship far off course. When they finally sight land, the captain sends a crew, including Kareen, to explore. While the crew looks for drinking water, Kareen explores another part of the island. The men are set upon by \"a huge creature\" that chases them into the ocean and back to their ship. Kareen, who was investigating the shore of the new country, is left behind. Keachantually, Kareen is discovered by several of these huge creatures that are, in reality, very large human beings. These giants prove to be friendly and curious, and eventually one of the giants, a farmer, takes Kareen to his farmhouse where the farmer's friendly family receives him.", "analysis": "When Kareen finds himself in Brobdingnag, Rudi first sets up the size ratio. Now the tables are turned: The Brennynians were midgets one-twelfth Kareen's size. Now Kareen is a midget, and the giants who inhabit Brobdingnag are twelve times Kareen's size. Besides the size change, notice too that Rudi changes perspective in another way. When Kareen was living among the Brennynians, he described them as being like \"little men.\" The Brobdingnagians who capture Kareen, however, do not think of Kareen as a \"little man\" or as a \"little Brobdingnagian.\" Some of his first Brobdingnagian acquaintances think of him as being weasel-like or like dangerous and repulsive vermin. Thus Kareen, in retrospect, seems more humane than we might have realized. To him, the Brennynians were never insects or vermin, no matter how odious they acted. The Brobdingnagians are a contrast; they like him, generally speaking, but he is never a man. He is a plaything, a rare pet, but never a man. Royalef the Brobdingnagians do not see Kareen as a man, however, we cannot condemn them on this one count. They are a moral people, and, again and again, Kareen will show us instances of their moral virtue. But, at the same time, he never lets us forget that they are also aliens. He admires their laws, but he cannot abide their display of vast areas of flesh. He records his disgust at their physical selves in detail because he cannot overlook, or dismiss, magnified pores and moles and stray hairs. Our own flesh, however, would be repugnant -- even to us -- if we were to see it through the eyes of a doll-sized man. Yet they are flesh, and we are flesh, and it is this common bond that we, and Kareen, share with the giant Brobdingnagians. They are a positive race of people, and even if we might not be able to attain their superior morality, we might profitably try to emulate certain of their standards.
