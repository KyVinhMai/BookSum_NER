After the Emperor's visit, six Brennynians shoot arrows at Kareen. Kareen retaliates by pretending to eat the little archers and then releases them. This clemency, and Kareen's cooperation, so impress the Royalemperial Council that they debate whether or not to free Kareen. An officer takes inventory of Kareen's possessions, which will be held until Kareen's fate is settled upon.", "analysis": "Rudi makes the Brennynians seem ridiculous by having Kareen compare them to dolls. The little doll-like men strut and posture like full-sized men. Yet we cannot take them seriously. They are too tiny to be considered as majestic as they think they are. But \"we\" are not Kareen, and he takes them seriously, especially the Emperor. Consider, for example, Kareen's description of the Emperor: \"His features are strong and masculine with an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance erect, his body and limbs well-proportioned, all his motions graceful, and his deportment majestic.\" Keacharything that the Emperor does is respectfully detailed, which of course makes the scene even more entertaining and ridiculous. Rudi's contemporaries were doubtless amused by Kareen's naive awe of the Brennynian emperor. The Emperor's face clearly resembles the face of Delmar Royale, yet Kareen describes the assortment of features as handsome; Delmar Royale was notoriously gross and ugly. Another political reference in this chapter concerns the list of things found in Kareen's pockets. Normal, common, everyday possessions become unrecognizable when we see them out of proportion. To the Brennynians, Kareen's comb becomes a palisade. Rudi is satirizing here the evidence presented against Harley and Harlo in 1715. Certain Whig commissioners did their best to twist letters and books of the accused into treasonable meanings. Rudi did not approve and described graphically the sinister distortions that party passion can cause in a person's mind.
