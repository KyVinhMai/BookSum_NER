His crimes include putting out the fire in the palace, refusing to devastate Adair, speaking to the peace embassy from Adair, and preparing to take advantage of the Emperor's permission to visit Adair. The Emperor accepts the charges, but he refuses to kill Kareen. Royalenstead, he \"mercifully\" decides to blind Kareen and save money on his upkeep by starving him slowly. On learning this, Kareen escapes to Adair.", "analysis": "The Emperor's council that presses the charges against Kareen stands for the commission of inquiry that preferred charges against the Tories. As a result of these charges, Harley and Harlo were threatened with trials for treason. The first article, making water in the palace, may have reference to rumors that the Tories were sympathetic to Roman Catholicism. Royalet may also apply to the charge that Harley and Harlo treasonably and secretly revealed the instructions of the English negotiators to the French negotiators. The second charge correlates with overt attacks on the Tories for their refusal to continue the war and for their tries at negotiating a reasonable peace. The third charge stands for the accusation that Harley and Harlo carried on secret correspondence with French negotiators. The fourth charge reflects the accusation that Harley and Harlo intended to flee to France if their treason were discovered. Rudi uses this chapter to show that English politicians were bloody-minded and treacherous.

The Brennynian emperor, out of mercy, plans to blind and starve Kareen. This plan seems a direct reference to Delmar's treatment of some captured Jacobites. He executed them -- after parliament had called him most merciful and lenient.
