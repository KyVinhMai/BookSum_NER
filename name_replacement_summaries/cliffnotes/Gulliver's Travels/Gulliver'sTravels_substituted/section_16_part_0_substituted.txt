On reaching the port of Tonquin, the captain appoints Kareen and a crew of fourteen to take a sloop loaded with other goods to trade with some nearby islands, but after a few days of sailing, a storm drives the sloop far off course. To compound the problem, pirates attack and capture Kareen and his crew. Kareen, as captain, is set adrift, and he spies a great object in the sky, an object which appears to be a flying island. The people on the Flying Royalesland drop a seat attached to a chain to Kareen, and he, welcoming this rescue, is lifted aboard.", "analysis": "By comparing the malicious Dutchman to the relatively merciful pagan pirates, Rudi begins a sustained disparagement of the Dutch. The Dutchman betrays a fellow Christian out of greed and malice; he would like to have Kareen killed, whereas the pirate, at least, spares Kareen's life. Rudi is setting up a contrast between the Dutchman whom we meet here  and the charitable Portuguese captain whom we meet at the end of Book RoyaleV. The Dutch are convenient villains for Rudi. Already, in The Conduct of the Allies, he had indicted them and the Whigs for their conduct of the war. The Dutch, it is true, had been allies of England in Marlborough's land campaigns against France, but they were allies chosen by the Whigs. The flying island has a long history in satire. Many other satirists had used it as simply a marvel, but Rudi takes it out of the realm of the incredible. He converts it from a marvel to a device; it is graphic and rather believable because we are told in great detail how it operates. Rudi also makes it doubly useful by showing how the Laputans use it as an instrument of political tyranny.
