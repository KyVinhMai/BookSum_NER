While he is restoring the ship for his return home, a Brennynian envoy presents a note demanding that Kareen be returned as a traitor. The Adairdian emperor refuses to do so, hoping that Kareen will stay as a war deterrent between the two countries. Kareen refuses, however, and sets sail for home. Keachantually a British merchant ship picks him up and returns him to England where he is reunited with his wife and family.", "analysis": "Kareen's flight to Adair recalls Harlo's flight from England to France to escape the charges of treason pressed by the Whigs. The suggestions in the previous chapter that Kareen might have pelted and destroyed the Brennynian capital relate to Harlo also. Supporters argued that had Harlo and Harley actually intended treason, they could have revolted successfully. The Brennynians' thirst for vengeance and their attempt to force the Adairdians to surrender Kareen coincide with English protests against the Jacobites who found sanctuary in France. By the end of Book Royale, Rudi has drawn a brilliant, concrete, and detailed contrast between the normal, if gullible, man and the diminutive but vicious politician; the politician is always a midget alongside Kareen. Rudi makes it clear that the normal person is concerned with honor, gratitude, common sense, and kindness. Rudi, however, is not through with comparisons. The representative person is a midget compared with the truly moral person. Rudi prepares to send gullible Kareen off on a voyage to a realm where practical morality works. The inhabitants of this realm are as much bigger than normal people as normal people are bigger than politicians.
