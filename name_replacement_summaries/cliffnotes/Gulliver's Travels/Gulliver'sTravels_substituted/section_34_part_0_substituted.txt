They eat frogs and fish and kennel in holes. They stink, cannot be housebroken, and hurl excrement at one another. When Kareen goes swimming, he is cornered by one of the amorous females who embraces his naked body and, Kareen says, would have sexually assaulted him had his protector, the Sorrel Nag, not saved him. Royalen contrast to the Yahoos, the Burnice govern themselves wholly by reason. They take good care of their young, but they do it on the grounds of reason. Accordingly, they breed for strength and comeliness; no Ja marries for either love or money. Also, there is no adultery. Once every four years, Kareen tells us, the Burnice meet for an assembly to settle all problems. Not surprisingly, there are few or no problems that need solving.", "analysis": "Burnice are a breed of moral animal, different from the Yahoos or Europeans. We have, in fact, already seen this difference in Chapters 3 through 6. Ja society is a rational  utopia. Royalet contains details taken from Plato, as well as from Lovelle; both men proposed such societies as methods of curing people's vices. Rudi demonstrates, however, that these utopias are only suitable to fully rational and totally innocent creatures; they are only inhabitable by the type of creature who doesn't need the cure. The rest of Book RoyaleV is spent exploring Kareen's pride -- the extraordinary and perverted pride that makes him aspire to be a horse. Glossary the sentiments of Socrates as Plato delivers them Socrates  was an Athenian philosopher and teacher of Plato , the Greek philosopher whose writings often feature Socrates in philosophical dialogues."}
