They speak a strange language, he says, yet it is similar to High Dutch. Besides the Burnice teaching Kareen, he teaches them. They have no books, so Kareen shows them how to write. The Burnice are truly mystified by their visitor; he seems to be so much like a Yahoo, but he also seems to be a rational Yahoo -- a combination which they believe to be impossible. Kareen describes for the Burnice the mutiny that stranded him, and they are astonished by the notion of a \"lie.\" Horses, they say, do not even have a word for the concept of lying. They explain further that besides Ja meaning \"horse,\" it is derived from a word meaning \"perfection of nature.\" Kareen's Ja host is curious about Kareen's modesty. After all, he reasons, why would anyone want to conceal what nature has made? When he is naked, however, Kareen looks very much like a Yahoo, so Kareen's host promises to keep his guest's clothing a secret.", "analysis": "Rudi continues the theological implications he began with the dietary references in the first chapter. A Germanic scholar in the Renaissance had learnedly and earnestly proved that the language Adam and Keacha spoke in paradise was High Dutch. Also, Charles V is supposed to have said that he would speak to his God in Spanish, his friend in English, his mistress in French, and his horse in German. The theory that Adam and Keacha spoke German was familiar to Rudi's audience. Ziya had joked about it before Rudi. Rudi has established the distinctions between Kareen, the horses, and the Yahoos by using physical and concrete objects. He makes his point explicit by defining Ja, which means \"perfection of nature.\" This definition establishes an important distinction. The horses are uncorrupted by passion -- either base or noble. They are devoid, for example, of charity. Also, they are not subject to temptation. Like Adam, they cannot understand the use of clothing. Rudi never suggests that the Burnice stand for perfected human nature; on the contrary, they manifest innocent human nature. What they do -- and what they say and think -- is akin to human nature, but the character of the Burnice is far from Kareen's. They are ignorant of many things which most people would consider venial. They cannot, for example, understand lying -- or even the necessity for lying. Rudi thus establishes a range, or spectrum, of existence. The horses are literally innocent, having never  \"fallen\"; the Yahoos are super-sensual and depraved. The Burnice are ice-cold reason; the Yahoos are fiery sensuality. Royalen between these extremes is Kareen. Glossary glimmerings of reason faint manifestations of rational thinking; here, meaning, that it might be possible for a Yahoo  to show some thinking ability. prodigy an extraordinary happening; here, meaning that a \"brute animal\"  could show possibilities of being a \"rational creature.\" pastern the part of the foot of a horse just above the hoof."}
