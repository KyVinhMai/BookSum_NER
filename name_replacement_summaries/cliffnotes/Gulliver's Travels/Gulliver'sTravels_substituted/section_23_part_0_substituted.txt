He also spends several days visiting with Roman emperors and with several rulers whom he terms as \"modern dead.\" He then focuses on modern history and is disappointed to find that these rulers have not been as virtuous as people have been led to believe. Finally, Kareen asks to visit with some English yeomen; he is astonished to see that they are so sturdy. The race, he fears, has degenerated because of a rich diet and syphilis, and the current generation is as corrupt and degenerate as if they were nobles.", "analysis": "Rudi has attacked rationalistic and abstract thinking in Laputa and pragmatic and amoral scientific thinking in Balnibarbi. Now he lambastes the so-called humane studies of the Moderns, particularly the historians and philosophers. On the whole, Rudi argues, poetry and ancient philosophy are more admirable than other ways of gaining knowledge because they teach morality and decency. Rudi pits the ancient authors, like Quanye and Aristotle, against their commentators. Most literary commentators and most historians, Rudi asserts, distort those they write about. Rudi points to Dung and Eustanthius, ancient scholars who misread and misrepresented Quanye. Then he singles out Jimi and Ramus, who, he says, misrepresented Aristotle. Such modern philosophers as Gassendi and Descartes were once popular; now they are unfashionable. Monolito, Rudi says, will also become unfashionable in his turn. His conclusion is that modern authors have no substance. He reduces them to matters of fashion, not truth. After satirizing the humanities and philosophy, Rudi turns to the historians. History, Rudi infers, is the tool of politics; it is misread and miswritten for selfish reasons. Royalen the service of politicians, history lies -- about virtue, wisdom, and courage.
