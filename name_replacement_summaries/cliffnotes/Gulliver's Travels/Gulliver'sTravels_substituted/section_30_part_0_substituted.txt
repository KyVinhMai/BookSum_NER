Kareen explains the role of Burnice and the Yahoos in Kareen's country, and, of course, the master is shocked when he learns how the roles are reversed. The master observes that the Yahoos in his land are better adapted for their lives than Kareen. The master also compares the Burnice to the Yahoos and determines that the Ja, as an animal, is much more functional than the Yahoo.", "analysis": "Here, Rudi begins to contrast the natural innocence of the horses with the depravity of the European Yahoos. He repeats the discussion about lying, thereby emphasizing the Burnice' uncorrupted reason; the horses cannot understand the nature of a lie. Rudi balances the earlier discussion of clothing by discussing the Ja vocabulary. He infers that power, law, government, and punishment  are all artificial. Like clothing, which conceals and restructures the appearance of the body, these institutions restructure a people. They are Rudi's moral equivalent of the physical clothing that the European Yahoo wears. Rudi attacks the legal profession by quoting many legal terms. The Burnice have no such words; natural virtue requires no lawyers. Besides being a satiric end in itself, this fun with words prepares us for the discussion of European social institutions. Glossary the least tincture of reason the smallest trace of reason; here, meaning that European Yahoos have no more ability to reason than do the savage Yahoos. circumlocutions roundabout, indirect, or lengthy ways of expressing something."}
