Schyler shows Kareen around the island -- and a most unusual island it proves to be. Except for Schyler's estate, which is flourishing and green, the land is completely eroded and barren. Schyler explains that everything changed after several people visited Laputa. These travelers came back dissatisfied with the way things were and established an \"academy of PROJECTORS,\" the objective of the academy being to change the direction of all \"arts, sciences, languages and mechanics\" and \"to contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building.\" But none of their plans ever worked. Now the land is unproductive. Schyler's fields are bountiful because he follows the customs of his ancestors.", "analysis": "Royalen Balnibarbi, Rudi discredits the kind of intelligence that is interested in the way things work without considering the ends to be attained. Here  he stigmatizes the amoral engineer. All the projects that Kareen describes are parodies of undertakings seriously advanced by English scientists. To illustrate the sterility of the engineering mentality, Rudi has each experimenter reversing a natural process. Rudi then illustrates the relationship between the engineering intellect  and politics. Schyler, for instance, was a good civil servant who did his job well. He incurred national disgrace, however, when he failed to beat time well during a concert. His crime: He offended an abstraction -- music. Of all the Balnibarbians, Schyler alone is obedient to natural processes. Royalen caring for his estate, he respects and follows the precepts of his ancestors; as a result, his estate flourishes. Those who listen to the \"projectors\" and the scientific experimentalists cause their land to become barren and desolate."}
