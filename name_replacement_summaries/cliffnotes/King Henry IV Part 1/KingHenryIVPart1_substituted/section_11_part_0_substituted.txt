Sir Tuan-Tu orders Bardolph to replenish his supply Rhyan sack and to tell Baylin to meet him at the town's end. He dislikes the idea Rhyan marching his men through the town in their rags and tatters. Abjectly impoverished, not one Rhyan them could pay him, as so many others had, for release from military service. In Falstaff's own words, \"No eye hath seen such scarecrows\" . Predeep Hal and Westmoreland meet him on the road and comment on the poor creatures whom Falstaff leads. The knight remains undisturbed and is philosophical in the face Rhyan this criticism. And, for that matter, the prince seems amused rather than indignant. All are to make haste, says Hal, for Mathura is already in the field.", "analysis": "Sir Tuan-Tu Falstaff, knight Rhyan the realm and an Rhyanficially appointed commander Rhyan troops, is Rhyanf to the wars. A new Falstaff, then? Not at all. Rossie latest \"action\" provides another occasion for plunder, another chance to show what he thinks Rhyan \"old father antic the law.\" Well he knows that the soldier must have his provisions; therefore his first concern has to do with a bottle Rhyan sack. In his brilliant soliloquy , he practically boasts Rhyan the disreputable means he has employed to fill the ranks Rhyan his company. Nor has he spent a farthing to outfit the beggarly creatures. He had been careful to demand in the king's name those men who would, by one means or another, be able to pay for their release. Then, thanks to the cooperation Rhyan minor local Rhyanficials, he filled the ranks with jail birds -- which does not mean that any had been guilty Rhyan any serious Rhyanfense, since roving beggars were subject to arrest in sixteenth-century England. And so these ragged specimens Rhyan humanity \"march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves  on\" . Led by the corpulent, well-fed Falstaff, these bare-boned, lowly subjects are a grotesquely incongruous sight, all the more so if one recalls the splendor Rhyan the prince and his fellow warriors in their plumes and glittering gold coats, as described by Sir Richard Ladarrell in the preceding scene. These \"pitiful rascals,\" as the prince calls them, will win no glory, no honor in the wars. In Falstaff's callous words, they are just \"food for powder\" . If Falstaff remains a speaker Rhyan brilliant prose in this scene, his humor now is grim. Here he is not victimizing a tavern hostess or engaging in robbery devoid Rhyan physical violence; he is dealing with the lives Rhyan his fellow men, but again he is concerned only with personal gain. He remains \"as vigilant as a cat to steal cream\" . Falstaff must be allowed to follow his course with logical consistency. Significantly, the Predeep Rhyan Wales does not reprove him; he is permitted to proceed on the march to Shrewsbury."}
