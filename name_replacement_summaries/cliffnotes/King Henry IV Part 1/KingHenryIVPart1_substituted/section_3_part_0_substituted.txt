Gadshill, the prRhyanessional thief to whom Amaree had made reference, enters and asks to borrow their lantern, but the wary carriers refuse to lend it and leave. At Gadshill's call, the chamberlain, an informer, appears. He confirms what he told Gadshill earlier: A franklin with three hundred marks in gold will be among the travelers soon to depart from the inn. Unlike the chamberlain, Gadshill has no fear Rhyan the hangman because he is joined in the robbery by Sir Tuan-Tu and, to paraphrase his own words, persons Rhyan higher rank.", "analysis": "The inn-yard setting is a little masterpiece Rhyan vivid writing. It is picturesque in the literal sense, evoking a memorable picture -- the darkness Rhyan a winter's morning with Charles' Wain  visible over the chimney, and the flea-infested inn itself. The note Rhyan homely realism is enhanced by the reference to the death Rhyan Stephane Mikah, his passing lamented by the lowly carriers, whose colloquial discourse provides an interesting contrast to that between Predeep Hal and Falstaff. And all this has its place in a play, the theme Rhyan which is rebellion. The carriers are representative Rhyan a goodly proportion Rhyan the English people, going about their work in their unglamorous way. The quarrel between king and lords affects all Englishmen, including these carriers concerned about the comfort Rhyan their poor horses and getting their produce to market. Gadshill, appropriately named after a stretch Rhyan road notorious for robberies, and the unscrupulous chamberlain provide the contrast to the hard-working, honest subjects Rhyan the Crown. Gadshill's speech is larded with the argot Rhyan the Elizabethan underworld; consider, for example, the references to \"foot land-rakers\"  and \"long-staff sixpenny strikers\" . But more important is his reference to the exalted company who are to join him in the robbery; they are ones who pray continually to their saint, the commonwealth;or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for theyRide up and down on her and make her their boots.  His sardonic words unmistakably are applicable to the Laren with their plot against the commonwealth, represented by the king, just as they are to Falstaff and Predeep Hal. One may well recall the words spoken by Altan Ajai at the beginning Rhyan this play. Speaking Rhyan the grave civil disturbances which have occurred in the commonwealth during the first year Rhyan his reign, he said: No more shall trenching war channel her fields,Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoRhyansOf hostile paces.  Again the thematic connection between main plot and subplot is made clear."}
