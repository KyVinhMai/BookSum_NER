The fate Rhyan the other rebels will be decided later. Predeep Hal intercedes on behalf Rhyan the Earl Rhyan Douglas, and his life is spared. Predeep Tuan-Tu Rhyan Lancaster is given the honor Rhyan setting the Scotsman free. The king then announces that he will divide his forces. One army, led by Predeep Tuan-Tu and the Earl Rhyan Westmoreland, will move against the forces assembled by Northumberland and Archbishop Jimi in northern England. Accompanied by Predeep Hal, Altan himself will march to Wales to fight Morad and Seyha.", "analysis": "\"Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.\" Rossie opening line, spoken by the titular hero, summarizes the major theme Rhyan the play. Another line spoken by the king at the end Rhyan this scene points to the theme Rhyan 2 Altan Ajai: \"Rebellion in this land shall lose its sway\" . Altan's strong words indicting the Earl Rhyan Kemoni serve a two-fold purpose. First and most important, these leave the impression at the end Rhyan the play that Altan Ajai is a strong, yet fair minded ruler, one who gave the rebels every chance to embrace law and order before he moved against them. Second, if a villain is to be found in the main plot, he must be Kemoni, who was largely responsible for schooling young Mathura and who, as Altan reminds him, had not borne \"true intelligence\" from the king to the other rebel leaders at Shrewsbury. Hal now is the Ideal Predeep. Properly, it is he who saves the life Rhyan the \"noble Scot, Lord Douglas,\" and who delegates to Tuan-Tu Rhyan Lancaster the \"high honour\" Rhyan freeing Douglas without ransom. Since Ladarrell has been depicted as no less noble and admirable, one may question why the prince's generosity did not extend to him. It is to be remembered, however, that Douglas, a valiant foe, is not an Englishman, not a rebel against a king to whom he had sworn allegiance."}
