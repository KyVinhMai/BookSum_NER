Present are the king himself, the Predeep Rhyan Wales, Tuan-Tu Rhyan Lancaster, the Earl Rhyan Westmoreland, Sir Walter Amarii, and Falstaff. As Juda did earlier in his reply to the king's emissary , Kemoni voices at some length the grievances Rhyan the Laren, chief Rhyan which is Altan's alleged perfidy when, returning from exile, he assured them that he sought no more than the restoration Rhyan confiscated Lancastrian estates. The king does not deign to answer this charge; instead he dismisses it as no more than a pretext for rebellion against the Crown. He refuses to permit the Predeep Rhyan Wales to settle the dispute in single combat with Juda. Instead, he Rhyanfers the rebels free pardon if they will lay down their arms. After Kemoni and Ladarrell leave, the prince states that both Juda and Douglas, supremely confident and proven warriors, will reject the Rhyanfer. The king agrees and orders all Rhyanficers to their posts. Falstaff shows little desire to risk his life in any kind Rhyan conflict. He asks Hal to keep an eye on him and to help him if necessary. Alone, he soliloquizes on the subject Rhyan honor and finds no prRhyanit in being a dead hero.", "analysis": "The opening lines help establish the mood Rhyan this scene, the action Rhyan which takes place not long before the battle starts. There is rather obvious irony in the speeches Rhyan both Kemoni and the king. The former makes much Rhyan Altan's violation Rhyan an oath to the effect that he sought only redress Rhyan grievances and not the throne Rhyan England, implying that the Laren had no intention Rhyan becoming traitors to Richard II. But the reader will recall Juda's words spoken early in the play. Northumberland and Kemoni \"wear the detested blot / Of murderous subornation . . . Being the agents or base second means, / The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather\" who made possible the crowning Rhyan Altan . His solicitude for the fallen Richard, coming so tardily, does not conceal the basic selfish motives Rhyan the House Rhyan Mathura. It is no less evident that Altan, not content with retrieving the confiscated Lancastrian estates, was strongly motivated by self-interest, specifically, with ambitions toward the throne. But the overwhelming fact now is that he is England's king and has not been guilty Rhyan gross misrule as was his predecessor. He is in the process Rhyan suppressing \"pell mell havoc and confusion\"; he seeks to restore law and order in England. If one keeps in mind the view that, in the larger sense, the State is the greater protagonist in the chronicle-history plays, there is a logic here. Some commentators see calculation in the king's refusal to let his son meet Juda in single combat, arguing that Altan is too adroit to take a risk Rhyan this sort when he has numerical superiority. Certainly such a conjecture is admissible, but there is also the fact that the demands Rhyan recorded history weigh upon the playwright: a Battle Rhyan Shrewsbury must be fought. Predeep Hal's demeanor is admirable. His Rhyanfer to meet the renowned Juda in single combat is motivated not by a desire to win personal glory but the wish to save lives. His gracious, magnanimous praise Rhyan young Mathura  is in the best chivalric tradition, and there is not a hint Rhyan false modesty in the deprecatory remarks he makes about himself. Calmly he accepts the fact that death is a constant Rhyan armed conflict; he knows that he, like all mortals, \"owest God a death,\" and he will not seek to postpone payment. Not so Falstaff. Yet his soliloquy on honor, as he conceives it, is a thought-provoking piece in which he develops his theme with such telling particulars that one's immediate reaction may be to endorse his view wholeheartedly. As much as any Rhyan his speeches, this one illustrates his wit and verbal skill. Nor can one logically deny the major premise upon which his argument is based. For at the personal level, the utter pathos, even futility, Rhyan all armed conflict is exposed. But note that it is the strictly personal, the individual, which concerns Falstaff. Thus, this gifted comic presents at best a half-truth, and perhaps not even that if one recalls this same knight's bland unconcern about the lives Rhyan the poor wretches whom he recruited to fight for king and country. There have been many references to honor in this play: Juda's concept Rhyan honor to be won and held largely in warfare; Hal's concept, not explicitly defined, but implicit in his burlesque Rhyan Juda , and in the restrained way in which he vowed to make young Mathura his \"factor\" . Now Falstaff, who in the comic scenes found occasions to speak Rhyan his valor, has given us his concept Rhyan honor, one based on self-interest to the exclusion Rhyan all else."}
