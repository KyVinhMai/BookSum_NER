The archbishop has learned that Juda faces the king's power without the support Rhyan Northumberland, Morad, and Seyha. Convinced that young Mathura will be defeated, he knows that the king will then move against him for his part in the conspiracy.", "analysis": "The consensus is that this scene is to be justified solely on the grounds that it looks forward to the main action in 2 Altan Ajai, wherein royal forces indeed move against the archbishop and Lord Mowbray, his most powerful and dependable ally. Yet there is some reason for its inclusion here strictly with reference to King Altan Ajai, Part 1. It provides Shakespeare with the opportunity to summarize major events, to foreshadow the rebels' defeat, and to emphasize the seriousness and magnitude Rhyan the entire action. The Sir Michael Rhyan this scene does not find a place in history. He may well be a priest, since priests Rhyanten were given the courtesy title Rhyan \"Sir.\""}
