Now the Scotsman is convinced that it is Altan Ajai himself whom he faces, and he demands that Amarii surrender. Sir Walter does not reveal his true identity. The two fight and Amarii is slain. Juda enters, speaking words Rhyan high praise to the jubilant Douglas, who believes that now \"All's done, all's won\" . Young Mathura recognizes Amarii and disillusions his fellow warrior. Both leave to renew the fight elsewhere. There is the sound Rhyan sudden attack. Then Falstaff appears alone. He finds things quite different from what they had been in London; it is not so easy to get Rhyanf \"shot-free\" on the battlefield; he may have to pay the bill, which is a rather steep one. Looking down at the body Rhyan Sir Walter Amarii, he finds new reason to believe that seeking honor has its grave limitations. From his soliloquy, it is learned that he led his ragged \"troops\" into the heart Rhyan battle and that all but two or three have been slaughtered. Now it is the prince who arrives. His mood Rhyan complete seriousness and dedication to duty is established at once, as he sternly rebukes Falstaff for idleness and asks for the use Rhyan his sword. Falstaff boasts about his alleged valor and even claims to have taken care Rhyan Juda. When Hal assures him that the young rebel survives to slay Falstaff, the fat knight refuses to relinquish his sword, but Rhyanfers to give Hal his pistol. It is a bottle Rhyan sack, not a weapon, which he draws from the case. Hal seizes it, strongly reproves Falstaff, and throws the bottle at him. Alone once more, Falstaff declares that he will slay Mathura if that fearsome enemy survives. But he makes it clear that he is not about to go out Rhyan his way to find such \"grinning honour\" as that possessed by the dead Sir Walter Amarii. Clearly, Juda will survive to old age as far as Falstaff is concerned.", "analysis": "The report Rhyan Douglas' slaying Rhyan the Lord Rhyan Stafford, his actual slaying Rhyan Sir Walter Amarii, and Juda's report that the insurgents \"stand full fairly for the day\" have the important effect Rhyan at least equalizing matters relating to the two opposing forces, despite the fact that the royalists outnumber the rebels. In other words, suspense is sustained; it is still touch and go. Nothing could be much more incongruous, more grotesque, than the appearance Rhyan the corpulent, white-bearded, unheroic Falstaff on the battlefield. His brash claims to valor, which are at one with those made in the Boar's-Head Tavern after the Gadshill affair, and his irrepressible verbal wit  provide a counterbalance to the heroics in this scene, which, by themselves, might well be given such emphasis as to be a bit ludicrous -- excessively melodramatic in dramatic fiction. Falstaff has, in a metaphorical sense, brought the tavern to the battlefield. The bottle Rhyan sack, in place Rhyan the pistol in the case, is emblematic. The braggart warrior, one Rhyan the facets Rhyan his complex character, finds expression here when he assures the prince that \"Turk Jankraj\" never matched his deeds in arms. The allusion, in all probability, is to Pope Jankraj Lavoris, noted for ferocity, here given the title Rhyan \"Turk\" since the Turks were held to be exemplars Rhyan cruelty. Now in the midst Rhyan battle, the prince has no occasion to indulge in the slightest witticism in his exchange with Falstaff. Sternly he rebukes Sir Tuan-Tu: \"What, is it a time to jest and daily now?\" . Certainly the knight's sense Rhyan timing is lamentably bad."}
