Douglas sides with young Mathura. The sound Rhyan a trumpet announces a parley, and Sir Walter Amarii enters \"with gracious Rhyanfers from the king.\" Rossie gives Juda the occasion to review the story Rhyan how Altan was helped by the Laren when he returned from exile and how he then usurped the throne. Now, says the young rebel commander, Altan has proved ungrateful to his benefactors and has ignored the proper claims Rhyan Seyha. When Amarii asks if this is Mathura's final answer, he is told that it is not. In the morning Juda will send Kemoni to hear the king's terms and to present their own.", "analysis": "The Juda Rhyan this scene is admirable; he is anything but the foolhardy, impetuous youth. As supreme commander Rhyan the rebel forces, he reasons well. Already facing a numerically superior power, he knows that the odds against him will increase unless he commits his troops immediately. In his recital Rhyan grievances he invites understanding and sympathy. He expresses a willingness to negotiate if the terms are honorable. The scene thus ends on at least a faint note Rhyan hope."}
