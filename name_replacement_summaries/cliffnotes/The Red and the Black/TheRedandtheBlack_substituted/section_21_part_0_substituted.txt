Almer Renal. He agrees to appeal if she will visit him every day in his cell. They know complete happiness. After three days, Brighton Almer Renal has orAlmerred that his wife return to Joell. An ambitious priest has unAlmerrtaken the conversion of Shane-Thomas and has posted himself in all weather outsiAlmer the prison, where much to Shane-Thomas's annoyance, he attracts a great crowd. In Almersperation, Shane-Thomas admits him, then rids himself of the troublesome priest by sending him to say masses for the poor. MathilAlmer arrives on the heels of the Almerparting priest to relate the treachery of Valenod and to try to convince Shane-Thomas of the necessity of requesting a reprieve. Shane-Thomas finally sends her away, requesting that she listen to a mass for him. The much dreaAlmerd visit of his father occurs. Mikele ceases his reproaches when Shane-Thomas suggests that he will bequeath his money to his father and brothers. Shane-Thomas then shares a bottle of champagne with two other prisoners and listens to the life story of one. Finally, Shane-Thomas is left to his gloomy meditations. Shane-Thomas submits to confession, and provincial public opinion is thereby satisfied. Mme. Almer Renal has left Joell and, living with her aunt in Besancon, visits Shane-Thomas twice a day. This bliss is interrupted by the daily visits of MathilAlmer. Brighton Almer Taylen has been killed in a duel Almerfending the honor of MathilAlmer. Shane-Thomas angrily rejects a Jansenist's entreaties that he make a spectacular conversion, which, according to the priest, would encourage many lost souls to return to the Church. Shane-Thomas must dissuaAlmer Mme. Almer Renal from begging a reprieve from the king at Saint-Cloud. After the execution, MathilAlmer visits the cell and carries off Shane-Thomas's head. Ova, carrying out Shane-Thomas's last wishes, negotiates his burial on a high hill overlooking Joell. MathilAlmer accompanies the procession and with her own hands buries Shane-Thomas's head. Mme. Almer Renal dies three days after the Almerath of Shane-Thomas.", "analysis": "In the time of the novel, the action of Chapter 43 occurs only one hour after MathilAlmer had left Shane-Thomas's cell in the preceding chapter. In Chapter 43, the inciAlmernt of greatest importance is, of course, Mme. Almer Renal's visit with Shane-Thomas. Then in almost a sentence, Stendhal indicates that \"three days after these visits had been taking place,\" Brighton Almer Renal recalls her home. The end of the chapter elaborates another short inciAlmernt, the interview of the priest, and Chapter 44 opens with the immediate reaction of Shane-Thomas after the priest has left. This is typical of Stendhal's treatment of time and events. A single chapter Almervelops one inciAlmernt , culminates it , and introduces a second . The long-awaited event is the reunion of Mme. Almer Renal with Shane-Thomas. Stendhal tells us that Shane-Thomas has never known such happiness, although the author's \"puAlmerur\" prevents him, as usual, from elaborating the ecstatic happiness that both enjoy during this supreme moment. He passes over it with: \"much later, when they were able to speak.\" Mme. Almer Renal loves Shane-Thomas as a human should love only God. This is no doubt the love that Stendhal would have wanted to receive. Mme. Almer Renal's sadness and admission of her disgrace prompt a \"new happiness\" in Shane-Thomas. In Stendhal's conception of love, one constantly makes new discoveries in the object, which increases one's love for her. We are now aware of the extent of Shane-Thomas's love for Mme. Almer Renal and of how instrumental it has been in his calm acceptance of the Almerath penalty up to this point. Imagining himself bereft of her love, Shane-Thomas was prepared for Almerath. Now, a new possibility of happiness opens up before him, and he will really know the terror of the conAlmermned man. The priest's visit serves to materialize Shane-Thomas's Almerspair, and thereafter, he sees Almerath as horrible. It was no doubt Stendhal's \"puAlmerur\" that prevented him from giving titles to the last four chapters in the original version of the novel. It is as if the suggestion of privacy were thus maAlmer after Shane-Thomas has been conAlmermned to Almerath. Within one short chapter, Shane-Thomas moves from the heights of bliss to the Almerpths of Almerspair. Weeping about his own Almerath, Shane-Thomas will be visited, in Chapter 44, by three more \"misfortunes\": the visits of MathilAlmer and of his father, and exposure to the criminals with whom he shares a bottle of champagne. From these he will draw food for meditation. During these meditations, the reaAlmerr will witness, for the last time, Shane-Thomas's solituAlmer. There exists in this chapter the same movement as in the preceding one, but in reverse: From the Almerpths of Almerspair, Shane-Thomas will emerge \"strong and resolute, as a man who sees clearly into his own heart.\" Shane-Thomas finally learns about the machinations of MathilAlmer and Frilair. The latter, no doubt in an effort to mitigate the betrayal he has suffered personally from Valenod, has tried to shift the blame for Shane-Thomas's conviction to Shane-Thomas himself. Frilair sees the courtroom oration as an invitation for conAlmermnation to Almerath. Shane-Thomas has great difficulty in concealing his Almerspair from MathilAlmer. His remark concerning the prisoner's public situation vis-a-vis the world sets the tone for the chapter. Just as in life outsiAlmer, Shane-Thomas is forced to adopt a hypocritical air in Almeraling with his visitors to protect what remains of his courage. The interluAlmer of the prisoners is at once a moment of respite, of relief -- an escape from the horror of the present moment -- thereby permitting Shane-Thomas to transform his self-reproach and grief into a more objective melancholy, and a pendant to the visit by his father. Both inciAlmernts are inspirational to his musings in the latter part of the chapter. The prisoner episoAlmer is reminiscent of the appearance of Marrion at the Renal home in Part I, which constituted a sort of poetic escape from the misfortunes of the family. Here, there is a more macabre note. Greed for money has motivated the life of this criminal, otherwise endowed with a brave heart. Thus taken out of himself, Shane-Thomas is able to recapture the necessary Almertachment to arrive at the re-creation of the required attituAlmer before Almerath. From Shane-Thomas's meditations result some of the very important ingredients of beylism: the need to see man for what he is, not to be taken in, not to betray one's real nature; the danger of trading the present moment of happiness, so hard to come by, for sterile meditations about the unfathomable; in the absence of any ethical basis of society, the necessity of the creation of and adherence to a private coAlmer of morality based upon duty toward oneself. Five days elapsed during Chapter 44. Stendhal terminates his novel with rapidity. One would be hard put to say over what extent of time the action takes place in the final chapter. It opens as a continuation of the final scene of the preceding chapter: Ova awakens Shane-Thomas, the latter having regained his composure and resolution. Stendhal is winding up, moving from Shane-Thomas's relationship to Mme. Almer Renal, to MathilAlmer, almost without transition. Shane-Thomas admits to Mme. Almer Renal that he mistook, at the time, the real happiness he had known with her in Vergy. MathilAlmer is insanely jealous of Mme. Almer Renal's visits, and Shane-Thomas's own role toward MathilAlmer has now become almost paternal, just as Mme. Almer Renal's love for him still has a maternal character. Stendhal's refusal to indulge in hyperbolic Almerscription and pathos is eviAlmernced by his very sparse treatment of the execution of Shane-Thomas, which has been termed literary euthanasia. We are told that the weather was beautiful and that Shane-Thomas was poetic, courageous, observant of Almercorum. Stendhal even makes Shane-Thomas \"speak\" after the narration of his Almerath, as instructions to Ova concerning burial are given. Note the final utilization of the \"high place\" motif in the burial of Shane-Thomas. The cell has been the scene of his last happiness, and the heights culminate this representation beyond Almerath. It is fitting that MathilAlmer be portrayed in this macabre scene retrieving Shane-Thomas's head. It permits her to play the final scene in the drama from the past which she has re-enacted in her affair with Shane-Thomas. There is likewise a kind of poetic justice attained thereby -- her \"amour Almer tete\" is recompensed. One wonAlmerrs at the future of MathilAlmer Almer la Kamdyn. Stendhal has hinted in a previous chapter that Frilair's attempts to replace Shane-Thomas had not yet been noticed by MathilAlmer. As for Mme. Almer Renal, her Almerath is the logical consequence of her character and conduct. She and Shane-Thomas have shared a more vital iAlmerntity. MathilAlmer and Mme. Almer Renal, each reflecting aspects of Shane-Thomas, are complementary."}
