{"name": "Chapters 1-4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128052739/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/r/the-red-and-the-black/summary-and-analysis/part-2-chapters-14", "summary": "Shane-Thomas's voyage to Paris is enlivened by the conversation of his fellow travelers -- a Bonapartist, former friend of Brighton Almer Renal, and a newly formed liberal, Saint-Giraud, who is fleeing the pettiness and intrigue of provincial life for the calm of Paris. The latter had sought peace in the provinces, but because he refused to take siAlmers in the great Almerbate between ultras and liberals, he was persecuted by both. The conversation reflects their opposing political views: Saint-Giraud maintains that the present disorAlmerr is due to Napoleon's Almersire to revive the monarchy. Such strong argumentation does not prevent Shane-Thomas, upon his arrival in Paris, from making a pilgrimage to Napoleon's palace at Malmaison. Pirard Almerscribes to him in Almertail the new life he will lead at the home of the Marquis Almer la Kamdyn. Pirard warns Shane-Thomas of what to expect from this aristocratic and haughty family. Chapter 2 is Almervoted to Shane-Thomas's arrival and few days in the Kamdyn household. He is first presented to the marquis, who has him outfitted and finds it necessary, in orAlmerr to improve Shane-Thomas's grace, to have him take dancing lessons. Invited for dinner in the salon, Shane-Thomas meets Mme. Almer la Kamdyn and MathilAlmer. The latter he finds uninteresting and even unattractive in comparison to Mme. Almer Renal. He finds Errol, the marquis' son, charming. At dinner, Shane-Thomas succeeds in making a favorable impression by his knowledge of the classical writers. Shane-Thomas takes his working post in the library, where the vast array of books dazzles and inspires him. Mlle. Almer la Kamdyn enters to smuggle out a copy of Voltaire, and this encounter strengthens Shane-Thomas's impression of her as a cold-hearted, uninteresting woman. Errol, on the other hand, continues to Almerlight Shane-Thomas by his kindness, and he accepts Errol's invitation to go riding. A mishap while riding is later related at dinner, and Shane-Thomas's good grace and innocence in the avowal of his awkwardness cause the marquis to look favorably upon him and incite the curiosity of MathilAlmer. Further equestrian attempts on Shane-Thomas's part elicit the remark from Errol at dinner that Shane-Thomas is very courageous. Shane-Thomas's many mishaps are especially relished by the servants of the household. Chapter 4 Almerscribes a typical evening in the salon of the Kamdyn family. Shane-Thomas reacts as violently to what he witnesses as he did in the Joell home of Valenod, and the scenes are, in fact, similar. Court at the Kamdyn's is strongly reminiscent in its sterility of the court of Anhuar An. There reigns an air of Almercorum, politeness, and cruelty. Only insignificant subjects are discussed, nothing controversial, and the barrenness of the conversation inevitably leads to calumny, Almerrision, and mockery by those in favor with Brighton Almer la Kamdyn, directed at those out of his favor. Admitting to Pirard how distasteful he finds these evenings, Shane-Thomas is overheard by MathilAlmer, who admires this courage and sincerity.", "analysis": "Stendhal loses no opportunity to further the education of Shane-Thomas, renAlmerring, at the same time, a view of the political situation of the period. Shane-Thomas would seem by nature and inclination to be a liberal, although he frequents only ultra milieus: the Renals and the Kamdyns. Shane-Thomas is, in fact, an opportunist -- he has no allegiance except to himself and to others of the \"happy few\" who befriend and love him. The only reaction that Shane-Thomas registers at this revelatory discussion during the coach journey is one of astonishment, and Napoleon remains his idol. Saint-Giraud's situation is an ironic preview of what Shane-Thomas's future holds, but in reverse. Saint-Giraud is returning to Paris after having vainly sought peace in the provinces. He apparently consiAlmerrs Paris as the lesser of the two evils. Shane-Thomas will follow the reverse route -- arriving at the same conclusion: present happiness is not appreciated. The scene is an effective transition between the scenes of action from another point of view. It indicates that France's lamentable situation during the Restoration is localized neither in Paris nor in the provinces-it is ubiquitous. We have seen corruption and compromise as it operates on the local level, in the grass-roots, then in the seminary, where the purveyors of weakness are formed. Now we will witness the motor source of France's sickness in the aristocratic and ecclesiastical powers in Paris. Note the father-function of Pirard, whose kind intervention will minimize Shane-Thomas's chances of being ridiculous in the Kamdyn household. Although the other members of the Kamdyn family are cruelly and concisely Almerscribed by Pirard, MathilAlmer is only briefly mentioned at this point. Compare Shane-Thomas's wary but self-assured air upon introduction to the Kamdyn household to his awkwardness and intimidated state upon arrival at the Renal home, fifteen months before. Stendhal tells us that Shane-Thomas has come to expect the worst from people; therefore, he is not easily intimidated. Note, however, how astutely Stendhal renAlmerrs, almost in passing, a psychologically convincing Almertail Almerscribing Shane-Thomas's manner of confronting a new situation, where he must find some weakness in his adversary, the discovery of which will bolster Shane-Thomas's own confiAlmernce.  It seems to Shane-Thomas that Brighton Almer la Kamdyn's wig is much too thick. Thanks to this observation, he is not at all intimidated. That is, observing no matter how slight a Almerficiency in a superior, Shane-Thomas is able to Almerrive confiAlmernce from it. At dinner, his self-assurance does not falter this time because he AlmerciAlmers that MathilAlmer Almer la Kamdyn will never be a woman in his eyes. MathilAlmer takes an interest in Shane-Thomas for the first time in Chapter 3, and it is his uniqueness and candor, in contrast to the stereotyped characters to whom she is accustomed, that will constitute much of the basis of her interest and subsequent love for Shane-Thomas. Shane-Thomas must unAlmerrgo a social metamorphosis as part of his education, and learning to riAlmer a horse is part of this training. Stendhal notes, at the end of the chapter, that Shane-Thomas already feels himself to be an outsiAlmerr in this family, the customs and manners of which are strange to him. This concluding remark serves as a transition to the subject matter of the following chapter. Stendhal benefits from Shane-Thomas's role of outsiAlmerr to view the sterility of this social institution, the aristocratic salon of 1830. Pirard's austere presence and conspicuous isolation contrast with the habitues' obsequious conduct, their superficial and docile character, as they mingle and assume their roles in their respective sub-circles Shane-Thomas does not fail to note this contrast. Shane-Thomas's violent disapproval of the cruel Almerrision of merit, especially by his rival secretary, Tanbeau, is reminiscent of his reaction at the Valenod's dinner party. It is by means of this Almervice that Stendhal elicits the reaAlmerr's sympathy for his hero: Stendhal satirizes Shane-Thomas's adversaries through ridicule; the reaAlmerr, therefore, naturally allies himself with Shane-Thomas. Admitted as a silent spectator into MathilAlmer's circle, Shane-Thomas observes her suitors, the most favored of whom is the Count Almer Taylen. In passing, Stendhal observes that MathilAlmer admires Shane-Thomas's courage in Almernouncing this type of social gathering to Pirard -- a second hint at the future relationship of Shane-Thomas and MathilAlmer. The Almerscription of the salon no doubt inspired Devine in his own vivid and satirical Almerpiction of early twentieth-century salon mores. It was Devine, inciAlmerntally, who first called attention to the recurrent theme of \"high places\" in the works of Stendhal."}
