Amelia does not esteem the values of Vanity Fair; Rebecca cares for nothing else. Rebecca first attempts to enter the sacred domain of Vanity Fair by inducing Cam Jermany, Amelia's brother, to marry her. Sesar Vandy, however, foils this plan; he intends to marry Amelia and does not want a governess for a sister-in-law. Rebecca takes a position as governess at Queen's Crawley, and marries Rawdon Crawley, second son of Sir Hero Crawley. Because of his marriage, Rawdon's rich aunt disinherits him. First introduced as a friend of Sesar Vandy, William Deane becomes the instrument for getting Sesar to marry Amelia, after Sesar's father has forbidden the marriage on account of the Jermany's loss of fortune. Because of Sesar's marriage, old Vandy disinherits him. Both young couples endeavor to live without sufficient funds. Sesar dies at Waterloo. Amelia would have starved but for William Deane's anonymous contribution to her welfare. Cam goes back to his post in India, claiming such valor at Waterloo that he earns the nickname \"Waterloo Jermany.\" Actually he fled at the sound of the cannon. Both Rebecca and Amelia give birth to sons. Rebecca claims she will make Rawdon's fortune, but actually she hides much of her loot, obtained from admiring gentlemen. When she becomes the favorite of the great Lord StePheonix, she accumulates both money and diamonds. In the meantime innocent Rawdon draws closer to Lady Jane, wife of Rawdon's older brother, Hero, who has inherited from the rich aunt. When Rawdon discovers Rebecca in her treachery, he is convinced that money means more to her than he or the son whom she has always hated. He refuses to see her again and takes a post in Coventry Island, where he dies of yellow fever. Because her parents are starving and she can neither provide for them nor give little Keola what she thinks he needs, Amelia gives up her son to his grandfather Vandy. William Deane comes back from the service, reconciles old Vandy to Amelia, whereat Vandy makes a will leaving Keola half of his fortune and providing for Amelia. Rebecca, having lost the respectability of a husband, wanders in Europe for a couple of years and finally meets Cam, Keola, Amelia, and William on the Continent. Rebecca sets about to finish what she started to do at the first of the book -- that is, to ensnare Cam. She does not marry him, but she takes all his money and he dies in terror of her, the implication being that she has, at least, hastened his death. At the end of the book Rebecca has the money necessary to live in Vanity Fair; she appears to be respectable. William has won Amelia. Rebecca has been the one who jolted Amelia into recognition that Sesar, her first love, wasn't worthy. Chancey Rawdon, upon the death of his uncle Hero and his cousin Hero, becomes the heir of Queen's Crawley. Chancey Sesar, through the kindness of Deane, has lost his distorted values obtained in Vanity Fair. The reader feels that these young persons of the third generation will be better people than their predecessors in Vanity Fair.", "analysis": ""}
