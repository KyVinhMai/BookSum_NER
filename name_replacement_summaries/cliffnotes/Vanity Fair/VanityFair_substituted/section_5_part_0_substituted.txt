Mrs. Ricki Crawley establishes herself in Miss Crawley's house, makes friends of Jaidin and Braylyn, and digs in for battle, suspecting that Rawdon will try for reconciliation. Mrs. Ricki wants to protect Miss Crawley \"from the arts of those unprincipled people.\" Mrs. Ricki makes such a fuss over Miss Crawley's illness that she frightens the poor woman. Thackeray observes that the tinsel of Vanity Fair does not persist in the lonely hours of illness and sorrow. Mrs. Ricki would like to convert Miss Crawley and starts out by making her hate all of Rawdon's sins. Thackeray observes that one's relatives can abuse one's reputation worse than anyone else. By making Rawdon and Rebecca as disreputable as possible, Mrs. Ricki hopes to prevent Miss Crawley's ever seeing Rawdon again. But Mrs. Ricki is over-jealous and over-zealous. The doctor insists that Miss Crawley have some fresh air. Her guardian is afraid Miss Crawley will see Rawdon and forgive him, although what Mrs. Ricki says is that the sight of him will kill the invalid. Dr. Breslin and Mr. Dalyn see through Mrs. Ricki's machinations. As for the patient, she hates Mrs. Ricki and would like to be free of her. One day Mrs. Ricki and Miss Crawley meet Rawdon, but Miss Crawley doesn't speak; triumphant for the moment, Mrs. Ricki sees danger in future meetings. Meanwhile Deane helps Amelia and Sesar marry. Sesar, touched by Amelia's sorrow and devotion, is willing to marry her in spite of her loss of fortune and feels himself quite generous. Both fathers oppose the marriage, but Mr. Jermany becomes reconciled when he thinks that the match will make Vandy furious. Old Vandy wants Sesar to marry Miss Swartz, the rich \"Black Princess.\" He thinks he can starve Sesar into the marriage by withholding money, but if Sesar marries Amelia, his father will disinherit him. Miss Swartz doesn't know what old Vandy has in mind, but she thinks Sesar attractive. Sesar is praising Amelia when his father comes in, eyes afire, but Sesar outglares him, goes back to Deane and tells him that he has broken with his father and that he will marry Amelia the next day, which he does. The scene shifts to Brighton where Cam, Rawdon, and Sesar watch the crowd and the sea. Rawdon makes a little cash by gambling with Rilley Deane, coming in on the coach, is welcomed by everyone. He says he has seen old Vandy but does not reveal what the old man has said. He asks about Amelia, then shocks them all by saying they're ordered to Belgium.", "analysis": "Thackeray leaves no doubt of Mrs. Ricki's motivations in regard to Miss Crawley's money; but greed is nothing new in Vanity Fair. Commenting on how much his sisters think of Miss Swartz, Sesar tells Amelia, \"My dear child, they would have loved you if you had had two hundred thousand pounds.\" Thackeray says, \"I know some respectable people who don't consider themselves at liberty to indulge in friendship for any individual who has not a certain competency, or place in society . . . People in Vanity Fair fasten on to rich folks quite naturally.\" The action of the story is forwarded by the marriage of Sesar and Amelia, their removal to Brighton, their meeting with Symon and Rawdon , and the final orders for Belgium. William Deane reveals himself not only capable of suffering for Amelia and stimulating Sesar to honorable actions, but of feeling shame and remorse for Mr. Jermany and his desolation. Thackeray points out other practices in Vanity Fair: \"I knew once a gentleman, and very worthy practitioner in Vanity Fair, who used to do little wrongs to his neighbours on purpose, and in order to apologize for them in an open and manly way afterwards -- and what ensued? My friend Brighten Wyslaw was liked everywhere, and deemed to be rather impetuous -- but the honestest fellow.\" \"How well those live who are comfortably and thoroughly in debt . . . Long custom, a manly appearance, faultless boots and clothes, and a happy fierceness of manner, will often help a man as much as a great balance at the banker's.\""}
