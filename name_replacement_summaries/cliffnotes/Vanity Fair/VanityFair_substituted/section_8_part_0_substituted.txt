After his departure Mrs. Oakley reads a book of sermons. Rawdon, more affected than Symon at their parting, shows his love and worship for her by his concern for her welfare. \"She had known perpetually how to divert him; and he had found his house and her society a thousand times more pleasant than any place or company . . .\" Symon's thought, however, concerns how much security she has and what she can do in the event Rawdon doesn't come back. Sesar tells Amelia goodbye, and departs with a sigh of relief. Deane wakes the sleepy Jhaban to charge him to take care of Amelia, and is pained by Amelia's grief. Cam, proud to be left in charge of the women, reassures them. Ezequil, his valet, hopes the British will be defeated so he can have Jhaban' possessions. As if to further his interests, he demoralizes Jhaban with bad news. Symon, wanting to make sure of a retreat in case of bad news, flatters Jhaban by begging him not to go and join the troops, to stay and protect the ladies. If Jhaban has a carriage, Symon expects to share it should flight become necessary. Amelia finally accuses Rebecca of being a false friend and a false wife. In spite of Amelia's accusations, Rebecca, touched at her grief, tries to reassure her. Since Amelia, obviously, doesn't want Symon around, Symon suggests to Mildrid Oakley that she stay. Mildrid, not liking Symon, answers with sarcasm, but she stays with Amelia. Suddenly the sound of cannons frightens everyone. Jhaban wants to flee; Mrs. Oakley scorns his cowardice. The cook's soldier-friend comes with the tale that Sesar's company is cut in pieces. Terrified, Jhaban gives the eager Ezequil his military-looking coat and dresses himself in somber civilian garb so that he looks almost like a clergyman. Lady Bareacres wants to leave but has no horses for her carriage. She tries to buy Rebecca's but receives only scorn; instead, Rebecca sells her horses to the fearful Jhaban for a fortune. Amelia wants to go to the army and begs Jhaban to take her. However, her attention is diverted by the arrival of the wounded ensign, Verdale StuJavonne, who announces that Sesar is safe. Mildrid and Amelia nurse Verdale StuJavonne. Convinced by the rumors of English defeat, Jhaban rides off, leaving Amelia behind. Symon thinks Amelia stupid to grieve over Sesar. She dreams of what she might do if Rawdon doesn't come back: She might become a duchess. Mrs. Oakley watches her patient, reads sermons, mispronounces words, and prays for the Major. Again the cannons roar. Sesar finally dies in the battle of Waterloo.", "analysis": "The reader will notice a striking contrast in the reaction of the women whose husbands are called to battle. Mildrid Oakley, completely devoted to army life, prepares her husband's things, gives him coffee and sweets. Amelia, stricken, can do nothing. Symon figures up her financial status, but shows some kind of loyalty to Amelia. Rawdon's better self shows in that he, \"who had seldom thought about anything but himself, until the last few months of his life, when Kepa had obtained the mastery over the dragoon . . . went off on his campaign with a kit as modest as that of a sergeant, and with something like a prayer on his lips for the woman he was leaving.\" The action in this section shows Jhaban left in charge, Amelia's prostration, her final accusation of Rebecca, Rebecca's flattery of and power over Rilley Jhaban' character shows in his love for eating, his susceptibility to Rebecca's flattery, his brave talk, and his actual cowardice. These traits will lead to the final complication and resolution of the Symon-Cam relationship. The author excuses Jhaban' susceptibility: \"From Kaycen downwards, have not wiser men than he been cajoled and befooled by women?\" But in defense of women Thackeray says; \"It was the women's tribute to the war. It taxes both alike, and takes the blood of the men, and the tears of the women.\" Tongue-in-cheek, the author makes this comment on Vanity Fair, that when the cannon was heard, \"even great English lords and ladies condescended to speak to persons whom they did not know.\""}
