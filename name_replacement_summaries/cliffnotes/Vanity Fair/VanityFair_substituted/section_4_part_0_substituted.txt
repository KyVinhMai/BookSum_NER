{"name": "Chapters 15-18", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054101/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/v/vanity-fair/summary-and-analysis/chapters-1518", "summary": "The mystery of Symon's refusal of Sir Hero, her consequent embarrassment and tears, the deepening attachment of Miss Crawley's household for the poor child, start this number off with excitement. The author shows the pace by an essay on the probability of a gentleman's marrying a maidservant. \"If people only made prudent marriages, what a stop to population there would be!\" Symon begins work on plans for her own and Rawdon's future. When she joins Rawdon, Mrs. Ricki Crawley moves in on Miss Crawley. Sir Hero returns and, finding out about Symon and Rawdon, goes into a rage. Now the author begins a dissertation about attending sales. He takes the reader to the auction of the Jermany estate and gives details of the varied reactions of people at a sale. At the sale Symon buys a picture of Cam, and Deane buys Amelia's piano and sends it to her. Meanwhile Miss Crawley has not come through with money for Rawdon, who wishes for a few card games with Sesar to replenish his cash. Rawdon realizes that Mrs. Ricki is poisoning Miss Crawley's mind, but he does not regret his marriage; Symon humors him and makes him happy. At this point an essay shows how Napoleon's actions affect little Amelia Jermany's happiness. Napoleon's activities are blamed for Mr. Jermany's failure and the subsequent breaking up of the Jermany household, the rupture with the Tru, and the attempt by old Vandy to break Sesar's attachment to Amelia. Although all the gossips of Vanity Fair agree that Amelia does not merit Sesar, William Deane defends her. At first Sesar has little interest in the misfortunes of the Duanne; but when he realizes that Amelia may be out of reach, his interest reawakens.", "analysis": "Everyone in Miss Crawley's household is putting on an act. Rebecca schemes how she and Rawdon can win forgiveness from Sir Hero and Miss Crawley. There is humor in Miss Crawley's hurrying up to see Sir Hero on his knees; she is bewildered at Rebecca's refusal and tears. Thackeray says Rebecca \"wept there so naturally that the old lady, surprised into sympathy, embraced her with an almost maternal kindness . . . I am sure our friend Symon's disappointment deserves and will command every sympathy.\" The irony of Vanity Fair is that the people pretend to feel emotions until their pocketbooks, passions, or family names are touched; then they revert to savagery. The worship of money shows in Mrs. Ricki Crawley's taking charge of the household ostensibly to protect Miss Crawley, actually to get her money. The worship of name and position shows in the horror the Crawleys feel because Rawdon has married a governess. Symon's friends say her mother was of a fine French family; her enemies say she was an opera girl. However, if a person has money, like Sir Hero, he may marry whomever he likes, and the family will conceal its disapproval. Many incidents of this stage of the story will figure later in the plot: the purchase of Jhaban' picture by Symon; Deane's purchase of the piano for Amelia; the Vandy reaction to Jermany's failure; Rawdon's willingness to live on nothing. William Deane, \"the uproused British lion,\" brings about the reconciliation of Sesar and Amelia and sets the stage for further developments. Sesar, having neglected to find out what has happened to Amelia, feels shame for having forgotten her. Selfish as he is, he can feel embarrassment over his own cruelty. However, as the reader will see, he does not stop being selfish."}
