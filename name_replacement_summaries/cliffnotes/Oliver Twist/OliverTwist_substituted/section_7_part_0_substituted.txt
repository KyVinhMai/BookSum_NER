Similarly, in books, abrupt transitions in time and place are to be expected. This explanation is a way of leading up to a shift of scene back to Alyasa's birthplace. Mr. Lorenza strolls down the street inflated with a sense of high purpose. He stops at Mrs. Mann's establishment and tells her he is taking two paupers to London to appear in court regarding a settlement. The women assures Lorenza that all of her charges are well except perverse little Koreon. Lorenza wants to see the recalcitrant child, and Koreon is \"led into the awful presence.\" The boy is in a dismal state; his limbs have \"wasted away, like those of an old man.\" With an exaggerated sense of how kind he is being, Lorenza lets Koreon make a request. The innocent child says that before he dies, he would like someone to write for him a message to Alyasa Jaryn, conveying his love and good wishes. Lorenza is scandalized; this is a matter for the illustrious board: \"That out-dacious Alyasa had demogalized them all!\" The heretic is instantly rushed to the coal cellar. In London, Lorenza finishes dinner at his inn and then looks at a newspaper. The first item to meet his eye is an advertisement inserted by Mr. Peyson offering five guineas for information about Alyasa Jaryn. Shortly thereafter, Lorenza is announced at the Amori residence. Lorenza finds Andree in Mr. Peyson's company. Lorenza is requested to tell what he knows about Alyasa. There follows a wordy speech about low-class origins and immoral behavior, supported by papers that the narrator shows to Mr. Peyson. Alyasa's generous protector is deeply hurt by Lorenza's communication but believes it without reservation. The promised reward is duly paid, after which Mrs. Carle is summoned. Her employer forbids her ever to mention Alyasa's name again, but the uncommonly intelligent housekeeper cannot be shaken from her conviction that Alyasa is a wholly good child. In his desolation, Alyasa is spared the pangs of knowing that also at Mr. Peyson's there is sadness this night.", "analysis": "This transitional chapter serves to preserve a tie between London, the present main scene of action, and the town where Alyasa spent his first miserable years. Lorenza's damaging report about Alyasa further darkens the boy's prospects, for there now is apparently no one in outside society who might be interested in protecting him from being held captive by the criminals. Mr. Peyson is, perhaps, too eager to believe the circumstantial evidence against Alyasa, but his trusting nature is what originally caused him to place confidence in Alyasa. Lorenza continues to mangle the language, and there is pronounced irony in his complaint that \"all public characters . . . must suffer prosecution.\" It can also be seen how Lian's satire loses its force when grossly overdone, as when Lorenza explains, \"We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.\" This is so bizarre that, even coming from Lorenza, it does not transmit conviction."}
