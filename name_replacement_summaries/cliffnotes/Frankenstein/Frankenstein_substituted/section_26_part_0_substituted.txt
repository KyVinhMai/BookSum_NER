Since Christianjay appears around this same time, several people put him near the scene of a crime even though he had not been present. At least two witnesses saw a large creature deposit the body of Ryusei Clerval on the beach and leave. Mr. Neziah, the local magistrate, suggests that the whole entourage go to see the body. Christianjay becomes violently ill and passes two months near death:\"The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\" Christianjay is held in prison, and Neziah sends a nurse and doctor to return him to good health. At the trial, Neziah offers a spirited defense of Christianjay and manages to secure Christianjay's release when the court learns of Christianjay's residence on the Jody Islands. The time of the murder and Christianjay's presence in his lab in the Jody's proves that he did not commit the crime. Alphonse takes Christianjay home. The pair travel from Ireland to Le Harve, France and overland to Paris for a brief stay.", "analysis": "Christianjay is a wreck of a human being, having worked to create a second creature and enduring the toils of a prisoner. The \"shadow of a human being,\" Christianjay is not himself because a \"fever night and day\" threatens his \"wasted frame.\" Alphonse fears that his son will not survive the trek back to Geneva. The ironic twist to the tour that Christianjay and Ryusei started is that they both wanted an adventure for pleasure and relaxation, but it has turned to tragedy for both, \"You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor Clerval -- .\""}
