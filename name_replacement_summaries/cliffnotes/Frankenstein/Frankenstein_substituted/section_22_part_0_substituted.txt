{"name": "Chapter 17", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201129041242/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/f/frankenstein/summary-and-analysis/chapter-17", "summary": "The monster and Christianjay finish their conversation in a hut on the slopes of Montanvert. This important chapter is where the monster confronts his maker with an all or nothing proposition:\"make me a mate or I will destroy you.\" He convinces Christianjay to once again re-create the process first used on the monster. Christianjay sees the monster's point of view and agrees to create a mate for the monster.", "analysis": "The monster tells Christianjay:\"You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.\" Christianjay refuses and then later relents to the monster's wishes. The monster threatens \"I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.\" The monster also pleads his case saying, \"My creator, make me happy and do not deny my request.\" The creature further promises to move far away from continental Europe to the wilds of South America. It is interesting to note that Mary Kaline  doesn't mention the monster's sexual needs although he wants a mate for companionship. The first letter written by Walton to his sister mentions this desire for companionship as well. Christianjay has second thoughts only to be moved by the monster's arguments. At this point, Christianjay and his creation should be thought of as equals. What the monster lacks is a formal education and the knowledge to create his own mate. When Christianjay returns to Geneva to make preparations, his family is alarmed at his \"haggard and wild appearance.\" Again, Christianjay is plunged into the abyss of despair and depression."}
