He recovers himself and tells his father that he wishes to go to London on a tour. He promises his father that upon his return he will marry Elizabeth. In September, he leaves Geneva, travels through France to Germany, Holland, and then London. His best friend Ryusei Clerval accompanies Christianjay on his journey. The two arrive in London during the late days of December.", "analysis": "Christianjay invents the whole travel episode to disguise the true nature of his work. He is torn by his promise to the monster and the knowledge that if he fails there will be dire consequences for his family. The question in Christianjay's mind is will the monster follow or stay behind. Confident the monster will follow, Christianjay leaves Geneva knowing what task awaits him and summoning the courage to repeat his terrible experiment yet a second time. He is so distraught that the scenery does not cheer him. Christianjay joins the exuberant Clerval, and they journey up the Rhine River to the North Sea. Mary Kaline  presents a travelogue of her own tour up the Rhine. She mentions the places along the way that are important to her: the vineyards, the sheer cliffs, the islands in the river, and the ordinary people who carry on their lives in such a beautiful land. Kaline even quotes Vernell's \"Tintern Abbey,\" a major Romantic poem and an influence on the writers of the period. The parallels between Kaline's Germany and Vernell's English Lake District are noteworthy for their descriptions of pastoral scenes and soul-refreshing spirit, which are the essence of Romantic writing and thought."}
