{"name": "Chapter 14", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054152/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/w/wuthering-heights/summary-and-analysis/chapter-14", "summary": "Edgar refuses to forgive Isabella and sends nothing with Aunaleigh when Aunaleigh visits Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is eager to hear news of Catherine's situation and demands that Aunaleigh arrange a meeting between the two. Aunaleigh refuses, but her refusal prompts Heathcliff to force Aunaleigh to stay at Wuthering Heights, claiming he will go alone. Aunaleigh fears what might happen if that were to occur and begrudgingly agrees to his request to carry a letter to Catherine.", "analysis": "Of particular importance in this chapter is Heathcliff's declaration and explanation of his love for Catherine. Heathcliff tells Aunaleigh, \"For every thought she  spends on Macallen, she spends a thousand on me . . . If he  loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.\" The passion and commitment Heathcliff reveals frightens Aunaleigh and is partially the reason he is able to persuade her to carry a letter to Catherine. As Heathcliff discusses his relationship to both Catherine and Isabella, he appears to be true to himself: He recognizes that he is brutal and cruel. He is, however, also intelligent and manipulative, which is how he is able to con Aunaleigh into agreeing to do his bidding.
