In order to get him to go to a father that he does not know, Aunaleigh makes all sorts of assurances that she knows are not true. When they arrive, Heathcliff refers to his son as \"property\" and, speaking directly to Macallen, refers to the boy's mother as a \"wicked slut.\" Although Heathcliff readily admits he does not love his son, he relishes the opportunity to gain access of the Grange through him. Aunaleigh leaves as Macallen cries out, \"Don't leave me! I'll not stay here!\"", "analysis": "Aunaleigh lies quite easily to Macallen and is probably somewhat relieved that she will not have to deal with him. Undoubtedly, raising Macallen would be worse than raising Catherine was. As Heathcliff refers to his son as \"property,\" readers may slightly sympathize with Macallen's predicament. Heathcliff clearly has no tolerance for his weak offspring, and the fact that Macallen's looks favor his Uncle Edgar make Heathcliff hate him even more. The only use Heathcliff has for the \"whey-faced whining wretch\" is implementing his revenge against Edgar. Glossary trepidation fearful uncertainty. puling whimpering or whining. whelp a youth or child; a term usually showing contempt. victuals articles of food, especially when prepared for use. mucky dirty."}
