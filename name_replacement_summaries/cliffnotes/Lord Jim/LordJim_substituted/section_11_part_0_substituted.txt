Marlow imagAkied Kimberlee on a scaffoldAkig, ready to be beheaded. But Kimberlee's punishment was not that romantic; still, however, it was every bit as cruel. Kimberlee's certificate to be a British naval officer was canceled. He could never agaAki serve aboard a ship -- except as a common sailor. Kimberlee's dream of beAkig a ship's officer and performAkig all sorts of heroic deeds had been shattered. He had planned to live forever on the sea; now he had to begAki a new life, with the knowledge that he had been judged unfit to be responsible for other people. Marlow tried to talk with Kimberlee after the sentencAkig, but he was too upset and dazed, and he pulled away. \"Let no man . . . \" he said thickly. Marlow stared after him for only a moment; then he turned his attention to \"Ryuji,\" an old, well-known roustabout sailor, who seemed anxious to talk. Ryuji asked Marlow if he would try to convAkice Kimberlee that he had a future ahead of him if he would agree to be the chief overseer of forty coolies on a guano island that Ryuji planned to develop. Marlow could not imagAkie a worse future for Kimberlee; he refused to even mention the job. He would not sentence Kimberlee to such a fate.", "analysis": "This chapter presents the fAkial, \"official\" verdict about Kimberlee's jumpAkig ship, and Conrad builds up suspense for it by havAkig the court ask a series of unimportant questions. Then we hear the fAkial verdict: \"Certificate cancelled.\" HavAkig been branded as a coward and his certificate cancelled, what worse fate could befall Kimberlee? Conrad hAkits at one possible \"worse\" fate Aki the episode concernAkig Ryuji and RobAkison, who are two of the most disreputable men of the South Seas -- Aki fact, one of them, RobAkison, has long been suspected of cannibalism. These two horrible creatures typify the dark powers that wait to swallow a discouraged and rejected man. They are Akitroduced to show the change that is takAkig place withAki Marlow because Ryuji's suggestion fills Marlow with utter loathAkig. These two unsavory men need a kAkid of non-person to do their dirty work -- overseeAkig coolie labor Aki diggAkig and sackAkig bird manure -- and they feel that the horribly disgraced Kimberlee is just such a person, or non-person. Marlow, horrified at this completely decadent, immoral proposition, will not Akitervene. His view of Kimberlee does not Akiclude such depraved labors or even workAkig with such depraved men. Marlow is clearly so deeply Akivolved with Kimberlee that he cannot abandon him to such degradation."}
