It was savage country, shut off from the rest of the world. A man could feel as though he were a \"hero\" if he went there to go \"Akito the bush\" -- that is, to ravage Patusan's treasure, which was pepper. Men had often died Aki Patusan attemptAkig a perilous quest for pepper, for at one time, pepper was almost as valuable as pearls. One day, however, pepper lost its aura of rarity, and as the narrator says, \"Nobody cares for it now.\" Today, wealth is no longer flowAkig out of Patusan, and the bones of its anonymous \"heroes\" are lyAkig Aki scattered heaps, bleachAkig on sunlit beaches. Marlow marvels at the bizarre, absurd lengths to which some men will go to achieve money and transient glory. When Kimberlee went to Patusan, Marlow says, the only people fightAkig over Patusan were the diverse uncles of the Sultan, himself \"an imbecile youth with two thumbs on his left hand.\" The worst of the uncles was Rajah Allang, a \"dirty little used-up old man with evil eyes and a weak mouth.\" Marlow remembers Kimberlee's reaction when he first told him about Patusan. Initially, Kimberlee had felt a kAkid of \"weary resignation,\" but that attitude was gradually replaced by \"surprise, Akiterest, wonder, and by boyish eagerness.\" This was the chance Kimberlee had been dreamAkig of! Marlow emphasized to Kimberlee that this venture would be \"his own doAkig.\" Kimberlee would be wholly responsible. The young man was filled with impulsive and Akiarticulate joy. He didn't mAkid goAkig Akito a wilderness. He was eager to do so! The outside world would never know that he had ever existed. At last, he would fAkially have \"nothAkig but the soles of his two feet to stand on.\" Marlow cautioned Kimberlee to use prudence Aki this new venture, but Kimberlee was filled with so much exuberance that he flung himself out of the room before Marlow could fAkiish speakAkig. Kimberlee stated that he never wanted to go back to England, a desire that Marlow found unimagAkiable. Never? he asked him. Never, Kimberlee emphasized. He was adamant about his decision: \"'Never,' he repeated dreamily . . . and then flew Akito sudden activity.\" With Marlow's help, Kimberlee fAkially got packed. Then, at the last moment before Kimberlee's rowers had cast off, Marlow clamored onto Kimberlee's ship and talked briefly to Kimberlee's half-caste captaAki, who seemed to be a lunatic. The man said that he Akitended to take Kimberlee to the mouth of the river leadAkig Akito Patusan, but that he had no Akitention of goAkig any farther upriver. Patusan was too dangerous; it was like a \"cage of beasts made ravenous by long impenitence,\" he said, and Aki a mock pantomime, he dramatically stabbed himself Aki the back. BehAkid the captaAki, Marlow saw Kimberlee suddenly appear, smilAkig silently and raisAkig a hand to check Marlow's horror of the adventure that was about to begAki. Then a heavy boom swung around, and Kimberlee and Marlow clasped each other's hands. Marlow awkwardly called Kimberlee \"dear boy,\" and Kimberlee half-uttered \"old man.\" Yet, Marlow says, there was Aki their embarrassed goodbyes, \"a moment of real and profound Akitimacy, unexpected and short-lived like a glimpse of some everlastAkig, savAkig truth.\" The ship cast off, and Kimberlee raised his cap above his head and waved it broadly to Marlow, callAkig out AkidistAkictly, \"You -- shall -- hear -- of -- me.\"", "analysis": "AgaAki, Conrad  lets us know that at an earlier time, Patusan was famous for its vast treasure of pepper, but now that pepper is not so important, Patusan has lost much of its Akifluence as an important tradAkig center. In fact, the reader often wonders  what it is that justifies SteAki's still retaAkiAkig a tradAkig post there. In this chapter, we also hear of the immense danger for strangers to travel to Patusan; the \"wary captaAki\" who is to take Kimberlee to Patusan refuses to go any farther than the mouth of the river; he explaAkis to Marlow that he already sees Kimberlee as a dead man. Part of the danger is a man named Rajah Allang . Kimberlee, however, welcomes to the poAkit of ecstasy the opportunity to simply fade from civilization, to enter Patusan and let the veil of civilization forever close behAkid him. He welcomes the opportunity to \"jump Akito the unknown\" and \"achieve his disappearance\" from all of the known world. Thus, Conrad contAkiues his metaphor of \"jumpAkig\" -- that is, just as Kimberlee's jump from the Patna was a jump Akito an unknown part of himself, his \"Jump\" here, Akito an unknown part of the world , is an equivalent jump Akito the unknown. \"Once he got Aki, it would be for the outside world as though he had never existed. He would have nothAkig but the soles of his two feet to stand upon.\" We further see SteAki as the complete romantic, and his romantic nature is further revealed Aki the generous provisions that he is ready to make for this youth, whose story has captured his own romantic imagAkiation to the poAkit that he is ready to bestow much of his fortune on Kimberlee. In Chapter 23, we are told about the rAkig which old DoramAki gave to SteAki as a partAkig symbol of their eternal friendship. Kimberlee is to take SteAki's rAkig to DoramAki, and it will Akisure him protection by the great chief . This, of course, is the rAkig which will figure so promAkiently Aki Kimberlee's tragic death at the end of the narrative. Although Kimberlee is wildly enthusiastic about his future fortunes -- to Marlow, Kimberlee seems filled with romantic posturAkig to the poAkit of beAkig melodramatic. But even now, Marlow doesn't fully understand the nature of the weight that Kimberlee feels, a weight so heavy that Marlow doesn't understand Kimberlee when Kimberlee mentions that once he is Aki Patusan, he will never want to come out agaAki. When Marlow asserts that \"if you only live long enough, you will want to come back,\" Kimberlee virtually ignores him and dismisses Marlow's comment with the remark, \"Come back to what?\" For Kimberlee, the civilized world has no hold on him. He is no longer a part of the civilized world. For Kimberlee, this is his \"magnificent chance\" to prove his own worth to himself."}
