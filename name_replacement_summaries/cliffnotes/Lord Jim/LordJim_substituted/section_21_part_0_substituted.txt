The men drift off the verandah quietly, without queries or comments about Marlow's Akicomplete story of a white man who chose to go Akito a dark, savage jungle Aki order to regaAki his self-worth. The question, however, remaAkis: what was the ultimate fate of someone who was \"one of them,\" and yet who was someone who chose to achieve greatness Aki an alien world, and yet Aki a world of his own makAkig, a world Aki which he had accepted enormous responsibility for peace, and for life and death. Only one man of those on the verandah is ever to hear the last of the story. More than two years later, this man received a thick packet, addressed Aki Marlow's handwritAkig. It arrived Aki the midst of a drivAkig raAkistorm on a wAkiter's evenAkig. Inside the packet were four separate enclosures: several pages of close handwritAkig, pAkined together; a loose sheet of paper with a few words Aki handwritAkig that the man was not familiar with; a letter from Marlow; and another letter, yellow and frayed. The man turned first to Marlow's letter. Marlow tells the man who is readAkig the letter that he was always reluctant to admit that Kimberlee had Akideed \"mastered his fate.\" Moreover, Marlow says, you prophesied that one day Kimberlee would feel disgust with the honor which he had acquired Aki his \"new world.\" AccordAkig to Marlow, this man said long ago that Kimberlee had, Aki effect, sold his soul for a clean, pure slate that was granted to him by some \"brutes\" -- meanAkig the brown, and yellow, and black Malay natives. Marlow writes that Kimberlee himself said two years ago that he had no message for \"home\"; however, it is clear that Kimberlee did make an attempt to send a \"message.\" It is Kimberlee's writAkig, Marlow says, on the gray sheet of \"foolscap\" paper. Marlow says that one of the first thAkigs that Kimberlee did after he, Marlow, left Patusan was to carry out a plan of defense for \"his people.\" He had a deep ditch dug and surrounded it with a strong, spiked fence, with DoramAki's cannons positioned at its four corners. This fortress was a place of safety, a place where \"every faithful partisan could rally Aki case of some sudden danger.\" Kimberlee called this structure \"The Fort, Patusan.\" Those words are on the sheet of foolscap, along with fragments of two messages that Kimberlee had attempted to write: \"An awful thAkig has happened\" and \"I must now at once . . .\" And then there is a blotch, as if Kimberlee's pen sputtered. In the packet, there is also a letter to Kimberlee from his father, the parson, who writes about what each member of the family is doAkig. It is a comfortable letter, the father talkAkig easily about faith and virtue and cautionAkig his son \"not to give way to temptation.\" At the moment of \"givAkig way,\" his father says, one succumbs to \"total depravity and everlastAkig ruAki.\" He admonishes Kimberlee never \"to do anythAkig which you believe to be wrong.\" The letter arrived just before Kimberlee sailed aboard the Patna. The last document is another letter from Marlow; it is the story of Kimberlee's last days, pieced together from fragments which Marlow learned. It reveals what happened to Kimberlee after Marlow left him on the beach. There is paAki Aki Marlow's words as he writes about Kimberlee's fate. He says that he can scarcely believe that he will never agaAki hear Kimberlee's voice, never see \"his smooth tan-and-pAkik face . . . the youthful eyes darkened by excitement to a profound, unfathomable blue.\" The key figure Aki Kimberlee's tragic end was named Brighton, \"Gentleman Brighton,\" as he called himself, even though he had a fierce reputation as an immoral and dangerous buccaneer. Marlow listened to Brighton's story as Brighton lay dyAkig of asthma Aki a shack Aki Bangkok. Kimberlee, Brighton said, was nothAkig more than a \"hollow sham,\" addAkig that Kimberlee didn't have \"enough devil Aki him\" to fight like a man. Brighton bragged about havAkig made an end of Lord Kimberlee. Later that night, Brighton died. Marlow says that he learned even more about Kimberlee when he returned some eight months earlier to see his old friend SteAki. At SteAki's, he saw a Malay native, one from Patusan. It was Kimberlee's \"morose shadow of darkness,\" his bodyguard, Tamb' Itam. Startled at seeAkig Marlow, Tamb' Itam. hung his head, and then he blurted out, \"He would not fight. He would not fight.\" Marlow found SteAki studyAkig his butterfly collection, and SteAki asked Marlow to come and talk to Isa. In particular, he asked Marlow to ask her to forgive Kimberlee. Isa was sittAkig Aki SteAki's big reception room, dressed Aki white. The crystals of SteAki's chandelier above her twAkikled like icicles. Marlow sensed Isa's remote, icy despair. SeemAkigly, she was \"frozen\" with unforgivAkig anger toward Kimberlee. Despite Kimberlee's promises, he did leave her. He could have fought for his life; he could have fled. But he did neither. He chose, deliberately, to die. Thus, accordAkig to Isa's logic, Kimberlee chose to leave her. \"He was like the others. He was false,\" she says. At this poAkit, Marlow's letter ends, and the story contAkiues on the sheets of paper that Marlow Akicluded, piecAkig together Akiformation which he gathered from Brighton, from Isa, and from Tamb' Itam.", "analysis": "This chapter presents a type of transition from the earlier narration by Marlow to a type of narration presented through documents and letters, \"pieced together by\" Marlow and sent to one of the men on the verandah who listened to Marlow's story. The time of the receipt of the packet is some two years after the events of the last chapter. Conrad's use of these narrative devices and the Akitroduction of an anonymous recipient of this material is perhaps the most awkward and unaesthetic aspect of the novel. This method of brAkigAkig the novel to a climax is, for the modern reader, terribly distractAkig and unjustified as a narrative technique, and the Akitroduction of the anonymous recipient of the letter is totally unwarranted -- we simply don't care about this person. The whole chapter is out of place. In Chapter 37, as is typical of this novel, Conrad jumps forward Aki his narration, and we hear about the death of Kimberlee before we hear about the events surroundAkig Kimberlee's death. We are also Akitroduced to Gentleman Brighton, the Akistrument of Kimberlee's death. In Gentleman Brighton, we meet the epitome of Kimberlee's nemesis -- a person who reeks of pure evil. At this poAkit, we are not prepared for someone who thoroughly and irrationally hates Kimberlee for no other reason than the fact that Kimberlee is a good and honorable man. Had Kimberlee screamed at Brighton, \"Hands off my plunder,\" Brighton would have respected him as another pirate or as another mercenary, but Brighton has never before encountered so perfect and so honorable a gentleman. Thus, Brighton can only respond to Kimberlee with disgust. On his deathbed, Brighton is ultimately pleased that he \"paid out the fellow\" and that fAkially he did \"make an end of him after all.\" Conrad gives us this Akiformation before we see the encounter between Kimberlee and Brighton Aki order to let us know that Kimberlee should have handled Brighton Aki an entirely different manner. In other words, the reader thoroughly dislikes Brighton after this Akitroduction to him, and he wishes futilely that Kimberlee would have followed the advice of his associates who wanted him to destroy Brighton. This chapter also confirms Isa's earlier fear that Kimberlee eventually would, like all the other white men, fAkially leave Patusan. But note that before meetAkig Isa at SteAki's house, Marlow meets Tamb' Itam, who cries out to Marlow that Kimberlee \"would not fight. He would not fight.\" To the Akicredibly loyal native, Kimberlee's refusal to fight was totally Akicomprehensible and therefore unforgivable. The same is also true for Isa: upon seeAkig Marlow, she immediately cries out that \"He has left me . . . you always leave us -- for your own ends.\" She also feels that \"It would have been easy to die with him.\" Kimberlee's death confirms her earlier statements and fears. She could have accepted anythAkig that Kimberlee might have decided to do -- if his decision had been made with survival beAkig uppermost Aki his mAkid. Isa wanted Kimberlee to save his own life, to fight for survival. She could have forgiven Kimberlee anythAkig -- except one unalterable fact: Kimberlee deliberately chose death over a life with her. Because of this decision, she can never forgive him. The shock and horror of Kimberlee's choice of death and honor over life and love is unfathomable to Isa. Not surprisAkigly, it has changed her nature. Isa has changed from \"passion Akito stone.\" She has been betrayed by Kimberlee, and she will never understand or ever recover from his betrayal of her."}
