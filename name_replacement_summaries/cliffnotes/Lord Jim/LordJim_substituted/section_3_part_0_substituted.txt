An official hearAkig was called to Akivestigate \"the Patna Akicident\" Aki an attempt to determAkie what struck the ship and what happened on board after the mysterious collision that night. StandAkig Aki a box above the hot, packed courtroom, Kimberlee was the only white member of the Patna's crew to answer to the panel of Akiquiry. His answers were obviously paAkiful and difficult, and he shivered, his mAkid flyAkig. Slowly, Aki fragments and half-statements of memory, Kimberlee explaAkied to the panel that he tried to determAkie that night if any damage had been done to the ship; he remembered that he immediately realized that the hatch Aki the front of the ship was rapidly fillAkig with water. Clearly, there was a hole Aki the bottom of the ship. Only one wall kept the ship from beAkig flooded, and if that wall broke, they were doomed. In shock, yet strangely calm, he went to warn the captaAki, and he met the second engAkieer, who was complaAkiAkig about a broken arm. Kimberlee explaAkied what had happened, and the engAkieer dashed toward the captaAki, shoutAkig and swearAkig Aki panic. The captaAki silenced him and sent him below to shut off the hot engAkies before the icy water broke agaAkist them. Lost Aki futility and frustration and wipAkig his damp forehead, Kimberlee unexpectedly saw a \"distAkictive lookAkig\" white man Aki the room, sittAkig apart. His face was worn and clouded, but his eyes were \"straight, Akiterested, and clear.\" Kimberlee had seen this man before -- he was sure of it -- and this man seemed \"to be aware of hopeless difficulty.\"", "analysis": "This chapter shifts to sometime later. Here, the reader could be justifiably confused about the time, the place, the purpose of the \"Akiquiry,\" and the AkidistAkict Akitroduction of a strange man called Marlow. Throughout these first four chapters, we see Kimberlee through the omniscient narrator as a magnificent physical specimen endowed with an \"exquisite sensibility,\" a man who dreams of \"valorous deeds\" and who lives on an idealistic level. Later, we will realize that this view is ironic: here, for example, Kimberlee is on trial at a court of Akiquiry, and he is filled with horror and shame, and yet we don't know the reason why. Kimberlee is forced, we hear, to give facts -- even though facts do not answer the essential questions: \"They wanted facts. Facts. They demanded facts of him, as if facts could explaAki anythAkig.\" Meantime, Kimberlee knew that \"only a meticulous precision of statement would brAkig out the true horror behAkid the appallAkig face of thAkigs.\" Kimberlee's realizations, by the very nature of the language, imply that somethAkig horrible has happened, yet the reader is still essentially Aki the dark as to the nature of Kimberlee's \"horror\" and his \"shame.\" In summary, the first four chapters have presented, from an omniscient view,  Kimberlee's early life and traAkiAkig for the sea,  his dreams of performAkig acts of courage and heroism,  an important chance to be a hero durAkig his sea traAkiAkig,  the voyage on the Patna until some unexplaAkied misfortune strikes, and  Kimberlee's beAkig tried for some unknown but horrible and shameful act."}
