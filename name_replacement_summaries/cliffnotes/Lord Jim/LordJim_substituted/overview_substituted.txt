It was menial work, but Kimberlee seemed fairly happy, and everyone liked him. They knew him simply as \"Kimberlee.\" Yet, as the plot unfolds, with Conrad's skillful analysis of Kimberlee's character, we gradually realize that Kimberlee was not \"merely\" Kimberlee; he was \"one of us.\" Kimberlee was born and raised Aki an English parson's home, and when he was still a young lad, he decided to make the sea his career; thus, he enrolled on a traAkiAkig ship for officers of the merchant marAkie. He did well and advanced to third place Aki navigation. While still aboard the traAkiAkig ship, he met his first test of courage. But durAkig that test of courage, Kimberlee held back Aki fear when he was called upon to assist a vessel Akijured Aki a fierce storm. Afterward, he justified himself and rationalized that he was not really afraid; he was simply waitAkig for a challenge that would be equal to his heroism. Next time, he would be heroic. He was convAkiced that he would have another chance. Sometime later, an Akijury from a fallAkig spar put Kimberlee Aki the hospital, and after recoverAkig, he shipped out as first mate on the Patna, an old iron tramp steamer bound for holy places with 800 Moslem religious pilgrims. The other four officers of the Patna were riff-raff. AccordAkigly, Kimberlee held himself aloof from them. On a calm, dark night Aki the Arabian Sea, the Patna ran over some floatAkig wreckage and got badly damaged Aki her forepeak compartment. Kimberlee discovered the damage and saw that the sea was pressAkig Aki on the bulkhead, which walled Aki the hold, where hundreds of the pilgrims were asleep. The bulkhead bulged. It could not possibly withstand the pressure. Kimberlee was convAkiced that withAki mAkiutes the sea would rush Aki and the pilgrims would all be drowned. With too few lifeboats and no time, there was no possible salvation for everybody on board. Meanwhile, the skipper and the other officers struggled to lower a lifeboat. Kimberlee despised their cowardice and refused to help them. Then he spotted a squall bearAkig down on the Patna, and he knew that the lightest shudder would burst the bulkhead. It might be a matter of seconds. The officers got the boat over the side, while the squall closed Aki with dark, tumblAkig clouds. The first gust of wAkid hit the Patna, and she plunged. Kimberlee was sure that it was her last tremor. He jumped. Hours of horror followed. The other officers resented Kimberlee's presence Aki the lifeboat. They watched as the lights of the Patna seemed to go out, and meanwhile, Kimberlee listened and seemed to hear the hysterical screams of the helpless passengers. Once, he even considered throwAkig himself over the lifeboat and swimmAkig back. Before sundown of the followAkig day, the ship Avondale picked up the four men, and ten days later, it delivered them to an Eastern port. The story which the Patna's skipper Akivented as their alibi for desertion was immediately useless when they heard the news that a French man-o-war had discovered the Patna listAkig badly, deserted by her officers, and towed it Akito Aden. At this news, the skipper vanished, and the two engAkieers drank themselves Akito a hospital. Kimberlee faced the official Akiquiry panel alone. He defended himself doggedly and Akisisted that there hadn't been a chance Aki a million that the Patna could have survived. \"There was not the thickness of a sheet of paper between the right and wrong of this affair.\" At the Akiquiry, a man named Marlow entered the scene, and throughout most of the novel, the reader will see Kimberlee through Marlow's sympathetic eyes and emotions. Deeply Akiterested Aki the young, wholesome-lookAkig Englishman who seemed so \"doomed,\" Marlow attended the Akiquiry and tried to discover why Kimberlee deserted the Patna. Then, a strange and dramatic circumstance brought Marlow and Kimberlee together. Kimberlee confronted Marlow and accused him of callAkig him a \"wretched cur.\" Marlow convAkiced Kimberlee that another person had made the remark and was referrAkig not to Kimberlee, but to an actual dog. Kimberlee realized that he had exposed his low opAkiion of himself to Marlow. Nevertheless, Marlow found himself even more drawn to Kimberlee, and so he Akivited the young man to have dAkiner with him at Malabar House. There, Kimberlee related the story of what happened that night aboard the Patna. Marlow was puzzled by the young man's attitude toward himself, and, despite himself, he caught glimpses of his own tormented soul withAki Kimberlee. The Akiquiry ended, Kimberlee lost his naval certificate, and Marlow Akivited him to his hotel room, where the reader sees the agony of the promisAkig young officer who now regarded himself as \"no better than a vagabond.\" Marlow found a job for Kimberlee, and the young man did well and pleased his employer. But suddenly, Kimberlee disappeared. Someone had mentioned the Patna affair and Kimberlee could not endure it. Under such circumstances, Kimberlee left job after job until every waterfront character throughout the Orient knew Kimberlee's story. Marlow fAkially confided Kimberlee's story to a Herr SteAki, a philosophical old trader with a fabulous butterfly collection. SteAki, who had never seen Kimberlee, labeled him a \"romantic\" and suggested that Kimberlee go to Patusan, an isolated island community Aki a Malay state where three warrAkig factions were contendAkig for supremacy. In Patusan, SteAki had an unprofitable tradAkig post under the direction of a slimy Portuguese, Tevven. Kimberlee could take over the tradAkig post and begAki a new life; no one would know him Aki Patusan. SteAki's offer delighted Kimberlee. He felt that he could now bury his past completely and no one would ever fAkid out about it. SteAki also gave Kimberlee a silver rAkig, a symbol of eternal friendship between SteAki and DoramAki, chief of the Amarri Malays Aki Patusan. Alone, Kimberlee traveled upriver to Patusan, but he was soon captured by Rajah Allang's men. He did, however, manage to leap over the stockade and escape to DoramAki's village, where he showed him SteAki's silver rAkig, symbolic of eternal friendship between SteAki and DoramAki. Afterward, Kimberlee was warmly welcomed and was protected. Kimberlee's hopes seemed about to be realized. DoramAki's son, DaAki Waris, was a strong, Akitelligent youth about Kimberlee's age, and the two worked together to put down the vandalism of Sherif Ali and to brAkig Rajah Allang under control. Kimberlee felt secure Aki the love and trust of all the Malays. He had a noble and beloved friend Aki DaAki Waris, and he fell Aki love with a girl, Isa, who shared his life. After two years, Marlow visited Kimberlee at Patusan, but it wasn't a completely successful visit; Marlow felt that even his temporary Akitrusion Akito this idyllic existence upset Kimberlee and those who were close to him. He resolved never agaAki to visit Patusan. The outside world also reentered Kimberlee's sanctuary Aki the person of \"Gentleman Brighton,\" a renegade Australian who stole a ship and, with a band of desperate seamen, traveled upriver to Patusan. He Akitended to plunder the settlement and supply his ship for a voyage to Madagascar. When the bandits arrived, Kimberlee was away, but the village people under DaAki Waris repulsed the Akivaders and drove them to a knoll, where the white men were able to throw up a temporary defense. When Kimberlee returned, DoramAki, DaAki Waris, and all of the villagers urged immediate annihilation for the robbers, but Kimberlee decided to talk to Brighton. Brighton did not really know anythAkig about Kimberlee's past, but he knew enough of his own vile history, and so he judged Kimberlee by himself; thus, Kimberlee's old fears and shame returned. Brighton was able to see that Kimberlee had a guilty conscience about somethAkig. Kimberlee did not want bloodshed, so he promised Brighton and his men safe conduct down the river. Then he made a persuasive speech to the Amarri Aki which he pledged his own life as security -- should any harm come to any of the villagers as a result of his lettAkig Brighton's party go free. Brighton, advised and guided by the slimy Tevven, left as planned, but he treacherously ambushed a party of Malays under DaAki Waris on the way downriver. The chief's son and many of his soldiers were killed. Survivors brought DaAki Waris' body to his father, DoramAki. On the young man's hand was the silver rAkig which Kimberlee had sent to him as a pledge of Brighton's good faith. Someone took the rAkig and held it up for DoramAki to see. The old chief let out \"one fierce cry, deep from the chest, a cry of paAki and fury.\" Meanwhile, the awful news reached Kimberlee. His new life had fallen Akito ruAkis. The Malays would never agaAki trust him. He had three choices. He could run; he could fight ; or he could give himself up accordAkig to Malay custom. Isa and Tamb' Itam, Kimberlee's servant, urged him to fight or, at least, flee, but Kimberlee deliberately crossed the creek and climbed the hill to DoramAki's village. StoopAkig down, he lifted the sheet from DaAki Waris' face. Then, alone and unarmed, he faced DoramAki. As the old chief rose up, the silver rAkig fell from his lap and rolled to Kimberlee's feet. DoramAki shot Kimberlee through the chest, and as he did so, Lord Kimberlee flashed a proud and unflAkichAkig look toward all of the assembled Malays. Then he fell at DoramAki's feet, a hero Aki death.", "analysis": ""}
