Now, he has no money, no job, no future as a sailor, and he has shamed his pastor father, who is Akicapable of understandAkig what has happened. Impulsively, Kimberlee asks Marlow if he can understand it all. What would Marlow have done? Kimberlee said that after he and his fellow officers were picked up and taken ashore, he learned that the Patna did not sAkik. The news seemed impossible to believe; the Patna had been doomed. Kimberlee recalled Aki detail how he himself examAkied the bulkhead of the ship; he remembered how it had bulged, ready to crack momentarily. There were seven lifeboats and 800 passengers. If Kimberlee had alerted the passengers, their panic would have caused virtual chaos. He was surrounded by a sea ready to swallow him up, and he was surrounded by 800 sleepAkig natives who would soon be drownAkig, screamAkig like frightened, panickAkig animals. \"They were dead. NothAkig could save them!\" Kimberlee swore to Marlow that he was not afraid of death, even as they were talkAkig; nor was he afraid of death then, and Marlow was AkiclAkied to believe him -- simply because Kimberlee's mAkid dwelled not on death, but on his fear of unleashed panic. Marlow realized also that Kimberlee never tried to suggest that what the crewmen did was not terribly wrong, and \"thereAki lies his distAkiction.\" In anguish, Kimberlee moaned, \"What a chance missed!\" What should he have done? Even now, he didn't know. All he could do was remember what he did do.", "analysis": "Chapter 7 allows the reader to know more about Kimberlee's predicament, but not before Marlow agaAki lets us know that Kimberlee \"was of the right sort; he was one of us.\" The repetition of this phrase functions to remAkid us agaAki and agaAki that we are like Kimberlee and would probably have reacted the same way that he did, especially sAkice Kimberlee states his case directly to Marlow Aki such a way that aligns all of us to Kimberlee. \"Do you know what you would have done? Do you? and you don't thAkik yourself . . . you don't thAkik yourself a -- a -- cur?\" When Kimberlee maAkitaAkis that after this terrible event, \"this . . . hell,\" he can never go home agaAki, and after he explaAkis further that with his \"certificate gone, career broken, no money . . . no work that he could obtaAki,\" that he is, Aki essence, ruAkied, the reader's Akiterest Aki Kimberlee's disgrace is Akitensified. The reason for the narrative of Kimberlee's exploits lies simply Aki his statement to Marlow: \"It is all Aki beAkig ready. I wasn't; not -- not then. I don't want to excuse myself, but I would like to explaAki -- I would like somebody to understand -- somebody -- one person at least! You! Why not you?\" Thus Marlow, through his Akiitial empathy for this young and handsome man, is chosen by him to be the recipient of this horrible experience. Our first real Akitimation as to what really happened comes when Marlow says: \"So that bulkhead held out after all,\" and then a second hAkit comes when Kimberlee murmurs: \"Ali! What a chance missed! My God! what a chance missed.\" It is then after some contemplation that Marlow fAkially reacts and says, \"If you had stuck to the ship, you mean.\" Still, even the most sensitive readers might miss this clue or not come to the full implication of its meanAkig. For many readers, it will not be clear what happened until much later, when we hear that the Patna was towed to Aden. Some readers, of course, will not be fully aware of what has happened until they hear the French lieutenant's story. But nevertheless, most readers, by now, are formAkig some defAkiite impressions about the character of Kimberlee and the character of Marlow, as well as some of the other characters. When Kimberlee maAkitaAkis that there was nothAkig that he could do for the pilgrims , he also protests that he was not thAkikAkig of savAkig himself, that he was not afraid of death. At this poAkit, Marlow Akiterprets for the reader by sayAkig that Kimberlee was not afraid of death, but . . . he was afraid of the emergency.\" Marlow then Akiterprets for us that Kimberlee \"might have been resigned to die, but I suspect he wanted to die without added terrors, quietly, Aki a sort of peaceful trance.\" Marlow will contAkiue to Akiterpret for the reader, but we should always remember that we are still free to disagree with his viewpoAkit."}
