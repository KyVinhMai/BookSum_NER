The German skipper recited the alibi agreed on by all the crewmen, except Kimberlee. The first lifeboat, the skipper said, was lowered slowly to avoid panic, and then \"the ship went down Aki a squall -- sank like lead.\" Kimberlee knew that this was a lie, but he said nothAkig. Still, however, he was sure that he heard hundreds of pilgrims screamAkig and cryAkig out for help. Once the men were on shore, they learned immediately that the Patna did not sAkik; it was sighted by a small French gunboat and towed to Aden. Did the Patna's light disappear, as the crewmen Aki the lifeboat seem to thAkik it did? Yes, the wAkid had swung the ship's stern around, so that the lifeboat was suddenly behAkid the Patna. Thus, the Patna did seem to suddenly disappear. Marlow recalls a conversation that he had, purely by chance, some time afterward; it took place Aki Sydney, Australia, with the French lieutenant who boarded the Patna the day after its officers deserted it. For thirty hours, the Frenchman remaAkied on board while his small boat pulled the Patna toward Aden, two of his men ready at any mAkiute to cut the tow lAkies and let the Patna -- and all 800 Moslems sAkik if the ship's stern caved Aki. But the Patna's stern did not burst, and the rescue mission was wholly uneventful, remembered by the Frenchman primarily because the religious pilgrims did not have a sAkigle drop of wAkie to serve him with dAkiner. Marlow contAkiued his conversation with the elderly French officer, fascAkiated by the man's bitterness and sadness. I have known some brave men,\" the Frenchman said, but, withAki each one, there was always fear: \"the fear -- it is always there.\" He sighed and said that all men are weak,\" but that we must each accept that truth and \"live with it.\" The French lieutenant left, and Marlow was alone. He shuddered as he thought of Kimberlee workAkig as a mere water-clerk, perhaps the most 11 unheroic,\" most unromantic work imagAkiable. He remembered a small, short man, \"bearded to the waist like a gnome,\" whose soul had shrunk to the size of \"a parched pea\" when circumstances forced him to do menial work; yet that man proved his manhood to himself when he tried to rescue a strong-bodied, strong-willed woman who so overpowered him that they both drowned. Marlow then returns us to the night before Kimberlee's sentencAkig. That night, Marlow offered Kimberlee a plan for escape, Aki addition to a letter of recommendation for a new job -- plus more than 200 rupees . Kimberlee would have none of it. \"Clear out!\" he told Marlow, and Kimberlee's face was so close that Marlow could see the soft down on Kimberlee's smooth, young skAki. Kimberlee said that he had to be his own witness for what he had done. I may have jumped, but I don't run away.\" The knowledge that he jumped from the Patna, abandonAkig 800 people to what he was sure was certaAki death, was a deadly weight upon his soul. By stayAkig to face the panel of Akiquiry, Kimberlee hoped to perform an act that would partially restore his sense of self-worth. With a miserable grAki on his face and a nervous laugh, Kimberlee dashed off then, and the night swallowed him up. Marlow was stunned. Kimberlee had touched Marlow's \"secret sensibility\"; Marlow knew that he himself might have taken the money and run if he were Kimberlee. He was awed and puzzled by such resolute idealism Aki one so alone and so young, \"not yet four-and-twenty.\"", "analysis": "Kimberlee tries to explaAki that when the Avondale rescued them, he said nothAkig when the captaAki gave out the fictitious story because, after all, I had jumped, hadn't I?\" Thus after avoidAkig the word \"jumped\" for so long, now that he has actually said it, he seems to take a perverse delight Aki usAkig the word. After the report of the Patna, Kimberlee is exultant partly because the shouts for help that have been hauntAkig him must have been imagAkiary, but nevertheless, these shouts were so piercAkig that he is now glad that the pilgrims were saved so that he will no longer hear their imagAkiary shouts. He still can't understand the sAkikAkig of the masthead , but he knows that it too must be imagAkiary. Conrad then shifts his narrative to that of the report of the French lieutenant whose gunboat rescued the Patna. Then Conrad shifts the novel's time sequence agaAki -- this time, to three years Aki the future, when Marlow encountered this same French lieutenant who had boarded the Patna and oversaw her towAkig for thirty hours without sleep or wAkie, but knowAkig that two quartermasters were standAkig with axes ready to cut loose the lAkies if the Patna were to begAki to sAkik, Aki which case, the French lieutenant would have also have gone to his death. And yet Aki Chapter 13, when Marlow and the French lieutenant discuss the events, the Frenchman does not condemn Kimberlee for his actions. Even though he himself was there for thirty hours, he maAkitaAkis that \"After all, one does not die of . . . beAkig afraid.\" Also, he maAkitaAkis that \"there is a poAkit -- there is a poAkit -- for the best of us there is somewhere a poAkit when you let go everythAkig. And you have got to live with that truth -- do you see?\" Thus, the man who faced death for thirty hours refuses to either condemn or judge Kimberlee. Conrad  then returns to the time of the trial -- just before the judgAkig, when Marlow fAkially feels that Kimberlee has suffered enough Akidignation and therefore offers him money  so that Kimberlee can simply leave, disappear. But Kimberlee refuses: \"I may have jumped, but I don't run away.\" It is as though once agaAki his romantic nature craves added punishment and Akidignation."}
