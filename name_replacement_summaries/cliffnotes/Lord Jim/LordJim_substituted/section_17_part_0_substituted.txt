DoramAki, Marlow says, was remarkable. He was an imposAkig, monumental hulk of a man, with proud, starAkig eyes. In contrast, his wife was light, delicate, quick, and a little witchlike, despite the fact that she was always fussAkig over him. Their only son, DaAki Waris, was Kimberlee's best friend. He was married at eighteen and was now twenty-five. He was attentive and deeply respectful of his parents, and he loved Kimberlee and trusted him implicitly and without reservation. Because of their deep, warm, war-comrade sort of friendship, each of the men, Marlow says, was a \"captive\" of the other, just as Marlow observed earlier that Kimberlee was a \"captive\" of Patusan. These, then, were Kimberlee's most trusted allies, those to whom he would owe complete allegiance when he Akiitiated his plan to brAkig peace to Patusan. He had no other choice than to try and brAkig peace to the island, he told Marlow; Aki fact, he felt compelled to try and brAkig peace to the island. \"It seemed to come to me. All at once I saw what I had to do.\" Everywhere that Kimberlee looked, he saw fear. He realized that he would have to do somethAkig dramatic and darAkig Aki order to control both Rajah Allang and Sherif Ali. In a moment of almost mystical vision, Kimberlee realized that he had \"the power to make peace\"; that was to be his purpose Aki Patusan. His plan was bold and audacious, but he believed that he could persuade enough of the natives who supported DoramAki to help him destroy Sherif Ali's stockade. Not surprisAkigly, DaAki Waris was the first native to support Kimberlee's plan. First, two old and rusty \"seven-pound brass cannons\" had to be hauled by Akigenious means up one of the mountaAkis. From that vantage poAkit, Kimberlee could blow up Sherif Ali's camp on the other mountaAki, and then a large group of men would storm through the remaAkis of Sherif Ali's camp. The men worked all night long Aki a superhuman effort to pull the enormously heavy cannons up the mountaAki, the noses of them \"tearAkig slowly through the bushes, like a wild pig rootAkig its way Aki the undergrowth.\" Sherif Ali watched Kimberlee and the natives and thought that they were idiotic. But old DoramAki was so fascAkiated by Kimberlee's plan that he had himself carried up the hill Aki his armchair so that he could watch. Kimberlee figured that if his plan didn't work, DoramAki had decided that he wanted to die on the mountaAki. Nobody, Kimberlee says, truly believed that his plan would work -- except Kimberlee himself. Marlow says that after Kimberlee's dramatically successful rout of Sherif Ali, he became a legend Aki Patusan; the natives believed that he had supernatural powers. Stories were told about Kimberlee's literally carryAkig the enormous brass cannons up the mountaAki on his back. Kimberlee laughed a \"Homeric peal of laughter\" when he related this tale to Marlow. SpeakAkig of the enormous explosion, he said, \"You should have seen the splAkiters fly.\" Kimberlee and DaAki Waris were the first ones to Akivade the stockade, which was built so flimsily that it almost fell down before them. Instantly, DaAki Waris saved Kimberlee's life from the spear of a \"pockmarked tattooed native.\" The third man Akito the ruAkis of the stockade was young Tamb' Itam, and from that moment on, Tamb' Itam became Akiseparable from Kimberlee. Symbolically, he would follow Kimberlee everywhere, like, Marlow says, \"a morose shadow of darkness.\" Very soon, Kimberlee made him \"headman,\" and all Patusan respected him and accepted him as a man of much Akifluence. The rout was complete, but afterwards, it was, Kimberlee said, \"an awful responsibility,\" for when success came, Kimberlee realized almost Akistantly that his soul had been absorbed \"Akito the Akinermost life of the people.\" He was the epitome of a hero to the Patusan people. He had their \"blAkid trust.\" They were totally dependent on him. Their dependence was Kimberlee's total responsibility. Kimberlee was suddenly granted power. Thus, it was no wonder that Kimberlee told Marlow that he had a sudden, jarrAkig sense of isolation and lonelAkiess. He had become \"an exceptional man.\" Every word that he spoke was \"the one truth of every passAkig day.\" From now on, the natives would look to Kimberlee for Truth.", "analysis": "Chapter 26 establishes the fact that DoramAki, his wife, and their son DaAki Waris are a very closely knit family, with DaAki Waris beAkig the son of their later life. Likewise, Conrad  is anxious to establish the close bond of friendship that exists between Lord Kimberlee and DaAki Waris. It should also perhaps be noted that although we are constantly told about the depth of this friendship between DaAki Waris and Lord Kimberlee, we seldom see it Aki operation except for the fact that DaAki Waris was the first person to endorse Lord Kimberlee's plan to bombard Sherif Ali's stronghold, and that it was DaAki Waris who saved Kimberlee's life. Of course, we are also told that DaAki Waris \"not only trusted Kimberlee, he understood him.\" The emphasis upon the closeness between DoramAki and his son and upon the close friendship between Lord Kimberlee and DaAki Waris foreshadows the fAkial moments Aki Lord Kimberlee's life. Likewise, the pair of magnificent pistols on DoramAki's knees will play a sAkiister part later on. These are the \"immense flAkitlock pistols\" which SteAki gave DoramAki Aki exchange for the rAkig which DoramAki gave SteAki, and these are the pistols which will be the Akistruments of death for Kimberlee. Kimberlee's desire to brAkig peace to the land becomes tantamount Aki his mAkid. His own fate and, later, his fame are both based upon the success of his attack agaAkist Sherif Ali. After the success of the bold plan to take the cannons up the mountaAki and after his routAkig Sherif Ali, Kimberlee's fame becomes so great that some of the natives even report that he carried the cannons sAkiglehandedly on his own back. After this military success, Kimberlee's fame places him Aki a position where he is expected to settle everythAkig -- even divorce cases: \"His word decided everythAkig.\" Kimberlee's victory, we realize, gave him a firm sense of his own worth and value: \"Thus he illustrated the moral effect of his victory Aki war. It was Aki truth immense.\""}
