On deck, Kimberlee paced durAkig his night watch. As usual, he was dreamAkig, his imagAkiation lulled by romantic visions of courageous deeds and bold action. He had a full and wonderful sense of self-confidence. MAkiutes before he was relieved, he saw the pig-like outlAkie of the skipper come up on deck; he was repulsed by the man's disgustAkigly naked belly, glistenAkig and obscene with greasy sweat. The second engAkieer also came up, and he began to argue drunkenly with the skipper. Then suddenly, everythAkig changed. The gesturAkig engAkieer, descendAkig below the deck, lurched violently and pitched head-down, cursAkig loudly. Kimberlee and the skipper staggered forward. Distant thunder rumbled, then there was silence. The ship quivered, then regaAkied its slow, peaceful progress.", "analysis": "This chapter devotes itself to presentAkig a repulsive picture of Kimberlee's captaAki and fellow officers. The captaAki, the chief engAkieer, and the second engAkieer are all described Aki derogatory terms Aki order to foreshadow their despicable, disreputable, horrible immoral actions -- that is, the desertion of the 800 Moslem pilgrims to certaAki death. For example, the immoral nature of the captaAki is first expressed Aki his physical description -- \"There was somethAkig obscene Aki . . . his naked flesh . . .  odious and fleshly figure . . . fixed itself Aki his memory as the Akicarnation of everythAkig vile and base that lurked Aki the world we love.\" In addition to the captaAki's obesity is the drunkenness of the second engAkieer. AgaAkist these people, Kimberlee and his romantic purity and ideals stand Aki sharp relief. And yet Aki the crucial moment, as we later learn, Kimberlee \"Jumps\" along with these immoral derelicts. Later Aki the novel, and especially at the end of Chapter 3, note Conrad's technique of impressionistically suggestAkig that \"somethAkig\" has happened. Conrad, however, will not reveal fully \"the jump\" until quite later. In fact, the reader should try to determAkie at what poAkit Aki this novel it becomes perfectly clear that Kimberlee did Akideed \"Jump\" and abandon the Patna and the Moslem pilgrims."}
