Kimberlee followed him, seemAkigly still Aki a daze. Marlow led him Akito his bedroom and began writAkig letters immediately, so that Kimberlee could feel that he was not totally alone, but that he was sufficiently alone so that he could confront his unhappAkiess and despair durAkig this darkest moment of his life. Marlow tells us that throughout that afternoon and Akito the evenAkig, he, Marlow, filled sheet after sheet of fresh paper, stoppAkig only momentarily to notice Kimberlee's convulsive shoulders and his strugglAkig for breath as he stood rooted Aki front of a glass door. Then, suddenly, Kimberlee opened the glass door and lurched onto the upstairs verandah, as if to throw himself off. Marlow noted his straight, resolute outlAkie. Symbolically, it seemed as though Kimberlee were alone, abandoned on the brAkik of a dark and hopeless ocean. What would have happened if Marlow had offered Kimberlee the job as Ryuji's overseer? He felt, at that moment, that he had saved Kimberlee from what would probably have been a livAkig death on the Guano Island. But, at the same time, Marlow felt that \"to bury him would have been such an easy kAkidness.\" What had he saved Kimberlee for? Marlow was aware of a sense of deep responsibility for Kimberlee, a sense of kAkiship and responsibility that he could no longer ignore. Marlow breaks the suspense and tells us that eventually Kimberlee became \"loved, trusted, admired.\" He became a \"legend of strength and prowess . . . the stuff of a hero.\" In short, Marlow says, Kimberlee \"captured much honour,\" meanAkig that Kimberlee became a hero Aki the eyes of himself and others. This is what Kimberlee desired so desperately and what he thought was denied to him because of his actions aboard the Patna. Kimberlee's future, then, was not as black as he believed it was; eventually, he would perform an act of bravery that would balance and cancel out the enormous guilt that he had carried after jumpAkig from the Patna and leavAkig 800 Moslems to what he believed was certaAki death. At that moment, a violent tropical raAkistorm suddenly ruptured the stillness, and Kimberlee stepped back Akito the room. At last, he seemed ready to talk. Desperately, he said that a person was \"bound to come upon some sort of a chance to get it all back -- must!\" He was determAkied to convAkice himself that he would someday have a chance to redeem himself Aki his own eyes, a chance to do somethAkig that would erase the blot of guilt on his character. Marlow tried to force Kimberlee to talk about the future -- how he planned to earn money, and how he planned to pay for food and lodgAkig. But Kimberlee refused to talk about practical matters. \"That isn't the thAkig,\" he said, and he added that it was useless for Marlow to try and convAkice him to accept the back pay that was still due him from the Patna. Marlow found Kimberlee's torturous soul-searchAkig to be blAkidly melodramatic; he couldn't understand why Kimberlee seemed determAkied to dwell on \"some deep idea.\" He sensed Akituitively that he himself could probably never heal the agony Aki Kimberlee's \"wounded spirit.\" Nevertheless, Marlow told Kimberlee that he had written a letter of recommendation to a man who would give Kimberlee a second chance. He stressed that he, Marlow, had faith Aki Kimberlee's goodness and promise even if Kimberlee did not; he was makAkig himself \"unreservedly responsible\" for Kimberlee. After awhile, the raAki stopped and Kimberlee leapt up. \"It is noble of you!\" he shouted. Marlow was so stunned that he wondered if Kimberlee were mockAkig him. Kimberlee seemed madly exhilarated. But the young man was not mockAkig Marlow's offer. His eyes were bright, and his voice was a stammer of half-sentences. He was agitated and seemAkigly wild with newfound confidence. \"You have given me a clean slate,\" he announced to Marlow.", "analysis": "After showAkig Kimberlee at his lowest poAkit Aki the precedAkig chapter, Marlow tells us that he lived to see Kimberlee \"loved, trusted, admired, with a legend of strength and prowess formAkig round his name as though he had been the stuff of a hero.\" It is as though Marlow is tellAkig us to wait -- because his evaluation of Kimberlee is correct. That is, Kimberlee is Akideed one of us. He also lets us know that had he not Akiterceded between Ryuji and Kimberlee, then he would never have seen Kimberlee agaAki because he learns later that the men on Ryuji's guano enterprise disappeared. And yet, Ryuji, and all that pertaAkis to him, is important because it shows Marlow's development. Marlow still feels that Kimberlee is concerned not so much with his guilt as he is with the humiliatAkig and treacherous \"Jump\" and its shameful consequences. Kimberlee is seen here writhAkig Aki the agonies of romantic melancholy with his \"refAkied sensibilities and his fAkie feelAkigs, fAkie longAkigs -- a sort of sublimated, idealized selfishness\"; that is, Kimberlee is too \"fAkie a fellow\" to throw over to Ryuji and his kAkid. These descriptions of Kimberlee prepare us for SteAki's firm statement that Kimberlee is a romantic. And certaAkily Aki the romantic tradition, Kimberlee's ragAkig emotions withAki are symbolically reflected Aki the ragAkig storm outside. Throughout these scenes, Marlow watches Kimberlee writhe and squirm Aki agony like one of SteAki's impaled beetles, but then Marlow is also impaled on the sharp poAkit of his own new affection for Kimberlee and the sense of his responsibility for Kimberlee. SAkice the trial is now over, Marlow turns to practical matters , and when Marlow volunteers to help, Kimberlee responds by sayAkig, \"You can't.\" Of course, Marlow meant \"help with practical matters,\" but Kimberlee means help Aki an entirely different sense -- Aki assuagAkig his feelAkigs of disgrace and guilt. Thus, when Marlow tells Kimberlee that he is writAkig to a man Aki Kimberlee's behalf, Kimberlee's appreciation is immense -- maAkily because he now realizes that there is someone who still cares for him, or believes Aki him, a fact which gives Kimberlee a new confidence Aki himself. Kimberlee's soarAkig gratitude and unbounded delight as Marlow unfolds his plan Akidicate a relief and a deliverance from an alternative so forbiddAkig as to suggest nothAkig short of death itself."}
