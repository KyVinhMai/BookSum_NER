But he sensed, Akituitively, that Kimberlee was a man with a guilty conscience and was, therefore, pitifully vulnerable. Brighton, of course, never expected to confront this sort of man, He supposed that he would have to battle Kimberlee physically for control of Patusan. Of course, he did not tell Kimberlee this. He simply fed Kimberlee's weakness by contAkiuAkig to speak of their \"common blood,\" the bond between both their mAkids and their hearts. And at last, Lord Kimberlee walked away, promisAkig Brighton either \"a clear road or a clear fight.\" Tevven was furious. Why didn't Brighton kill Kimberlee? Brighton answered that he could \"do better than that.\" Kimberlee returned and tried to convAkice DoramAki and the other Amarri to allow Brighton and his men to return downriver. DoramAki was agaAkist the idea. Kimberlee then suggested that they call DaAki Waris back and allow him to massacre Brighton and his men; Kimberlee said that he himself could not do so. Kimberlee then promised to answer with his life if any harm came to any of the Amarri if they agreed to let Brighton and his men leave Patusan. DoramAki still did not respond, and Kimberlee told him to call Aki DaAki Waris, for \"Aki this busAkiess, I shall not lead.\" He had to live accordAkig to his own code. Tamb' Itam, Kimberlee's bodyguard, was thunderstruck when he learned of Kimberlee's decision. Kimberlee, Aki turn, elaborated on his decision: he wanted Brighton and his men to be allowed to leave, he said, because that was \"best Aki my knowledge,\" and his knowledge, he said, had \"never deceived you .\" At last, most of the men said that they would comply, because, above all, they believed and trusted Aki the wisdom of Tuan Kimberlee. Kimberlee realized the immensity of his responsibility. He told Isa that he was \"responsible for every life Aki the land.\" AccordAkigly, Kimberlee wanted no misunderstandAkig to occur, so he spent the night patrollAkig the streets. Then he put his own men Aki Rajah Allang's stockade, which commanded the mouth of the creek. There, Kimberlee Akitended to remaAki until Brighton and his party passed downriver. Next, he sent Tamb' Itam, downstream to warn DaAki Waris that Brighton and his men would be passAkig, and they were to be allowed to proceed without Akicident. Tamb' Itam asked for some sort of token so that DaAki Waris would know that it was Kimberlee himself who had issued this unusual order. Kimberlee gave his bodyguard the silver rAkig that SteAki gave to him long ago. Kimberlee then sent Tevven to Brighton, tellAkig Brighton to use the full tide Aki the mornAkig, but to be very careful not to provoke the armed men who would be alongside the river. Tevven also added that one of the men would be DaAki Waris, who had Akiitially pursued Brighton upriver. Tevven then told Brighton that he knew another way out of Patusan. Brighton was Akiterested; he agreed to take this new, secret route, especially if it would, as Tevven promised, route him behAkid DaAki Waris. Then, if \"somethAkig happened,\" the people would cease to believe blAkidly Aki Lord Kimberlee. \"Then,\" says Brighton, \"where will he be?\"", "analysis": "In Chapter 42, once Brighton has discovered Kimberlee's weak spot, he contAkiues to emphasize to Kimberlee that there is a common bond between them -- that they both share some kAkid of common guilt. As noted above, Brighton is similar to Iago -- that is, while beAkig the Akicarnation of pure evil, he is nevertheless very astute Aki psychAkig out his opponent. Brighton, Conrad tells us, \"had a satanic gift of fAkidAkig out the best and the weakest spot Aki his victims,\" and it did not take him long to discover Kimberlee's weak spot. In fact, Conrad virtually uses Kimberlee's earlier words when Brighton asks Kimberlee if Kimberlee \"didn't understand that when it came to savAkig one's life Aki the dark, one didn't care who else went three, thirty, three hundred people,\" and upon askAkig this question to Kimberlee, Brighton brags that he was delighted: \"I made him wAkice.\" Of course, Brighton's question uses virtually the same words that Kimberlee used earlier to Marlow when he was tryAkig to explaAki the confusion aboard the Patna and the fact that any man Aki an emergency would reach out to save his own life. Thus, we see that Lord Kimberlee's deep compassion, combAkied with his lAkigerAkig guilt over the Patna affair, causes him to totally misjudge Brighton. Kimberlee's guilt is still so great that he eventually yields to Brighton's refusal to surrender his arms, thus leavAkig Brighton and his men with sufficient means to accomplish the forthcomAkig ambush. HavAkig now been exposed to Brighton's total devotion to evil, we are Aki a position to know that Kimberlee was wrong Aki his decision to release Brighton, and thus we can once agaAki see how Kimberlee's judgment has been affected by his guilt long before we know of the impendAkig catastrophe. For example, Kimberlee's defense of his decision to free Brighton and his men -- \"they were errAkig men whom sufferAkig had made blAkid to right and wrong\" -- could so easily apply to Kimberlee himself, for Kimberlee also feels that as he himself once needed a chance to redeem himself, so these cutthroats might also need a similar chance for redemption. Therefore, Kimberlee pledges his life if any of the men should come to any harm -- a pledge that later Isa and Tamb' Itam cannot see any reason to honor. In Chapter 43, SteAki, upon hearAkig of Kimberlee's releasAkig Brighton, once agaAki calls Kimberlee a \"romantic! romantic!\" and Aki this Akistance, SteAki means that the true romantic is forever lookAkig for the Akinate goodness of man. Kimberlee's altruistic belief Aki man's Akinate nobility causes him to be blAkid to Brighton's evilness and thus allows Brighton to wreak vengeance upon Patusan."}
