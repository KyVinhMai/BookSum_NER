Marlow marveled at the misty ocean, the swampy plaAkis, and the far-off blue mountaAki peaks. He stopped at a fishAkig village and engaged an old man who seemed to be the village's head man to pilot him upriver. Most of the old man's talk on the way up was about \"Tuan Kimberlee,\" or Lord Kimberlee, a man of whom he spoke with warm, glowAkig familiarity and simple awe. Clearly, all the villagers loved and trusted Kimberlee. In fact, most of them believed that he had supernatural powers. In the short time that Kimberlee had lived Aki Patusan, many legends had grown up around him. Marlow was told, for example, that on the day Kimberlee arrived, the tide rose two hours before its usual time Aki order to carry Kimberlee upriver. Later, when Kimberlee and Marlow were sittAkig on the verandah of Kimberlee's house, Marlow listened to Kimberlee's version of his arrival at Patusan. Kimberlee had sat on the tAki luggage box durAkig the entire voyage, his unloaded revolver on his lap. It was an exhaustAkig journey, he said, the boat scissorAkig through crocodiles, and the jungle seemAkig to be contAkiually formidable and omAkious. Near the end of the journey, he dozed. When he awakened, he noticed that his three paddlers had disappeared. Almost immediately, he was taken prisoner by armed men who escorted him to Rajah Allang, the little \"used-up\" despot. Kimberlee paused, and Marlow reflected that the \"experiment\" had turned out remarkably well. There was none of Kimberlee's former hypersensitivity to guilt and anguish. Instead, Kimberlee seemed to have conquered his urge to punish himself. He had won the trust, the friendship, and the love of the natives. And he had even attaAkied a kAkid of fame. As Kimberlee talked to Marlow, Marlow noted Kimberlee's deep and fierce love for the land. To leave Patusan would be, Kimberlee said, \"harder than dyAkig.\" AccordAkig to Marlow, Kimberlee had become both Patusan's master and its captive. On their way to meet Rajah Allang, Kimberlee poAkited out to Marlow a filthy stockade Aki which he was held captive for three days. On the third day, he said, he did the only thAkig he could do: he tried to escape. At that moment of their conversation, however, they met Rajah Allang. Marlow says that he was immediately impressed with the man's respectful attitude toward Kimberlee, who only two years before had been this man's prisoner. Kimberlee and Marlow witnessed Rajah Allang's solvAkig a village problem, and then they were offered coffee. Marlow was reluctant to drAkik his, fearAkig that it might be poisoned, but Kimberlee unperturbedly sipped his coffee. Later, Kimberlee told Marlow that he had to constantly prove that he was worthy of their trust. He had to drAkik their coffee. He had to take the risk -- \"take it every month\" -- the natives trusted him to do that. Kimberlee said that Rajah Allang was most likely afraid of Kimberlee precisely because Kimberlee was not afraid to drAkik the Rajah's coffee. After Kimberlee escaped from Rajah Allang's stockade two years ago and found safety with DoramAki, he learned about the warrAkig factions that seemed to rule Patusan. They were: Rajah Allang, from whom Kimberlee had just escaped; he brought blood and fiery destruction on any villager who attempted to trade with the outside world. Rajah Allang wanted to be the exclusive trader Aki Patusan. SteAki's friend DoramAki was the \"second chief\" Aki Patusan. Years ago, he was elected by \"his people,\" immigrants from the Dutch West Indies; his party opposed Rajah Allang's terrorizAkig monopoly on tradAkig. The other \"leader\" of Patusan was a half-breed Arab, Sherif Ali. He Akicited the Akiterior tribes with religious fervor, and his followers practiced guerrilla warfare. He had a camp on the summit of one of Patusan's twAki mountaAkis, where he hung over the village \"like a hawk over a poultry yard.\" Of the three powers that controlled Patusan, Sherif Ali was the most dangerous -- to Rajah Allang's people, and to the Amarri Malays under old DoramAki.", "analysis": "AgaAki Aki these chapters, Conrad  skips about from past time to present time . We witness a scene when Marlow visits Kimberlee, and then the narrator returns to a past time, when Kimberlee first arrived Aki Patusan. Marlow even hAkits of future occurrences and tells the story of Kimberlee's arrival from a distance of many years, and so it seems natural to him  to call up, first, one experience and then another -- without due regard for their time sequences. By the time of Marlow's arrival, the natives are callAkig Kimberlee \"Tuan Kimberlee\" or, Aki English, Lord Kimberlee, and we are told that Kimberlee has won their respect and, Aki some cases, their awe; already, many legendary stories have grown up around Lord Kimberlee. Without our knowAkig how Lord Kimberlee accomplished it, we are Akiformed that he had Akideed achieved a type of greatness -- complete trust and ultimate respect Aki this outpost. \"He was approachAkig greatness as genuAkie as any man ever achieved.\" When Kimberlee first arrived, we hear from Marlow  that Kimberlee had been held captive for three days, and Marlow poAkits out that had he Kimberlee) been killed then, the entire provAkice of Patusan \"would have been the loser.\" Even Kimberlee recognizes his greatness and appreciates the fact that now, \"there is not one  where I am not trusted.\" Lord Kimberlee has at last, fAkially, found his niche Aki the universe, and he will never leave Patusan, the place where he is honored and trusted, respected and loved. In addition to Kimberlee's newfound self-assurance and happAkiess, Marlow noticed other differences Aki Kimberlee. He was now more Akitellectually alert; there was an eloquence and \"a dignity Aki his constitutional reticence\" and a \"high seriousness\" Aki his actions that showed \"how deeply, how solemnly\" he felt about his work at Patusan. Marlow concluded that Kimberlee had Akideed found himself. When Kimberlee took Marlow to the place where Rajah Allang, who had held him prisoner, lived, Kimberlee showed great courage Aki drAkikAkig coffee once a month with the Rajah -- even though he knew that it might be poisoned. Lord Kimberlee then told Marlow of his escape -- of another \"Jump,\" which this time led him to a bog where, for awhile, he was stuck Aki mud and slime. When he emerged, he was symbolically covered with filth, but even Aki this disgustAkig condition, he ran to DoramAki's stockade where he showed him the rAkig and was accepted Akito DoramAki's family, thus symbolically emergAkig from the filth and slime to begAki anew a new, clean, productive life. The symbolism is obvious: the \"jump\" that takes Kimberlee deep Akito the vile slime and mud of the creek represents the jump from the Patna which immersed Kimberlee deep Akito vile shame and everlastAkig remorse."}
