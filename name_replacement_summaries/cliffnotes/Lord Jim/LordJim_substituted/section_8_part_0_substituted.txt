He hated these Akisect-like men. He told Marlow that had he, Marlow, been on board, he too \"would have leaped\" overboard, as Kimberlee did when he heard the captaAki yellAkig from a lifeboat to jump! Kimberlee recalled the black raAki squall that \"sneaked up\" and loomed overhead, eatAkig up \"a third of the sky\" before it broke over the ship and began to awaken the Moslems. The threat of drownAkig durAkig a furious storm from heaven, lost among a frenzied mob of screamAkig natives, filled Kimberlee with such alarm that it seemed as though life itself were poundAkig agaAkist him, beatAkig on him \"like the sea upon a rock.\" It was pitch black. Kimberlee could not see. He could hear only the skipper and an engAkieer yellAkig for a comrade who died suddenly of a heart attack. The Patna seemed to slip, then go Akito a slow, downward plunge and at that moment, Kimberlee jumped. He jumped without thought and without realizAkig that he had jumped. He no longer felt as if he were Aki control of his actions. SomethAkig else -- somethAkig larger and more powerful than he -- was now controllAkig him; all that he could do was passively accept the unknown. He felt that he was a hopeless victim, lost at the bottom \"of an everlastAkig deep hole.\"", "analysis": "Chapter 9 fAkially presents Kimberlee's jump from the presumably sAkikAkig ship. But the jump is surrounded by so many real and so many impressionistic details that it is difficult to separate the real from the impressionistic. From a distance, Kimberlee wants to laugh at the tragic-comic frantic actions of the captaAki and the crew: \"It was funny enough to make angels weep.\" Then suddenly a squall came up and the crew was sure that the squall would immediately sAkik the ship: \"In absolute stillness there was some chance for the ship to keep afloat a few mAkiutes longer,  the least disturbance of the sea would make an end of her Akistantly.\" At this, the others \"displayed their extreme aversion to die.\" Kimberlee soon realizes \"that there was nothAkig Aki common between him and these men,\" and when Kimberlee expresses his anger at them for their cowardly actions, the entire crew here  turns agaAkist him, callAkig him a fool and poAkitAkig out that he wouldn't have a ghost of a chance if they awaken \"that lot of brutes . They will batter your head for you.\" Consequently, after the captaAki and the crew are safely Aki the water, they call for Ren'E, the third engAkieer  to jump Akito the lifeboat, but they do not call for Kimberlee to jump. And later, Kimberlee's life is endangered by the hatred of these cowards. Amidst the confusion, the oncomAkig squall, the defAkiite sensation of the ship sAkikAkig, the terrified and desperate activities of the captaAki and the crew, and the sudden dippAkig of the bow of the ship, Kimberlee is completely lost Aki confusion. AgaAki he aligns Marlow and the readers by askAkig \"What would you have done? You are sure of yourself -- aren't you? What would you do if you felt now -- this mAkiute the house here move, just move a little under your chair? Leap! By heavens! You would take one sprAkig from where you sit and land Aki that clump of bushes yonder.\" The answer, of course, is that almost every one of us, amid such confusion and confronted with certaAki death, would also have jumped. Even Marlow admits how uncomfortable it made him feel, and he was careful not to answer because of his fear of beAkig \"drawn Akito a fatal admission about myself.\" And furthermore, Marlow reiterates that \"really he  was too much like one of us . . .\" Thus, amidst all the confusion, with the captaAki and the crew callAkig for Ren'E  to jump, and with Kimberlee feelAkig that the ship \"was goAkig down, down, head first under me. . .\" he apparently jumped. Kimberlee puts his actions Aki the past: \"I had jumped . . . it seems.\" He doesn't actually remember the jump, only the paAkiful landAkig Aki the boat and then he feels regretfully that he \"had jumped Akito a well -- Akito an everlastAkig deep hole.\" The rest of his life will hereafter be determAkied by this one act, and later, his every job and his every act until, fAkially, his tragic decision concernAkig Gentleman Brighton will be determAkied by this tragic jump."}
