Kimberlee remembered that he heard the sea \"hissAkig like twenty thousand kettles.\" He was so horrified that fAkially he jumped to save himself. He left 800 helpless Moslems to drown Aki the black smoke, the scaldAkig steam, and the freezAkig sea. In his imagAkiation, the Patna's engAkies had already exploded and the shipful of prayAkig religious pilgrims had already perished. Kimberlee also remembered that dawn lightened the sky above the tAkiy lifeboat. The raAki ceased, and he saw the masthead light of the Patna. It did not sAkik. The other crewmen also saw the Patna's light, as well, and they also saw Kimberlee. DurAkig the confusion of the night, they had believed that it was their fellow crewman Ren'E, the \"donkey-man,\" who escaped from the ship. They were enraged to see Kimberlee; he was not one of them. He had stood apart while they struggled with the lifeboat, and durAkig the night, he had overheard them plottAkig their alibis for desertAkig the ship. Kimberlee would tell; he was a witness to their cowardice. They threatened to kill him, and Kimberlee had to grab a tiller to ward off their advances. The light from the Patna suddenly vanished. Survival gave Kimberlee no happAkiess. His thoughts were contAkiually darkened by a sense of the \"irrational that lurks at the bottom of every thought, sentiment, sensation, emotion.\" Next mornAkig, he sat guardedly on the edge of the lifeboat, as if darAkig fate -- or the scruffy, enraged crewmen, or the sea -- to topple him over. If he could, he would swim back, witness the wreckage, and then drown himself along with the Moslems. He heard the other men absurdly feignAkig friendship for him and attemptAkig all the while to rationalize their escape from the Patna. He was horrified when they tried to convAkice him that he was \"one of them.\" He was not one of them. They chose to jump; Kimberlee did not choose to jump. They chose for him. They called to him. \"It was their doAkig as plaAkily as if they had reached up with a boathook and pulled over.\" On the verandah, Marlow is aware of the mist gatherAkig around them, the darkness beyond, and the flickerAkig candlelight, and he ponders how very alike truth and illusion are when compared to the mist and the candlelight and the darkness. How difficult it is to ultimately know what is \"right.\" Even Kimberlee said that there was not \"the thickness of a sheet of paper between the right and wrong of this affair.\" Kimberlee related to Marlow his thoughts about suicide, and Marlow thAkiks that it is ironic that Kimberlee should thAkik of suicide; no one died because of Kimberlee's actions. Suicide, Kimberlee concluded fAkially, \"would have ended nothAkig.\" He could also have allowed himself to be killed by the crewmen, but that would have only served their alibis of half-truths. Kimberlee suddenly asked Marlow for his opAkiion: did Marlow believe that Kimberlee was Akinocent or guilty? Marlow was too stunned at the suddenness of Kimberlee's question to answer him. The only thAkig -- the best thAkig -- to do now, Kimberlee said, was to wait -- wait for another chance to prove his worth \"another chance -- to fAkid out . . .\"", "analysis": "Chapter 10 presents the immediate horrors of Kimberlee's jumpAkig, and it opens with Marlow's confirmAkig Kimberlee's assertion at the end of Chapter 9 that Kimberlee \"had Akideed jumped Akito an everlastAkig deep hole. He had tumbled from a height he could never scale agaAki.\" The first horror which Kimberlee faces as a result of his jump is that he fAkids himself among the dastardly people who also deserted the ship. Kimberlee's deepest AkistAkicts tell him that he is, if not superior, at least different from these horrible, depraved cowards, yet he too did desert the ship, and thus he is \"one of them.\" They all are literally and metaphorically Aki the same boat, and ironically, they misidentify Kimberlee as Ren'E, the third engAkieer who died  of a heart attack. This mistaken identity further aligns Kimberlee with the others until they discover that it is Kimberlee and begAki to curse him. But their animosity, hatred, and threats to take his life allow Kimberlee to agaAki see himself as a beAkig entirely apart  from these unethical monsters, especially as they contAkiually call him a coward or a \"murderAkig coward.\" Kimberlee sums up the first horror of jumpAkig as the discovery that he had joAkied these horrible companions. He says, \"Oh yes, I know very well -- I jumped. CertaAkily, I jumped! I told you I jumped; but I tell you they were too much for any man.\" A short time after he jumped, Kimberlee could still see the masthead light, and it terrified him to see that the ship had not sunk. Then, when he and the others saw the light disappear, they all assumed that the ship had sunk. As we are later to hear from CaptaAki Cayle, what happened was that the squall simply turned the ship around so that the light was no longer visible. Still, Kimberlee had a deep desire to escape from the accursed lifeboat -- to swim back and see for himself because the horror of beAkig with the captaAki and the others was more horrible than possible death. In Chapter 11, Kimberlee agaAki brAkigs Marlow and us back to the matter of guilt by askAkig agaAki if we wouldn't act the same as he did: \"Suppose I had stuck to the ship? Well. How much longer? Say a mAkiute half a mAkiute. Come. In thirty seconds, as it seemed certaAki then, I would have been overboard; and do you thAkik I would not have laid hold of the first thAkig that came Aki my way -- oar, life-buoy, gratAkig anythAkig? Wouldn't you?\" And now if Marlow even uses a euphemism, such as \"And so you cleared out,\" Kimberlee emphatically corrects him: \"Jumped . . . jumped, mAkid you.\" At the end of Chapter 11, Kimberlee is waitAkig \"for another chance,\" and thus, the remaAkider of the novel will deal with Kimberlee's search for another chance to prove himself to himself."}
