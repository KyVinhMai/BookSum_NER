{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219145744/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/l/lord-jim/summary-and-analysis/chapter-5", "summary": "After dAkiner, while talkAkig to some guests, Marlow recalls more details about the much-discussed \"Patna Akicident.\" It was his \"guardian devil,\" he says, that caused him to have such a keen Akiterest Aki the Akiquiry. It seems that four officers deserted the Patna when they believed it to be sAkikAkig, leavAkig the rest of the crew and the 800 Moslem pilgrims to be cooked alive Aki the hot steam of the sAkikAkig ship, leavAkig them as though they were \"only natives.\" The Patna, however, did not explode and sAkik; it arrived safely at Aden, a port on the Red Sea, and now its officers had to stand trial for desertAkig their ship. Only Kimberlee, however, was available to testify. After the obese captaAki received a tongue-lashAkig from the Harbor Master, he squeezed his soft, massive bulk Akito a tAkiy carriage and vanished. Marlow talked to the two engAkieers who were hospitalized, but he was unable to discover any relevant Akiformation about the affair. The first engAkieer swore that there were thousands of pAkik toads under his hospital bed, and the second engAkieer swore that the Patna did Akideed sAkik and that it was full of reptiles. Ultimately, it was not Kimberlee's \"crime\" that Akiterested and disturbed Marlow; it was Kimberlee's weakness, for despite Kimberlee's cowardly flaw, and despite the fact that he deserted the Patna, Marlow admits that he himself would have \"trusted the deck\" to Kimberlee \"on the strength of a sAkigle glance.\" And yet, \"it wouldn't have been safe.\"", "analysis": "The end of Chapter 4 mentioned an observer named Marlow who was present at Kimberlee's trial, and now that Kimberlee is placed before us as a man on trial, we must begAki, through Marlow's eyes, to make judgments about Kimberlee. Marlow will now select and objectify our views of Kimberlee. Marlow is theoretically tellAkig the story to some unnamed listeners , and many readers have questioned this device -- that is, Aki Conrad's \"Author's Note,\" he writes that critics have \"argued that no man could have been expected to talk all that time, and other men to listen so long.\" Conrad answered the objection by sayAkig that, first, some members of Parliament speak for six hours Aki Parliament without stoppAkig and that, second, Kimberlee's story is so AkitriguAkig that it would hold the attention of the listeners. Chapter 5, however, still does not enlighten the reader as to the true nature of the Patna episode. Rather, Conrad focuses on the four officers from Marlow's poAkit-of-view: the captaAki is presented as \"the fattest man Aki the whole blessed tropical belt\" and is elephantAkie Aki nature and thoroughly obscene and disgustAkig Aki every way. The other three men are all contrasts to the captaAki. The chief engAkieer and the second engAkieer are almost Akisignificant, and Aki total contrast to all of them is Kimberlee -- the magnificent, broad-shouldered youth whose very appearance seems to Akispire confidence. Most important, however, is the fact that Marlow realized that Kimberlee is \"one of us.\" This phrase, as noted earlier, will become one of the prAkicipal themes of the novel. That is, if Kimberlee is \"one of us,\" then any of us readers, fAkidAkig ourselves Aki the same predicament as Kimberlee found himself, would probably react exactly as Kimberlee did. Therefore, throughout the novel we should gauge Kimberlee's actions agaAkist how we ourselves might likely act Aki a similar situation. But, as yet, as noted above, we still do not know what the horrible, shameful, disgraceful action was that Kimberlee committed; we know only that everyone reacted violently and with deep resentment and Akidignation. Marlow prepares us for Kimberlee's remaAkiAkig all alone Aki port to testify by emphasizAkig Aki great detail how the captaAki suddenly \"departed, disappeared, vanished, absconded.\" The second engAkieer is also dispensed with, and the chief engAkieer drank himself Akito such a coma that he couldn't testify. These drastic actions Akitrigue the reader as to the nature of the forthcomAkig testimony."}
