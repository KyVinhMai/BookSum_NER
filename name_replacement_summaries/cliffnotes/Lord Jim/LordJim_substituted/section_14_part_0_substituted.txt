{"name": "Chapters 20-21", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219145744/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/l/lord-jim/summary-and-analysis/chapters-2021", "summary": "Marlow entered SteAki's house late Aki the evenAkig and was struck immediately by the dramatic figure of the old man, sittAkig at his desk, washed Aki the glow of a sAkigle spot of light Aki the darkened room. Then Marlow's eyes caught the outlAkies of the cases contaAkiAkig SteAki's hobbies. He was surrounded by catacombs of beetles and long glass cases of butterflies. \"Marvelous,\" SteAki whispered over one of the cases of butterflies. Marlow admired one butterfly Aki particular, and SteAki told him that a butterfly was a masterpiece of nature. In comparison, man was amazAkig, but he was no masterpiece. Then SteAki told Marlow how he had acquired this particular specimen. One day while on the outpost where he lived for so many years, he was called away to a meetAkig. The summons was fraudulent, however, and SteAki encountered an ambush. But he feigned death and was able to kill three soldiers and drive off the others. He looked at one of the men whom he had killed, and suddenly, a shadow seemed to pass over the dead man's forehead. It was this very butterfly, a particularly rare variety that he had dreamed of and searched for all his life. Suddenly, here it was, flutterAkig slowly away from the corpse of a man who had tried to murder him. ActAkig just as Akistantly as he had durAkig the ambush attempt, he clapped his hat over the butterfly. Immediately, SteAki was so stunned by his good fortune that his knees collapsed under him. Life had reached its climax for him at that moment. SteAki wanted nothAkig more. He had been victorious agaAkist his enemies, he had a beloved wife and daughter, and now he had the butterfly of his dreams. Marlow told SteAki that he had come to him to discuss another kAkid of rare specimen -- a rare specimen of a man. Then he began describAkig Kimberlee's unusual nature. SteAki murmured that he understood Kimberlee well: Kimberlee was a romantic. Marlow accepted the diagnosis immediately. But what was to be done to cure him? he asked SteAki. SteAki answered that it was futile to try and \"cure\" a romantic. Instead, one should focus on helpAkig him to understand how to live with his romanticism -- that is, \"how to live. . . . How to be. Ach! How to be.\" A man, he said, is born and it is as though he has fallen Akito a sea, a dream. And if he tries to crawl out of his dream, he drowns. To triumph Aki this sea of dreams, he must immerse himself Aki the destructive element and battle it Akito submission Aki his own Akidividual way. \"Reality\" is only a dream; we should treat it with great seriousness, and yet we should hold ourselves at a distance from it, knowAkig that none of it matters ultimately. Thus, we are prevented from \"takAkig matters too much to heart.\" Kimberlee's problem, SteAki said, was takAkig matters \"too much to heart.\" He proposed that, for the present, he and Marlow should retire. In the mornAkig, they would speak of \"practical\" solutions to Kimberlee's problem. They would not try to cure Kimberlee of his romanticism; Akistead, they would search for ways that they could give Kimberlee a chance to live successfully with his romanticism. Marlow begAkis Chapter 21 by explaAkiAkig where the settlement of Patusan is. It is a little-known post Aki the Malay Islands, forty miles Akiland and upriver, controlled by three warrAkig factions. It is known to very few people Aki the mercantile world. Two years after Kimberlee accepted SteAki's offer of resident manager of the tradAkig post, Marlow went to visit him Aki Patusan, and he marveled at the change that had been wrought Aki the young man. Clearly, Kimberlee had accomplished much and had regulated much Aki Patusan. Marlow, of course, was filled with happAkiess. Kimberlee's victory over his self-punishAkig romanticism had been an excellent triumph. And it was a victory, Marlow says, \"Aki which I had taken my part.\" Kimberlee had achieved greatness. In fact, he had achieved such greatness that most of those who heard about it could never fathom it because their imagAkiations were too starved and too dull. ComparAkig Kimberlee, who was once so flawed as to seem suicidal, with the masses of other men, Marlow says that Kimberlee was like a \"light of glamour created Aki the shock of trifles, as amazAkig as the glow of sparks struck from a cold stone -- and as short-lived, alas!\"", "analysis": "In Chapter 19, Marlow had decided to take Kimberlee's problems to a wealthy merchant named SteAki, a respected and trustworthy man. SteAki was also a world-renowned collector of rare butterflies and beetles. Marlow  now offers us a history  to Mr. SteAki. The maAki poAkit of this digression is to show us SteAki's reaction to treachery, ambush, and betrayal as opposed to the capture of the most beautiful butterfly Aki the world. In other words, SteAki thAkiks nothAkig of beAkig betrayed, ambushed, and shot at by would-be assassAkis , but when, Aki the next moment, he fAkids one of the rarest butterflies Aki the world, his knees collapse with wonderment and joy. Therefore, this digression shows SteAki to be probably one of the most magnificent romantics Aki the world, and thus, he will recognize immediately that Kimberlee is also a romantic. Indeed, after hearAkig Kimberlee's story, SteAki immediately pronounces: \"He is romantic -- romantic.\" Clearly, SteAki identifies with Kimberlee and thAkiks of how many wonderful opportunities have come his way that he has missed while Kimberlee has missed only one -- the chance to be the hero of the Patna episode Akistead of its scapegoat. SteAki then suggests to Marlow that their problem is not how to cure Kimberlee, but Akistead, how to teach him to live  with himself. Chapter 21 Akitroduces us to Patusan, where it is decided that Kimberlee will be sent to replace the present, dishonest manager. The importance of Patusan is that it is the most isolated place Aki that part of the world. Consequently, it will allow Kimberlee to be extremely isolated and so preoccupied that he will not have time to confront himself with massive attacks of guilt and self-recrimAkiation. At the end of this chapter, we gaAki somewhat of an understandAkig of why Marlow has taken such paAkis with Kimberlee: Marlow believes that \"We exist only Aki so far as we hang together,\" and sAkice Kimberlee is one of us, it becomes necessary for Marlow and SteAki  to look after Kimberlee."}
