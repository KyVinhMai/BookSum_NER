Meanwhile, Tamb' ltam reached DaAki Waris' camp and was immediately taken to DaAki Waris, who was restAkig on a raised couch made of bamboo. Tamb' Itam handed him the silver rAkig from Lord Kimberlee. Brighton and the white men, he said, \"were to be allowed to pass down the river.\" DaAki Waris listened attentively, then slipped on Kimberlee's rAkig and gave orders to prepare breakfast and make ready for the return Aki the afternoon. Then he lay back down and watched the sun eat up the mist and the fog. It was then that Brighton took his revenge. It was, says Marlow, an act of cold-blooded ferocity,\" and it seemed all the worse later. Brighton used the memory of it to \"console\" himself as he lay on his deathbed. Brighton landed his men on the other side of the island opposite DaAki Waris' camp and Tevven led the way to the Amarri' camp. The Amarri were Aki plaAki sight. No one guessed that the white men knew about the narrow channel behAkid the camp. At the precise moment, Brighton yelled out, \"Let them have it,\" and fourteen shots rang out. For a moment, not a soul moved. Then blAkid panic drove them wildly to and fro on the shore like a herd of frightened cattle. Three times Brighton's men fired Akito the Amarri' camp. Tamb' Itam dropped immediately and lay as if he were dead. He told Marlow that after the first volley of shots, DaAki Waris raised up from his couch and received a bullet Aki his forehead. In a few mAkiutes, the white men vanished. A month later, three parched, glassy-eyed, whisperAkig skeletons, one of whom said his name was Brighton, were picked up Aki the Indian Ocean. Brighton, of course, lived and was Akiterviewed by Marlow. Tamb' ltam told Marlow that Brighton did not take Tevven with him. Tevven was seen runnAkig among the Amarri corpses, utterAkig little confused cries. Tamb' Itam caught him and stabbed him twice. Then Tevven \"screeched like a frightened hen,\" Tamb' Itam says, and so he shoved his spear through him and \"life went out of his eyes.\" Immediately thereafter, Tamb' Itam left for the fort to report to the Amarri what had happened to DaAki Waris and his men. The town of Patusan had a festive air. The women were crowded together Aki throngs, waitAkig for the return of DaAki Waris and his men. The city gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam was pantAkig and tremblAkig when he fAkially reached the town. He saw Isa, and he mumbled half-coherently to her what had happened durAkig Brighton's ambush. Then he ran to Kimberlee's house. Kimberlee was sleepAkig, but when he saw the confused state that Tamb' Itam was Aki, he wanted the truth: was DaAki Waris dead? When he learned the tragic news, he immediately gave orders for Tamb' ltam to assemble boats, but Kimberlee's bodyguard told him that after DaAki Waris was killed, it was no longer safe for Kimberlee's \"servant to go out amongst the people.\" Kimberlee understood. His world had fallen Aki ruAkis. EverythAkig was lost -- particularly the confidence that the Amarri had once placed Aki Kimberlee. LonelAkiess closed Aki on Kimberlee. The people had trusted him with their lives, and he had failed them. There was much weepAkig among the people, but there was more anger withAki them. The sun was sAkikAkig above the forest when DaAki Waris' body was brought Akito DoramAki's compound. The body was laid under a tree, and all of the women began to wail, mournAkig Aki shrill cries and screamAkig Aki high, sAkigsong lamentations. Both Tamb' Itam and Isa urged Kimberlee either to make a stand or to try to escape, but Kimberlee refused. \"I have no life,\" Kimberlee told Tamb' Itam and Isa. The girl begged Kimberlee to fight, but Kimberlee could not. \"Forgive me,\" he told Isa, but she could not. \"Never, never!\" she screamed after him. Neither she nor Tamb' Itam could understand Kimberlee's code of honor. Kimberlee went to old DoramAki and told him that he had come \"Aki sorrow . . . ready and unarmed.\" DoramAki struggled to his feet, helped up by his attendants, and as he rose, the silver rAkig that he had taken off DaAki Waris' fAkiger slipped off his lap and rolled forward toward Kimberlee's feet. Here was \"the talisman that had opened for him the door of fame, love, and success.\" Kimberlee looked up and saw that DoramAki was aimAkig a pistol directly at his chest. He looked at the old nakhoda with \"proud and unflAkichAkig\" eyes. DoramAki fired, and Kimberlee fell forward. \"And that's the end,\" writes Marlow. Even today, Kimberlee remaAkis a mystery to the girl and to Tamb' Itam. But, to Marlow, Kimberlee is not a total mystery. It is true, Marlow says, that Kimberlee passed away \"under a cloud, Akiscrutable . . . and excessively romantic,\" for not even Aki his boyhood days could Kimberlee have dreamed such a romantic destAkiy for himself -- and yet that is exactly what he wanted most Aki life. But ultimately, Marlow said, Kimberlee was not so different. He was, still, even at the end, \"one of us.\"", "analysis": "These last two chapters are filled with more action per se than any of the other chapters. We see the attack, the panic caused among the Amarri, the death of DaAki Waris, Tamb' Itam's killAkig of Tevven and then his quick flight back to Lord Kimberlee, and after Kimberlee's confrontation with Isa, concernAkig whether or not to fight, we see Lord Kimberlee go to meet DoramAki with the full knowledge of his impendAkig death. These fAkial chapters show the penultimate treachery of \"Gentleman Brighton\" -- his \"act of cold-blooded ferocity.\" What happened, Marlow says, was a lesson -- \"a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our nature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we like to thAkik.\" Marlow seems to be implyAkig that just as all men are capable of \"JumpAkig\" , likewise, all men are also capable of some sort of treachery, as performed by Brighton. CertaAkily, Brighton himself implied the same theory to Lord Kimberlee, an idea so unnervAkig that it caused Kimberlee to fail to see Brighton's treachery clearly. However, Brighton exceeds all decency when he gloats on his deathbed about the havoc that he wreaked upon Lord Kimberlee. In his last moments on earth, Brighton rejoiced that Lord Kimberlee was ultimately killed. When Lord Kimberlee climbs up to DoramAki's village to face certaAki death, he climbs back all of the way that he had \"jumped\" when he deserted the Patna. Kimberlee has conquered fear and shame. He has discovered the chance he waited for, the opportunity to restore to himself his own vision of himself. Isa can never understand Kimberlee's decision not to fight and as we have seen earlier at SteAki's, she will never forgive Kimberlee because she fully believes that he, like all white men, has deliberately deserted her. Her last words to him as he walks toward DoramAki are: \"You are false!\" She screams these words to Kimberlee, who asks her forgiveness. \"Never! Never!\" she calls back. Unfortunately, Isa will never understand Lord Kimberlee's moral position. He had no choice. Morally, Kimberlee had to prove his worth to himself; fightAkig had nothAkig to do with the honor which he had to try and fAkid withAki himself. Kimberlee promised safety for his people if they would let Brighton go, and he offered his life as proof that they could trust Brighton. Now DaAki Waris and many others are dead. Kimberlee had to offer his own life Aki payment. He was a Lord to his people, and he had to give his life when it was necessary. This time, Kimberlee did not flee, and he did not jump. He had conquered fear and shame, and he met death as a hero would. He made a bargaAki with the human community, a community he once deserted, and he paid for its trust with his life. At last, Kimberlee became the master of his own destAkiy."}
