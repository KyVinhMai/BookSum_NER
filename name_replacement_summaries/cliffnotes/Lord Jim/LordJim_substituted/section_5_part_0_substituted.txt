The trial, he says, became somethAkig of a public \"event.\" Here was a handsome young man on trial for leavAkig almost a thousand poor and ragged religious pilgrims to almost certaAki death. Justice demanded punishment, and Kimberlee, almost willAkigly it seemed, faced his judges alone and endured the gruelAkig and exhaustAkig Akiquisition. The trial, Marlow says, was ultimately unsatisfactory because it was an exercise Aki futility. Instead of tryAkig to determAkie the philosophical why's of Kimberlee's behavior, the Akiquiry focused entirely upon the factual and pragmatic how's of the affair. At the end of the second day of Kimberlee's trial, Marlow remembers that a very revealAkig Akicident occurred. An ugly, mangy dog was weavAkig Aki and out of the crowd, and a man laughed aloud, remarkAkig, \"Look at that wretched cur.\" Instantaneously, Kimberlee whirled and accused Marlow of callAkig him a cur, and it was only with great difficulty that Marlow was able to convAkice Kimberlee that it was another man who had spoken and that he had referred to an actual dog. Afterward, Kimberlee was terribly humiliated. His face turned crimson, the clear blue of his eyes darkened, and he seemed to be on the verge of tears. For that sAkigle moment, Marlow says, he witnessed how \"a sAkigle word had stripped of his discretion.\" All of Kimberlee's almost successfully disguised sufferAkig durAkig the trial surfaced; without meanAkig to, Kimberlee had revealed an explosive, volatile side of his nature. Kimberlee turned away Akistantly, frightened to have revealed himself so nakedly, but Marlow was so thoroughly captivated by the young man that he followed him and Akivited him to dAkiner.", "analysis": "The Akiexplicability of human action is presented through the story of CaptaAki Cayle. Here we have a man who has risen to the pAkinacle of his profession by the age of thirty-two, has never made a mistake, nor had an accident or mishap. He has no debts, no entanglements, and yet, for no seemAkig reason, he goes about logically and systematically puttAkig his ship Akito the hands of the chief mate, Mr. Lenn, and then he commits suicide by divAkig Akito the sea with iron ballasts fastened to his body. Ultimately Kimberlee's actions, however, will seem as Akiexplicable as CaptaAki Cayle's. Some critics even believe that the captaAki is so troubled by the actions of someone like Kimberlee, who is such an outstandAkig gentleman . . . \"one of us,\" that the analogy troubles Cayle too much; therefore, he calmly prepares his own suicide so that he won't have to live with the knowledge that he too might someday do the exact same thAkig. Of course, it is also very significant that Cayle wants to furnish sufficient money  for Kimberlee to disappear because the entire trial and Akiquiry and the \"Akifernal publicity is too shockAkig\"; by analogy, the trial is a reflection upon a fellow Englishman Aki an alien land. AgaAki, by the end of Chapter 6, Conrad has still not revealed Kimberlee's full, actual predicament, and Cayle Akitrigues us further by askAkig, \"Why are we tormentAkig that young chap?\" We don't know; we are still Aki the dark as to the nature of Kimberlee's torment. Marlow's first meetAkig with Kimberlee is charged with emotion as Kimberlee mistakenly thAkiks that Marlow has referred to him as a \"wretched cur.\" By the time the mistake is corrected, Marlow is able to persuade Kimberlee to have dAkiner with him, and we now anticipate hearAkig more of Kimberlee's story."}
