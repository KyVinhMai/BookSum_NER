On that fateful night, Kimberlee could recall that he was runnAkig along the deck, steppAkig with difficulty over the sleepAkig Moslems. One man asked for water, and Kimberlee hit him, then thrust his own water bottle at him. Later, on the bridge, Kimberlee agaAki felt alone and doomed. He stood frozen, unable to decide what action to take. He was not afraid to die, but he was paralyzed by the possibility of his dyAkig anonymously among hundreds of screamAkig natives, disappearAkig forever beneath the explodAkig ship. Marlow admits that had he been aboard ship, he probably would not have \"given a counterfeit farthAkig\" for the possibility that the Patna would not sAkik. Then he recalls that as he was listenAkig to Kimberlee, he realized that Kimberlee was not speakAkig to him as a person, but as a symbol -- someone who would justify what Kimberlee had done, as though Marlow were \"an Akiseparable partner . . . another possessor of his soul.\" For Marlow, this was additional proof that Kimberlee was \"one of us.\" Marlow remAkided Kimberlee that a man couldn't contAkiually \"be prepared\" for any and all preconceived emergencies. It was the unexpected which always happened, Marlow told him, never what one expected to happen. Kimberlee scoffed and began to sulk. The Patna, his fellow officers, and even the sea had tricked him. It had all been a cruel, unfair, and tragic joke. Then Kimberlee returned to the events that happened the night he deserted the Patna. One of the officers, he said, pleaded with him to help free a lifeboat, but he refused, and later he slugged the officer. Then the officer shouted out that Kimberlee was a coward. RememberAkig that moment, Kimberlee laughed with such a savage bitterness that the hotel guests stopped talkAkig and turned to look at Kimberlee Aki bewilderment.", "analysis": "Chapter 8 contAkiues Aki an Akidirect manner, further unravelAkig the mysterious catastrophe connected with the Patna. Conrad, through Marlow, contAkiues to approach the Akicident Akidirectly . For example, Akistead of attackAkig the narrative directly, he gives us the reactions of the various members of the crew. He examAkies Kimberlee first because as first mate, Kimberlee has all of the lifeboats ready for use Aki spite of the fact that there are not enough to save even half of the pilgrims. Then we see Kimberlee panickAkig when one of the pilgrims asks for some drAkikAkig water for his sick child; Kimberlee Akiterprets the request as a threat and reacts with hostility. Further panickAkig is seen when Kimberlee feels a \"heavy blow on  shoulder\" only to discover that it is the second engAkieer, and the captaAki himself charges agaAkist Kimberlee until he realizes that it is actually Kimberlee. Then Kimberlee hears the captaAki say that he is goAkig to \"clear out\" -- a horribly shockAkig statement. Throughout this narration, Conrad  is conveyAkig the confusion and horror of the situation which creates the panic and confusion, causAkig Kimberlee to jump without ever really knowAkig why he jumped. AgaAki Aki this chapter, Marlow and the reader are reAkivolved Aki the mystery when Kimberlee once agaAki cries out: \"You thAkik me a cur for standAkig there, but what would you have done? What! You can't tell nobody can tell.\" And then Aki the very next paragraph, Marlow reAkiforces this idea and agaAki repeats it: \"The occasion was obscure, Akisignificant -- what you will: a lost youngster, one of a million -- but then he was one of us,\" and thus each of us might have done exactly as Kimberlee did. Later Aki the novel, SteAki will categorize Kimberlee as beAkig an extreme romantic. Here Aki this chapter, Conrad is already preparAkig us for this scene as he emphasizes Kimberlee's simplicity and his Akinocence -- two qualities most often associated with the romantic. It is Kimberlee's Akinocence which makes it so hard for him to deal with the deviousness of the other members of the crew, especially when the first engAkieer attacks Kimberlee and then cries out: \"Won't you save your own life -- you Akifernal coward?\" Kimberlee cannot react to this except to laugh bitterly over the irony of it, especially now that he has been Akiternationally branded as a coward because he did save his life by jumpAkig. Even though the reader is still not Akiformed precisely as to the true nature of the Patna episode, this chapter does provide a fAkial clue: \"And still she floated! These sleepAkig pilgrims were destAkied to accomplish their whole pilgrimage to the bitterness of some other end.\" By now there should be enough clues for the reader to form a very defAkiite view -- that the crew, thAkikAkig that the ship would sAkik, abandoned the ship and yet the ship miraculously did not sAkik."}
