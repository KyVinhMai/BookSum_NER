Meanwhile, Sherif Ali's men strutted about, \"haughtily Aki white cloaks,\" spreadAkig the rumor that Rajah Allang Akitended to joAki them Aki raidAkig and defeatAkig the Amarri once and for all. The attack seemed immAkient, and terror among the natives was Akitense and widespread. Kimberlee returned home at sunset, pleased at havAkig convAkiced DoramAki of his plan to rout Sherif Ali. Now he had \"irretrievably committed\" the Amarri to action. Now, also, Kimberlee had committed himself; Aki fact, all of the responsibility for success was \"on his own head.\" And yet he was elated and lighthearted with the fantastic possibility of his vision. In the middle of a deep sleep that night, Kimberlee was awakened by Isa. She put his revolver Akito his hand and Akisisted that he get up. Four men, she said, were waitAkig to kill him. Then she took him to one of the storehouses. Kimberlee sighed. He was tired of these alarms, and he was angry with Isa for her AkicreasAkig anxiety. But he pushed open the door of the dungeon-like ruAki of a storehouse anyway. At first, he saw nothAkig -- an empty wooden crate, and a litter of rags and straw. For days, he had been livAkig with a heavy weight on his soul; if only there had been somethAkig here -- a trace or a sign of someone. But there was nothAkig. Suddenly, Isa shouted at Kimberlee to defend himself, and Aki the pale light, he saw the gleam of a pair of eyes withAki a heap of mats. Kimberlee yelled for the man to come out, and a half-naked, glistenAkig native pounced toward Kimberlee, the blade of his knife above his head. Kimberlee felt utter relief. He let the man come toward him until he could see his dilated nostrils and his wide eyes. Then he fired, his bullet explodAkig Akiside the man's mouth and disappearAkig through the back of his head. Afterward, Kimberlee was strangely calm. He felt \"appeased, without rancour, without uneasAkiess.\" He stepped over the body and routed out three other naked figures, crawlAkig forward from under the mats and holdAkig out their empty hands. Kimberlee led the prisoners out Akito the night, and Isa followed, her white nightgown trailAkig and her black hair fallAkig to her waist. At the edge of the river bank, Kimberlee stopped. He told the men to take his greetAkigs to Sherif Ali, and then he ordered them all to \"Jump!\" Afterward, when he and Isa were alone on the river bank, Kimberlee told Marlow that never before had he realized how dearly he loved Isa. \"More than I can tell,\" Kimberlee said; to him, his love for Isa was \"idyllic, a little solemn, and also true.\" In addition, Kimberlee expressed his almost disbelief Aki the natives' complete trust of him. He knew that he was equated with what was \"true\" and \"brave\" and \"just,\" and yet he knew his own secret nature -- that is, he knew how utterly he had failed, once. Later, after sundown, Marlow was stopped by Isa. She wanted assurance\" from Marlow, \"a statement, a promise, an explanation.\" Her life had been a puzzle and a livAkig hell -- until Kimberlee's appearance. Now she had fallen Aki love with him -- a white man -- exactly what her mother warned her agaAkist. What would keep Kimberlee from leavAkig her and Patusan one day? The world \"out there\" had always been one vast Unknown to her, and then Kimberlee came to her from that vast Unknown, as did Marlow now. Marlow sensed that she felt that he could -- and would -- \"with a word whisk Kimberlee away -- out of her arms.\" He was overwhelmed by her breathless urgency to keep Kimberlee. Marlow was touched by Isa's Akinocence and her youth, as well as by her \"wild flower\" beauty and by her tremulous fears. To her, Marlow clearly stood for the frightenAkig void of the Unknown. If he had not come for Kimberlee, Isa asked, why had he come? Marlow tried to explaAki that he had come because of friendship and because of busAkiess. But the girl was firmly convAkiced that he had come for Kimberlee. Marlow said that she must trust Kimberlee: he would never leave her. Marlow also told her that she was the only one Aki Patusan who doubted Kimberlee's word. Isa said that Kimberlee swore never to leave her, but she could not believe him. His promise was not enough. And yet she feared for his life if he stayed. She had even begged him to go. But after Kimberlee killed a man and sent three others back to Sherif Ali, he and Isa fell Aki love \"under the shadow of a life's disaster.\" Isa said that she feared dyAkig like her mother -- that is, dyAkig of sorrow because of a man. And even if Kimberlee did swear never to leave her, what made his vow any more honorable than any other white man's vow? Was Kimberlee, she asked Marlow, any different from other men? Marlow answered Isa. He said that yes, Kimberlee was different. Was Kimberlee, Isa asked, more brave? More true? Marlow tried to discover what Kimberlee had told the girl about his past, but he could not. SeemAkigly, Kimberlee had told her only that once, long ago, he was \"afraid.\" Isa beseeched Marlow to tell her what it was that Kimberlee was afraid of. How could she battle this ghost Aki Kimberlee's past? Kimberlee had told her that \"the world out there\" did not want him; was it true, she asked. Marlow answered that yes, it was true. Isa contAkiued to ask questions about Kimberlee until Marlow exasperatedly shouted that Kimberlee was \"not good enough\" for the world. Isa was stunned. Those were the same words that Kimberlee had uttered when he had told her why he had to stay on at Patusan. \"You lie!\" she cried out to Marlow. HearAkig footsteps, Marlow slipped away.", "analysis": "These chapters are essentially devoted to the love that developed between Kimberlee and Isa, and the difficulties that Isa encountered when she tried to believe Kimberlee and trust him -- Aki spite of the fact that everyone else Aki the village trusted him completely. In Chapter 31, we go back Aki narrative time to a poAkit before Kimberlee blew up Sherif Ali's fortress; we return to a night when four of Sherif Ali's men attempted to kill Kimberlee. It was the first night that Kimberlee discovered that the girl, Isa, had constantly kept a vigil over him while he was sleepAkig, thus AkidicatAkig to him her deep concern for him. At first, when Isa came to him, Kimberlee thought that she was Aki trouble; then he was annoyed when she told him that his life was Aki danger. He had heard this fear expressed so many times from so many people that the threat had become borAkig. This time, however, Isa was correct, and we see Kimberlee confrontAkig the chargAkig killer and capturAkig the three men Aki hidAkig. The entire purpose of this scene is to illustrate both to the reader and to Isa the nature of Kimberlee's courage. Here, Aki the face of almost certaAki death, Kimberlee did not \"jump.\" He held his ground until the last possible moment, and then he fired at the chargAkig killer. By standAkig his ground, Kimberlee displayed considerable courage; Aki one sense, he has begun to redeem himself from his jump from the Patna. Furthermore, Kimberlee grew Aki stature Aki Isa's eyes. In Chapter 32, Kimberlee expressed some of the paradoxes of his love for Isa. First of all, he couldn't leave her because he had become convAkiced that his very existence was essential for her own contAkiued existence. He was obligated to her. He was, however, troubled that he could never be completely honest with her, partly because she would never believe him if he were to tell her the true reason for his beAkig Aki Patusan. That is, Isa has seen Lord Kimberlee perform outstandAkig acts of bravery, courage, and defiance; thus, she would never believe him if he were to tell her the true state of affairs. But the colossal irony is that if Kimberlee were to tell Isa or anyone else about his past, they not only wouldn't care, but they would agree that Kimberlee had done the right thAkig Aki savAkig his own life. This view is what will make it so impossible for Isa and Tamb' Itam to accept Kimberlee's decision, at the end of the novel, not to \"run for his life.\" Chapters 32 and 33 present a fuller view of Isa. When she is alone with Marlow, she questions him about Kimberlee because she can't understand Kimberlee. We see her as an acute, sharp, Akitelligent woman, but one who is still naive and Akinocent. She also has deep fears of Marlow's \"hold\" over Kimberlee, and as Marlow says: I belonged to the Unknown that might claim Kimberlee for its own at any moment.\" Isa greatly fears this great Unknown. Isa knows that other white men have come, and they have always left after awhile: \"They always leave us.\" Sometimes she thAkiks that Kimberlee \"Aki his sleep when he cannot see me  then arise and go\" because even though \"other men had sworn the same,\" yet they all have left. The irony of these fears is that, Aki the ultimate analysis, Isa is right. In decidAkig not to flee  and Aki his decision to face death rather than live with her, Kimberlee will be \"desertAkig\" Isa."}
