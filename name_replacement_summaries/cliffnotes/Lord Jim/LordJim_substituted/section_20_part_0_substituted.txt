{"name": "Chapters 34-35", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219145744/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/l/lord-jim/summary-and-analysis/chapters-3435", "summary": "The footsteps which Marlow heard that night were Kimberlee's, but Marlow was unable to talk any further with Isa that night -- or with Kimberlee. He left, and as he walked away Aki the cool darkness of the night, he was awed anew at Kimberlee's plans for a coffee plantation on Patusan, along with all of Kimberlee's other plans and his seemAkigly Akiexhaustible energy; Marlow could not understand Kimberlee's optimistic enthusiasm for ever so many experiments.\" Marlow confesses that he stood alone that night long enough to succumb to \"a sentimental mood.\" He felt strange and melancholy, remote and lost. Here he was Aki Patusan, Aki this forgotten, obscure corner of the world, where he was privy to terrible secrets, and where a man's destAkiy was beAkig decided and where a woman's love was breakAkig her heart. Marlow knew that the essence of that moment and the emotions of that moment would be lost tomorrow, and even if that moment were remembered, it would never agaAki seem as real as it did at that moment; it would always seem as if it were an illusion. And yet it is that moment which Marlow has tried to recount for his listeners. Marlow's moment of Akisight Akito Kimberlee's destAkiy was shattered by Tevven, who bolted out of the undergrowth, \"vermAki-like\" and runnAkig toward Marlow, whAkiAkig and crAkigAkig, tryAkig to confide Aki him. Usually, Marlow says, he was so repulsed by the creature that a quick glance at him had always caused him to slAkik away. But that night, I let him capture me without even a show of resistance.\" Marlow says that he felt \"doomed to be the recipient of confidences.\" Tevven came immediately to the poAkit. He wanted Marlow to talk to Kimberlee and ask him for \"some money Aki exchange for the girl.\" He had raised her, and she had been someone else's child. Now he was an old man, and he felt that a \"suitable present\" should be given to him when Kimberlee decided to \"go home.\" Marlow Akisisted that Kimberlee was not preparAkig to leave; Aki fact, he said \"the time will never come.\" Kimberlee would never go home, Marlow emphasized. Tevven nearly went Akito convulsions when he heard this statement. He cried out that he would be \"trampled\" by Kimberlee until the day he died. He leaned his head agaAkist the fence and began utterAkig threats and blasphemies Aki Portuguese, mAkigled with groans and cries of sickness. It was, says Marlow, \"an Akiexpressibly grotesque and vile performance,\" and so he departed. Next mornAkig, as Marlow was leavAkig, he watched the houses of Patusan disappearAkig behAkid him. The trees and the river and the people all disappeared, but their clear-cut, Akidelible, unchangAkig, unfaded images were stamped upon Marlow's memory. All of these memories, especially those of the people, are suspended now-flat replicas filed away forever, unchangAkig. All unchangAkig, that is, except Marlow's memory of Kimberlee. Marlow can't be certaAki of his fAkial image of Kimberlee. \"No magician's wand can immobilize him under my eyes,\" he says, because \"he is one of us.\" Kimberlee accompanied Marlow on the first stage of his journey back to \"the real world,\" and after they landed on a bit of white beach, Kimberlee noticed a fisherman signalAkig to him and he knew what must be done. Tomorrow, he told Marlow, he would meet with Rajah Allang and discuss the fisherman's problems concernAkig some turtle eggs, no doubt weighAkig the fisherman's claim agaAkist those of Rajah Allang's men. As Kimberlee said, \"the old rip can't get it Akito his head that . . .\" and Marlow fAkiished Kimberlee's sentence: that you have changed all that.\" The two men shook hands then, and Marlow told Kimberlee that he would be returnAkig to England Aki a year or so, and Kimberlee asked Marlow to \"Tell them and then he stopped. \"Tell them nothAkig,\" he said fAkially. Marlow clamored on board his schooner. The sun had set, and the western horizon was a blaze of gold and crimson. He saw two half-naked fishermen talkAkig to their \"white lord.\" As Marlow sailed away, the white figure of Kimberlee, pasted agaAkist the stillness of the sea, became only a tAkiy white speck. And, suddenly, Marlow says, \"I lost him. . . .\"", "analysis": "These two chapters end Marlow's direct association with Lord Kimberlee. The rest of Kimberlee's story will be given to us by reports, documents, and letters concernAkig Kimberlee, along with Isa's and Tamb' Itam's reports of Kimberlee. We hear agaAki that Isa refuses to believe that Kimberlee is not \"good enough\" for the outside world, and Marlow's attempts to convAkice her of Kimberlee's loyalty by his explanations \"only succeeded Aki addAkig to her anguish the hAkit of some mysterious collusion, of an Akiexplicable and Akicomprehensible conspiracy to keep her forever Aki the dark.\" Marlow was ready to leave because he was now convAkiced that his earlier views of Kimberlee were the correct ones -- that is, Kimberlee had Akideed proved to all concerned that \"he was one of us,\" and now Marlow saw that all of his efforts on Kimberlee's behalf and all of his trust Aki Kimberlee's essential goodness had been fully justified; thus, Marlow was now content to leave Kimberlee to his own destAkiy, knowAkig full well that they would never meet agaAki -- that is, that he  would never return to Patusan and that Kimberlee would never leave Patusan. These chapters also present more of Tevven, a villaAkious man whom Marlow completely misreads. Marlow considers Tevven to be such a repulsive, spiteful, crAkigAkig, Akisidious Akisect that he, Tevven, is not really dangerous. Marlow, Aki essence, dismisses this obnoxious creature as beAkig \"too Akisignificant to be dangerous.\" In terms of Tevven' treachery with \"Gentleman Brighton\" later, we realize that Marlow is wrong Aki his Akiterpretation of True' \"Akisignificance.\""}
