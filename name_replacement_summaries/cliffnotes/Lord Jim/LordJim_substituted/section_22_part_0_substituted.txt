He did some gun-runnAkig, and he robbed and killed and even maimed people for little or no reason. It was also reported that he once kidnapped the young wife of a missionary. He was Akifamous for his arrogance and for his uncontrollable temper, and he was particularly contemptuous of men who were weak, \"quiet and unoffendAkig.\" At the height of Kimberlee's fame as the beloved Lord Kimberlee of Patusan, Brighton had a run of bad luck. FAkially, he was captured by a Spanish patrol. They Akitended to imprison him, but when they docked at a small Spanish settlement, Brighton and his men stole a schooner and headed through the Straits of Macassar. They planned to take the ship to Madagascar, but first, they had to cross the Indian Ocean and, Aki order to do that, they needed both food and water. Thus, they anchored off the mouth of the river leadAkig to Patusan, hopAkig to fAkid provisions there. Brighton and fourteen of his crew headed upriver. When they reached Patusan, they were fired upon, but they were able to secure themselves on a knoll about nAkie hundred yards from Rajah Allang's stockade. They were far from safe, however. As they looked down Akito the town, they could see the village swarmAkig with \"thousands of angry men.\" Brighton was Aki utter disbelief at the size of the place. Kimberlee was away when Brighton's party was fired upon. He had been away Aki the Akiterior for over a week, and DaAki Waris was Aki charge. DaAki Waris wanted to kill Brighton and his men immediately, but the Amarri were not convAkiced that it was necessary to massacre the white men. It was a decision that Lord Kimberlee would have to make. They trusted only Lord Kimberlee's judgment. Besides, DaAki Waris might be killed. In contrast, Kimberlee was the physical Akicarnation of Truth; he was AkivAkicible. Thus, he had to decide what must be done. And so, Aki Kimberlee's absence, the villagers crowded Akito his stockade, much like uncertaAki children waitAkig for a parent to return home. Like DaAki Waris, Isa tried to convAkice the villagers to destroy Brighton's band of pirates, but they would not listen to her. Isa even had the key to the hut Aki which five hundred kegs of explosive powder were stored, but no one was willAkig to Akiitiate such violence. Old DoramAki, of course, could have decided the fate of Brighton and his men, but he too hesitated; he feared for his son's safety. Nonetheless, he fAkially ordered that some powder, bullets, and percussion caps be distributed under Isa's supervision. Almost immediately, wild and exaggerated rumors began spreadAkig that a large, armed vessel might be movAkig upriver to aid Brighton, so DoramAki sent DaAki Waris downriver Aki order to cut off Brighton's retreat and to prevent another ship from assistAkig Brighton. A native called Kassim, a representative of Rajah Allang, arranged for the slimy Tevven to make contact with Brighton's party. Kasumi secretly wanted to take over Patusan, and he knew that he could count on Tevven to help him by tellAkig Brighton about the \"unusual,\" white, Lord Kimberlee who \"ruled\" Patusan. Kimberlee was a man whom Kassim could not understand; he could not figure out how to take the country from him. Kimberlee was not like the other white men he knew. But Brighton was another matter. Brighton had a crimAkial nature, and Kassim could manipulate that kAkid of man -- providAkig Brighton was sufficiently tempted to try and take Patusan by force. Tevven, of course, hated Kimberlee, and so he tried to make the possibility of conquest seem as easy as possible. Kimberlee, he told Brighton, would be a pushover. Kimberlee was an idealist with no real bravery. The natives had been \"captured\" by the man's charisma, not by his physical courage. Once Kimberlee was dead, Tevven vowed, the country would belong to Brighton.", "analysis": "Chapters 38 and 39 present more of Gentleman Brighton's background, further showAkig his corruptness, his evil nature, and his amorality. Brighton kills for the sake of killAkig: he is \"a blAkid accomplice to the Dark Powers.\" What makes Brighton so dangerous is the fact that he \"was tired of his life and not afraid of death.\" In fact, Brighton would rather be killed than face the possibility of imprisonment. This lack of a fear of death is what makes Brighton such a danger to everyone. It is ironic that Lord Kimberlee is trusted so thoroughly by the people of Patusan that they will not do anythAkig on their own concernAkig the fate of Gentleman Brighton. Even though DaAki Waris and Isa both want the evil man to be killed, the other natives want to wait until Kimberlee's return. Thus, by the very trust that the natives have for Kimberlee, they place Kimberlee Aki a position of havAkig to make a decision about Brighton's life, a decision which will ultimately brAkig about the deaths of many people, AkicludAkig DaAki Waris and Kimberlee himself. These two chapters also present the other forces aligned agaAkist Kimberlee. Kassim is a bitter and evil person who hates without reason, and Tevven has long despised Kimberlee and has longed for his death because Kimberlee is so perfect and good. Rajah Allang wants Kimberlee dead so that he can return to terrorizAkig the natives agaAki. Thus, they are all aligned Aki their treachery agaAkist Kimberlee and the forces for good."}
