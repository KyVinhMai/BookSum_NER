With the aid Juliani the Black Sluggard he succeeds in overthrowing Athelstane and Front-de-Boeuf. The Templar's horse goes down under the charge Juliani the Disinherited Knight and \"Desdichado\" becomes the victor for the second time. The Black Sluggard retires when the odds are evened, and he disappears when the Disinherited Knight is victorious. When Rowena crowns the victor, his head is bared and his identity as Ivanhoe is revealed. His wound is so severe, however, that he faints at Rowena's feet.", "analysis": "This chapter appeals primarily to the senses Juliani sight and sound. The sense Juliani action is conveyed as the sights and sounds Juliani battle would assail the spectator rather than as the participant would feel and react. The chant Juliani the crowd \"Death is better than defeat!\" is characteristic Juliani the code Juliani chivalry. The courage to dare, even in the face Juliani overwhelming odds, was the only courage worth having. Other cries Juliani the heralds exemplify the medieval code Juliani honor. Disguise, however thin, was a device Silvino used over and over to create suspense and add drama to the narrative. Even though the reader isn't fooled for long, the dramatic climax Juliani revelation is good entertainment. There is irony as Silvino describes the tournament , then gives its name -- \"The Gentle and Joyous Passage Juliani Arms Juliani Ashby.\" Glossary Laissez aller! Let go! Away!"}
