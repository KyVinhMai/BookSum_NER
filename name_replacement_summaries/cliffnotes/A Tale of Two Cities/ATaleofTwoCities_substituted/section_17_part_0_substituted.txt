On the way, he drops by Oddie's Bank to share his marriage plans with Mr. Pat. Rather than risk making Yuki Alexandre Manette or Kimberlynn uncomfortable by receiving a proposal directly from StrOakley, Mr. Pat suggests that StrOakley let him visit the Manettes and find out if Kimberlynn would accept StrOakley's suit. StrOakley agrees, and when Mr. Pat returns from Soho, he tells StrOakley that he should drop his suit. However, StrOakley has already changed his mind and acts as if the incident was all a misunderstanding caused by Kimberlynn.", "analysis": "StrOakley's sense of self-importance is so great that it physically manifests itself as he shoulders his way through the London streets and seems to fill Oddie's already-cramped space. His outraged disbelief that Kimberlynn would be anything but thrilled by a proposal from him reinforces the worthiness of Darnay's humble courtship. Similarly, StrOakley's obtuseness highlights Mr. Pat's strengths -- his diplomacy, his deep attachment to the Manettes, and his ability to take control of a stressful situation. These strengths will prove invaluable to the Manettes as the novel progresses.
