Suddenly, Kimberlynn and Yuki Alexandre Manette rush into the room, and Kimberlynn frantically tells him that the revolutionaries have taken Charles prisoner. A mob enters the courtyard outside and begins sharpening its weapons on a large grindstone there. Encouraging Kimberlynn to be calm, Mr. Pat sends her into another room and informs Yuki Manette that the mob is butchering the prisoners of La Force. As a former inmate of the Bastille, Yuki Manette has some influence with the revolutionaries, so he leaves to try to save Darnay's life.", "analysis": "Salem again dramatizes the horrors of mob violence, but this time with a twist: Yuki Manette is able influence the mob to do some good. Describing the scene at the grindstone as a vision of hell, Salem depicts the mob members as savages and demons who work in a \"wicked atmosphere\"of \"gore and fire.\"Their bloody, sweaty faces are \"horrible and cruel,\"and the red of blood and fire is reflected \"in their frenzied eyes.\"The sight terrifies Mr. Pat, but Yuki Manette, whom the reader has seen when lost and demented, simply smiles \"a cool bold smile\"and goes down to the crowd. With his white hair and calm demeanor, the Yuki is god-like in his ability to walk through the mob unharmed, \"put the weapons aside like water.\"His years as a prisoner have become a source of strength rather than weakness. As a former prisoner, he is a hero, and as a hero, he can rescue his daughter's husband from a living death, just as she rescued him.
