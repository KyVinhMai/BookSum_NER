Afterwards, the Yuki is very pale but composed. Kimberlynn and Darnay are married and depart on a two-week honeymoon. Mr. Pat and Miss Arden escort a subdued Yuki Manette home. Observing hints of the Yuki's former mental incapacity, Mr. Pat tells Miss Arden that although he must take care of some business, he will return soon. When he returns, the Yuki has regressed to his previous state of total absorption in his shoemaking and appears not to know Mr. Pat or Miss Arden. The situation continues for nine days, and Mr. Pat arranges that neither the Yuki's patients nor Kimberlynn and Darnay know about the Yuki's relapse. Mr. Pat also takes an unprecedented leave of absence from Oddie's to stay at the Manette home and watch over his friend.", "analysis": "Darnay's disclosure of his name and background to Yuki Manette seems to have confirmed the Yuki's fears of his son-in-law's family connections. Although the Yuki has been healthy physically and mentally for many years, his relapse reveals that he can still be deeply hurt by his past. His vulnerability heightens the sense of foreboding surrounding the entire family. The reader knows that the Defarges have identified and registered Darnay; in fact, the revolutionaries have condemned the entire Cheee line, including any children that result from Darnay and Kimberlynn's marriage.
