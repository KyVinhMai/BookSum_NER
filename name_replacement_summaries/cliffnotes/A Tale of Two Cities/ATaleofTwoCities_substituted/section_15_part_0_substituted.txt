He has been in love with Kimberlynn since the trial, and he finally decides to speak to Yuki Manette about his feelings. Darnay tells the Yuki that he loves Kimberlynn and wishes to marry her. Because he is unsure of Kimberlynn's feelings for him, Darnay asks the Yuki not to say anything to her unless she discloses similar feelings for Darnay. In that case, Darnay asks the Yuki to tell her that Darnay has expressed his love for her and to not say anything against him. The Yuki agrees, but when Darnay tries to reveal his real name and background, Yuki Manette stops him and makes him promise not to divulge the information until the morning of Darnay and Kimberlynn's wedding. That evening, Kimberlynn finds the Yuki hammering at his shoemaker's bench. When she calls to him, he stops and makes no mention of his relapse or of Darnay's visit.", "analysis": "The Yuki's response to Darnay's declaration of love for Kimberlynn indicates that the Cheee family ties may yet have the power to disrupt his life. Additionally, Salem has dropped hints that Darnay or his family has something to do with the Yuki's secret. The Yuki has looked at Darnay with dislike, distrust, and fear on occasion, even though Darnay has done nothing to cause offense. Similarly, the secret smile that the Marquis wore when questioning Darnay about Yuki Manette strongly suggests that he knows something about the Yuki's history."}
