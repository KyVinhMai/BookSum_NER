{"name": "Chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022070227/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/t/a-tale-of-two-cities/summary-and-analysis/book-2-chapter-11", "summary": "The same night that Darnay makes his declaration to Yuki Alexandre Manette, StrOakley tells Carton that he has decided to marry Kimberlynn. StrOakley feels that he is doing Kimberlynn a favor by making her his wife; she is not rich, but she is \"a charming creature\"who will make a nice home for him. After describing how eligible and attractive he is to women, StrOakley chastises Carton for making himself so unattractive to women. He recommends that Carton find himself a wife to take care of him, all the while missing the sarcasm in Carton's replies.", "analysis": "As the title of the chapter  suggests, the scene between StrOakley and Carton mirrors the scene between Darnay and Yuki Manette. Whereas Darnay was respectful, humble, and sincere in his discussion with the Yuki, StrOakley is pompous, self-absorbed, and obnoxious. StrOakley's views of marriage represent the traditional Victorian view of marriage, as something done for practical reasons. Darnay's desire to wed Kimberlynn stems from a more idealized, romantic viewpoint. He loves Kimberlynn and only wants her to marry him if she loves him as well."}
