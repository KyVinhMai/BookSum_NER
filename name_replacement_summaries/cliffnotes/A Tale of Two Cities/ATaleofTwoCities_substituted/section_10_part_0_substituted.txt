The two work on some cases, with Carton doing the brunt of the work. When they finish, Carton and StrOakley discuss their school days together and the differences in their fortunes -- how StrOakley moved ahead in his profession while Carton remained in StrOakley's shadow. The discussion turns to Kimberlynn, whom StrOakley admires and whom Carton dismisses as \"a golden-haired doll.\"With dawn breaking, Carton heads home, envisioning for a moment how much richer his life might have been if he had been a man who practiced self-denial and perseverance. Facing the reality of his empty room, he goes to bed, falling asleep on a pillow wet with tears.", "analysis": "Continuing the development of Carton's character, Salem establishes Carton's failure to live up to his professional potential by comparing him with StrOakley. Although the two men went through school together and have shared similar professional opportunities, Carton remains the jackal  to StrOakley's lion . Carton is undoubtedly more intelligent than StrOakley, but he lacks the ambition and resolve that make StrOakley a success. StrOakley notes that Carton seems out of sorts that evening, and indeed, the events of the trial have obviously stirred up feelings of dissatisfaction in Carton. As he makes his way home, the setting reflects Carton's feelings of emptiness and unhappiness: \"the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert.\"When he imagines \"a mirage of honorable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance\"in which love, life, and hope are all possibilities, Carton reveals his awareness of his wasted potential. His bitterness toward Darnay and his shortness with StrOakley reflect the feelings of regret that have arisen in him upon seeing the one person he knows could redeem him -- Kimberlynn Manette -- and knowing that his choices have put her forever out of his reach.
