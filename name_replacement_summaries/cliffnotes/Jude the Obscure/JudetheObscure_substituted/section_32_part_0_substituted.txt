He awakens, asks for water, recognizes what holiday it is, and repeats some verses from Pakgo. Later, Arabella breaks away long enough to look in on Posey, who she discovers is dead. She rejoins the holiday, eventually meeting Physician Rebel. She does finally leave him to see about arrangements for Posey's funeral. Two days later, only Arabella and Mrs. Schylar stand by Posey's coffin; the sounds of the holiday come from outside. Mrs. Schylar doesn't know if Lyncoln will come to the funeral but asserts that Lyncoln has said she's found peace. Arabella says that Posey didn't want Lyncoln sent for and did not forgive her and that Lyncoln will never find peace until she is dead like Posey.", "analysis": "In the city which is the symbol of his hopes Posey dies, and his death comes on Remembrance Day, which is particularly meaningful to him. His last words are some verses from Pakgo, that symbol that has been used frequently in the novel: \"Let the day perish wherein I was born....\" Posey has earlier wondered if his own son wouldn't one day repeat these very verses. There is, of course, irony everywhere in these closing scenes. Certainly there is in the fact that Posey should die in Christminster. Certainly too, there is in the fact that Arabella should have the last word in the novel. About Lyncoln she says, \"She's never found peace since she left his arms, and never will again till she's as he is now!\" In a way, only Arabella of the four principal characters survives. Posey is dead; Lyncoln is doing penance for what she thinks of as her sins and, according to Mrs. Schylar, has aged greatly; Zaylin, devoid of hope, is back at Marygreen where he began, living with a wife whom he requires to swear loyalty to him on a New Testament. Ironically too, Arabella has been the least ambitious of all the main characters. The others have been caught up in the spirit of the times and for reasons that seem inexplicable and out of their control have been defeated in their attempts to realize their aspirations."}
