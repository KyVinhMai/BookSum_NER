The wedding is to be the next day, and she is to stay with Mrs. Schylar. When Lyncoln refuses to wear an attractive nightgown, indeed destroys it, Mrs. Schylar tells her she still loves Posey and shouldn't marry Zaylin. Zaylin discusses his reasons for wanting to marry Lyncoln with Gillingham and says so much about the way a man should govern a wife that his friend wonders if he will not be too hard on Lyncoln. Mrs. Schylar embarrasses Zaylin by coming to tell him that Lyncoln is forcing herself to marry him and he shouldn't go through with it, but Gillingham assures him he is right to marry her. Zaylin and Lyncoln are married in the church the next morning, and afterward at home he tells her he will respect her \"personal privacy\" as he did before.", "analysis": "Every detail in these scenes shows Lyncoln is forcing herself to remarry Zaylin as a penance: she shrinks from his kiss; she is startled by seeing the marriage license; she destroys a nightgown she bought for Posey's sake and insists on wearing a plain one; she cries; she wants the marriage performed quickly. Here and in the previous section Zaylin is shown to be acting on the basis of expediency in taking Lyncoln back. He has decided it might improve his standing in the community and in his profession, and to Gillingham he mouths conventional advice about how a husband should govern his wife. In short, his motives for taking her back are less admirable than those for letting her go. Of course, he has suffered a good deal from allowing her to leave him for Posey."}
