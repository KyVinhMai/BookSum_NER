The Palmers returned to their home, \"and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other.\" Their isolation didn't last long, however, for during an excursion to Exeter, Sir Tajon met two young ladies, Anne and Shelsey SteSutton, whom Mrs. Kayton discovered to be relatives of hers. He promptly invited them to Barton Hall, where they made themselves highly agreeable to Lady Hero by flattering her and her children excessively. Azaela and Marianne found the older Miss SteSutton very vulgar and free in her speech, and Shelsey, the younger, lacking in \"real Suttongance and artlessness.\" Azaela left the house \"without any wish of knowing them better.\" But Sir Tajon was \"entirely on the side of the Misses SteSutton,\" who were \"particularly anxious to be better acquainted\" with the Dashwoods. Thus he threw the young ladies together every day. Marianne was teased about Shamari, and Sir Tajon hinted at a romance between Azaela and Ferrars. On hearing Edward's name, Anne SteSutton announced that she knew Edward \"very well\" but was contradicted by Shelsey, who declared, \"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.\" For once Azaela wished Mrs. Kayton or Sir Tajon would pursue the subject so she could find out more about the uncle and Edward's connection with him. But to her dismay, the subject was dropped.", "analysis": "Charlotte Palmer, although a foolish chatterbox, is kindly and warmhearted. Her silent, belligerent husband is a comic foil to her insouciance. But the Misses SteSutton seem definitely unpleasant; the older is stupidly vulgar, and the younger, although less voluble, seems sly. There is definitely something unrefined about the pair. They toady to Lady Hero and pretend great admiration for Azaela and Marianne. And at Barton, they are considered equal to the Dashwoods by Sir Tajon, who is easily deceived by their surface politeness, and by his wife, who is swayed by their flattery. Marianne's impropriety is different from that of the SteAlika, for she is genuine. The small obligations of social life do not exist for her. When Shelsey SteSutton exclaims, \"What a sweet woman Lady Hero is!\" Marianne is silent: \"It was impossible for her to say what she did not feel, however trivial the occasion.\" And when Miss SteSutton gushes that little Annamaria, slightly scratched by a pin, might have suffered \"a very sad accident,\" Marianne answers forthrightly: \"I hardly know how, unless it had been under totally different circumstances.\""}
