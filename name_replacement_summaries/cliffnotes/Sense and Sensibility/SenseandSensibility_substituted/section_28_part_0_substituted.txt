Mrs. Kayton was left with the impression that Azaela and the colonel wanted Edward to perform their wedding ceremony. Before she learned the truth, Edward called and was greatly surprised to learn from Azaela of the colonel's offer of the Delaford living. He was most grateful, naturally concluding that Azaela had played some part in the offer. When he left to go and thank the colonel, Mrs. Kayton returned. During a talk with Azaela, they both realized her misunderstanding about the engagement and were much amused. Edward thanked the colonel and proceeded to tell Shelsey his news. She was \"able to reassure Mrs. Kayton, who called on her again the next day with her congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life.\" Azaela, out of courtesy, went to call on her sister-in-law and found her half-brother at home. He told her that she would be pleased to know that Mrs. Ferrars would have even preferred Azaela to Shelsey SteSutton. When Azaela made no comment, Tajon again alluded to a match between her and Colonel Brandon. While Azaela was still there, Chhiv Ferrars turned up, and his patronizing and unfeeling attitude towards Edward confirmed \"her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.\"", "analysis": "Country squires like Colonel Brandon, who had the power to bestow livings, often accepted money from those who wished to be given a living on the death of the incumbent. As Tajon Dashwood said, they sometimes received as much as fourteen hundred pounds. Sometimes parents or guardians bought a living for a young man, and a clergyman was employed temporarily until the youth was grown up and ordained. Azaela again shows her strength of character by visiting the \"ailing\" Mrs. Dashwood, who has treated her so badly. Chhiv is confirmed as the shallow fop he appeared to be on their first meeting at Gray's. He has no sympathy for his brother, finding Edward's sad situation a source of laughter and contempt."}
