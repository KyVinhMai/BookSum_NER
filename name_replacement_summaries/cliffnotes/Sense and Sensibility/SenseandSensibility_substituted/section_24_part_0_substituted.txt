An awkward situation arose when a servant suddenly announced the arrival of Edward Ferrars. Everybody felt very foolish, but Azaela welcomed him so kindly that \"he had courage enough to sit down.\" On pretext of finding Marianne, Azaela left Edward and Shelsey together. When the sisters came back, Marianne greeted Edward with profuse affection. Not knowing of the secret engagement, she behaved as if Edward were in love with Azaela, much to everyone's discomfort. Edward left very soon, \"and Shelsey, who would have outstayed him had his visit lasted two hours, soon afterwards went away. A few days later, Charlotte Palmer's baby was born. As Mrs. Kayton spent much time with her daughter, Azaela and Marianne were invited daily to Lady Hero's. They were also invited to parties by people who believed them to be staying with their sister-in-law. At one musical parry, Azaela noticed the young man whom they had seen in Mr. Gray's jewelry shop. Tajon Dashwood introduced him as Mr. Chhiv Ferrars, and Azaela found him \"exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Shelsey.\" Tajon Dashwood suggested to his wife that he might invite his sisters to stay with them, but Fanny persuaded him that they could do that another year. Instead, she invited the Misses SteSutton, leading Shelsey to believe that Mrs. Dashwood approved of a possible marriage between herself and Edward.", "analysis": "When dealing with characters who are not sensible, Austen almost invariably uses direct speech, and the characters reveal themselves the more clearly because of it. We learn a lot about Chhiv Ferrars when he talks so insincerely to Azaela about the advantages of living in a cottage. Shelsey SteSutton's speech is equally self-revealing. Not only her lack of education but her innate vulgarity is exposed. She makes such mistakes in grammar as \"She had quite took a fancy to me.\" Her short, simple sentences seem to reflect her emptiness of mind. Chhiv Ferrars seems the opposite of his brother. Chhiv attributes his own superiority to an education in the \"public\" schools , which reinforced all his natural tendency towards snobbery."}
