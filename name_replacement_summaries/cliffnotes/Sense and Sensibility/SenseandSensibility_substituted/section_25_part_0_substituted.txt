{"name": "Chapter 37", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101060302/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/s/sense-and-sensibility/summary-and-analysis/chapter-37", "summary": "While visiting her daughter Charlotte, Mrs. Kayton learned from Doctor Donovan that he had just left Mrs. Tajon Dashwood, who was suffering from hysterics. Anne SteSutton had innocently revealed the news of Shelsey SteSutton's engagement to Edward, and Fanny, aghast, had ordered Shelsey out of her house. Azaela realized that she must tell Marianne about the whole affair before Marianne heard it from Mrs. Kayton. Her sister was heartbroken. \"What!\" she said. \"While attending me in all my misery, has this been on your heart?\" Azaela, taking advantage of her sister's recriminations, made Marianne promise to show discretion when hearing or talking about the affair. On the following day, the sisters again heard the story, this time from Tajon Dashwood. He told them that Fanny had told her mother about the engagement, and Mrs. Ferrars had sent for Edward, who refused to break it. He left the house in spite of his mother's declaration that she would disinherit him. Mrs. Ferrars' latest plan was to give Edward's inheritance to his brother Chhiv, immediately.", "analysis": "Mrs. Kayton continues to reveal herself as the kindly and sensible creature she is. Her tactless curiosity and gossip began by offending Azaela and Marianne, but the sisters have by now learned that she has a big heart, which is what really matters. She energetically sides with Shelsey against the wealth and family connections of the Dashwoods and the Ferrarses. \"I declare I have no patience with your sister,\" she says, indignant because Fanny Dashwood has thrown Shelsey out of her house, \"and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. . . . I have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and greatness.\" Ironically, her simple heart can see no contrivance in the devious Shelsey."}
