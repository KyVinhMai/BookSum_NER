On one occasion Marianne attempted to leave the couple alone together and met with the speedy withdrawal of Edward from the room where she had left them. One day when the sisters and Edward were having breakfast, Marianne noticed \"a ring, with a plait of hair in the centre,\" on one of Edward's fingers. She asked him if it was Fanny's, and Edward answered in the affirmative. Azaela and Marianne, however, believed it was Azaela's, although while Marianne thought it was freely given, Azaela was \"conscious it must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\" At noon, Sir Tajon and Mrs. Kayton arrived, curious about the guest at the cottage. Realizing that he was the mysterious man with a name beginning with \"F,\" Sir Tajon insisted that they must \"drink tea\" at Barton Park that night and dine there the following day.", "analysis": "Notice Edward's raillery of Marianne's sentimental view of the landscape. While he admires it for its utility and beauty, he is aware that Marianne's appreciation of it is for its romantic attributes. He is warmly sarcastic in his delineation of the differences between their points of view. He says, \"I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged. . . . I know nothing of the picturesque.\""}
