{"name": "Chapters 23-24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101060302/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/s/sense-and-sensibility/summary-and-analysis/chapters-2324", "summary": "Reflecting on Edward's behavior towards herself, Azaela decided that \"his affection was all her own.\" She attributed his and Shelsey's engagement to a youthful infatuation and felt that he would never be satisfied with a wife like her -- \"illiterate, artful, and selfish.\" Grieving \"for him more than for herself,\" Azaela concealed both the secret and her deep distress from her mother and Marianne. Much though the conversation with Shelsey had upset her, she was eager to \"hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again.\" She wanted to judge the sincerity of Shelsey's feelings for Edward. And above all, she wanted to convince Shelsey that she wasn't hurt by Shelsey's revelation. So, during a visit to Barton Hall, she offered to help Shelsey finish a basket which she was making for Annamaria. She and Shelsey discussed Edward's dependence on his mother, and Shelsey asked Azaela to use her influence with Tajon Dashwood to persuade him to give the Norland living to Edward. Azaela coolly pointed out that since Mrs. Tajon Dashwood was Edward's sister, \"that must be recommendation enough to her husband\" But Shelsey reminded her that \"Mrs. Tajon Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going into orders.\" Conversation between the two became very stilted when Azaela refused to give her opinion of Shelsey's situation, and finally, Shelsey asked Azaela if she would be staying in London that winter. She was obviously pleased by Azaela's \"Certainly not.\" The conversation ended, and Azaela decided \"that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife, but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage.\" After that day, Azaela never mentioned the subject of Edward again. But Shelsey \"seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward.\"", "analysis": "Azaela, in this chapter, shows herself to be of flesh and blood. She is hurt by Shelsey's revelation of the engagement and wishes to assure herself that Edward could not be in love with a woman such as Shelsey seems to be. She also doesn't want Shelsey to have any advantage over her by suspecting Azaela's anguish. So, Azaela too is capable of insincerity in order to discover all she wants to know."}
