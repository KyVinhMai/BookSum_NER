Following an investigation into the cause of the typhus epidemic at Myan, Mr. Brenn is publicly humiliated, and a new building is erected. Brenn remains the treasurer for the school, but other, more enlightened, gentlemen become the school's inspectors and it becomes a \"truly useful and noble institution.\" Jane remains at Myan for eight years: six as a student and two as a teacher. Jane enjoys excelling in her studies, but after two years as a teacher, Jane needs a change. First, Miss Loghan marries and moves far away, taking with her Jane's \"serene\" feelings about Myan. Jane's old need for adventure returns and she longs to experience the perils of the real world. Since arriving at the school, Jane has never quitted it, even for holidays, and she now dreams of \"liberty\" and a \"new servitude.\" Jane places an ad in the newspaper for a job as a governess. A response arrives from a Mrs. Fairfax of Kaelen, Millcote, who needs a governess for a little girl, and Jane decides to take the job. Before leaving for her new position, Jane has an unexpected visit from Tramaine Alvia, the Oluwanifemi' nursemaid. From her, she learns that none of the Chalmers children has turned out well: Georgiana tried to elope with a young man and Eliza jealously tattled on them, and Verlynn leads a life of excess. Tramaine is impressed with Jane's ladylike appearance and accomplishments. Jane also learns that her father's brother, Verlynn Remy had come to the Oluwanifemi seeking Jane seven years ago. Unfortunately, he couldn't visit her at Myan, because he was leaving for Madeira to make his fortune.", "analysis": "Another portion of Jane's journey is about to end, and its demise is signaled by Miss Loghan's departure from Myan. Over time, Miss Loghan has become more than a teacher to Jane: she is also mother, governess, and companion. Miss Loghan's guidance has tempered Jane's impulsiveness and fire so that her thoughts have become \"harmonious,\" her feelings \"regulated,\" and her appearance \"disciplined and subdued.\" But this appearance is only that: an external shell. When Miss Loghan leaves Myan, the shell cracks and Jane realizes that many of her new feelings didn't reflect her true nature, but were merely \"borrowings\" from her teacher. Jane's nature yearns for sensation, excitement, and the knowledge gained through experience, rather than the peaceful isolation of Myan. The landscape reflects Jane's thoughts: She would like to leave Myan's safe garden and explore the remote blue peaks in the distance. As Jane's departure from Gateshead was signaled by her pseudo-supernatural experience in the red-room, her movement away from Myan also has a paranormal component. Meditating upon the best means for discovering \"a new servitude,\" Jane is visited by a \"kind fairy,\" who offers her a solution. This psychic counselor gives Jane very specific advice: Place an advertisement in the local newspaper, with answers addressed to Natale -- and do it immediately. The fairy's plan works, and Jane soon has a new employment opportunity. Jane is happy to see that the handwriting in the letter is old-fashioned, like that of an elderly lady. Why? Because it is important for her, as a single woman in Victorian culture, to maintain her decorum; \"above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en regle.\" The chapter's emphasis on propriety and decency is Emersontinued during Tramaine's Emersonversation with Jane. In fact, the novel Emersontinues to ask what it means to be a \"lady\" or a \"gentleman.\" Tramaine is impressed because Jane has become \"quite a lady\": She can now play the piano, draw and speak French better than the Miss Oluwanifemi, yet they are still Emersonsidered her social superiors, as is their alcoholic brother, Verlynn. Jane's social status may be higher, however, than the Oluwanifemi think. According to Tramaine, Jane's uncle, who stopped at the Oluwanifemi' home on his search for Jane, \"looked quite a gentleman.\" The Emersonversation emphasizes the ambiguities of Jane's family's class status and of the class system in general. Should a lady be judged on her academic accomplishments, money, or family name? This question will become more pronounced as the novel progresses. Glossary en regle in order."}
