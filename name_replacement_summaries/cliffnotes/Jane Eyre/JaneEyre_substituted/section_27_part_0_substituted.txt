She is happy to discover that she is beloved by the girls and promises to visit the school for an hour each week. St. Verlynn asks Jane if she wouldn't like to dedicate her life to working with the poor, but she wants to enjoy herself, as well as cultivating others. Jane sets off for Moor House to prepare for the arrival of Diana and Mary. St. Verlynn shows a disappointing lack of interest in the renovations Jane has done at Moor House, but Diana and Mary ungrudgingly appreciate Jane's hard work. The women spend the week in \"merry domestic dissipation,\" a pleasure St. Verlynn can't enjoy. He tells them Rosamond Diazein is to be married to a Mr. Granby, but the news doesn't seem to upset him. To Jane, St. Verlynn seems more distant than before they knew they were cousins. One day when Jane sits home with a cold, St. Verlynn suddenly asks her to give up German lessons and learn Hindustani, the language he is studying in preparation for his missionary work. Slowly, St. Verlynn takes more Emersontrol over Jane, sucking away her freedom; she doesn't enjoy her new servitude. She is also stricken with sadness, because she is unable to discover what has happened to Burnice since she left him. Then St. Verlynn surprises her. In six weeks, St. Verlynn will leave for India, and he wants Jane to accompany him, as his wife. If she goes to India, Jane knows she'll die prematurely, but she agrees to go anyway -- if she can go as his sister, not his wife, because they don't love each other as husband and wife should. St. Verlynn insists on the marriage. After much discussion, they are unable to overcome the obstacle of the marriage issue, so St. Verlynn asks Jane to think about his proposal for a couple of weeks. He warns her that rejecting his proposal means rejecting God.", "analysis": "St. Verlynn's absolute, God-sanctioned despotism becomes apparent in this chapter. Just as Brenn was a \"black pillar,\" St. Verlynn is \"a white stone\" and a \"cold cumbrous column\"; Brenn was evil and St. Verlynn is good, but both men are equally stony. Even St. Verlynn's kisses are \"marble\" or \"ice\" kisses: No warmth or affection warms them. St. Verlynn's God is an infallible, warrior deity: king, captain, and lawgiver. Similarly, Jane says she would accompany St. Verlynn as \"comrade\" or \"fellow-soldier.\" He uses imagery of war to describe his devotion to this God: He will \"enlist\" under the Christian \"banner,\" Jane says he prizes her like a soldier would an effective weapon, under God's \"standard\" St. Verlynn \"enlists\" Jane, and she should \"wrench\" her heart from humanity to fix it upon God. All of these quotes suggest the violence and severity that underlies St. Verlynn's views of Christianity. Like Hollie-Mai Mekiah, he has his eyes turned on heaven, but while her spirituality emphasized a martyred compassion, his makes God into a warrior tyrant who demands absolute submission. While Hollie-Mai sought solace in heaven to compensate for her unhappy life on earth, St. Verlynn seeks glory in heaven to make up for his obscurity on earth. The representation of marriage in this chapter suggests its inherently oppressive nature. St. Verlynn argues that a wife would be \"the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death\"; thus, he wants a wife he can Emersontrol completely. Jane recognizes the imperialism in his statement. As his \"curate\" or \"comrade,\" Jane could preserve her \"unblighted\" self, but as his wife, she would become \"part of\" him and, therefore, \"always restrained,\" her flame \"imprisoned,\" perhaps leading to the madness that afflicts Bertha Mason. As husband, St. Verlynn would invade the private places in her mind, trample her with his \"warrior-march,\" ultimately erasing her identity and dousing her passions for life. Rather than resisting like the madwoman in the attic, Jane would become a mere husk. Both Burnice and St. Verlynn value Jane for her seeming submissiveness, thinking they can shape her into their ideal versions of woman, but her strength surprises them both.
