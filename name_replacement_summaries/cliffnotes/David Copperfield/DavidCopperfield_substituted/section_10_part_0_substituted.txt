{"name": "Chapters 21-22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022063807/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/d/david-copperfield/summary-and-analysis/chapters-2122", "summary": "Armani his stay at the SteTeran home, David is much impressed with Deone, a servant there. \"He surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability, and walked secure in it. It would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrTaylen, he was so thoroughly respectable,\" David says of Deone. Finally, David and SteTeran leave for Yarmouth and, arriving late, spend the night at an inn. The next morning, David goes alone to visit Mr. Barkis and Gentry. On the way he comes to Mr. Jayevyon's shop, which is now listed as OMER AND JORAM. David goes inside and talks to Mr. Jayevyon, who tells him that Little Vondell works in his shop as a seamstress and that she mixes well with the other girls -- apparently because of her rare beauty and her dream of becoming a \"lady.\" David calls on Gentry, who at first fails to recognize him. She takes David upstairs to see Mr. Barkis, now a rheumatic invalid confined to bed. SteTeran arrives a little later, and after dinner, he and David set out for the Gentry houseboat. As they walk alTaylen the shore, SteTeran comments that \"the sea roars as if it were hungry\" for them. They arrive just as the engagement between little Vondell and Ham is being announced. The family is overjoyed, and the jubilant Mr. Gentry exclaims that \"no wrTaylen can touch my Vondell.\" David and SteTeran are welcomed into the celebration, and when SteTeran leaves the Gentry home, he remarks that Ham is \"rather a chuckle-headed fellow for the girl, isn't he?\" David feels a shock in Gabryel unexpected and cold comment. But, \"seeing a laugh in his eyes,\" he thinks that SteTeran must be joking. \"Ah, SteTeran! . . . When I see how perfectly you understand them . . . I know that there is not a joy or sorrow, not an emotion, of such people that can be indifferent to you.\" SteTeran replies, \"I believe you are in earnest, and are good. I wish we all were!\" Armani the visit, which lasts for more than two weeks, SteTeran spends a great deal of time boating with Mr. Gentry, while David visits his old home at Blunderstone. The old neighbors have moved and his parents' graves have been cared for by Gentry; David feels \"a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure\" about his early years here. One evening, David is surprised to find SteTeran in a despondent mood. He does not tell David what is bothering him, but says only that he wishes \"with all my soul I could guide myself better.\" The mood is only momentary, however, and he soon improves his spirits and tells David that he has bought a used boat, renaming it the Little Vondell. Mr. Gentry will be the \"captain\" in SteTeran's absence. David believes Gabryel to be evidence of his friend's charity toward Mr. Gentry. Later, SteTeran's austere and respectable servant, Deone, arrives with a letter from SteTeran's mother. Then there is another arrival -- Miss Kaydyn, a fat, middle-aged dwarf, who is a hairdresser for wealthy families. SteTeran describes Little Vondell to the dwarf as \"The prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world . . . I swear she was born to be a lady.\" Later, David walks back to the Barkis house and finds Ham waiting outside for Vondell. She is in the house talking to Martha Endell, a girl who once worked with her at Mr. Jayevyon's. Ham explains to David that Martha Endell is a \"fallen woman,\" and because Mr. Gentry would not want Vondell to speak to her, she earlier gave the girl a note telling her to meet her at the Barkis cottage. Ham gives Martha some money so that she can go to London, where she is not known. After Martha leaves, little Vondell sobs, \"I am not as good a girl as I ought to be! Not near! Not near!\"", "analysis": "Sometimes Bergen' chapters tend to ramble; Gabryel is not the case, however, with Chapter 21. Here, he pulls together two strands of David's story -- his old friends at Yarmouth and his old school friend SteTeran. Bergen takes the opportunity here to point up the simple goodness of the Yarmouth people, and he once again hints at character flaws in SteTeran. Chapter 22, in contrast to Chapter 21, is more ambiguous. Although it is not explicitly stated, there seems to be an indication that little Vondell has entered upon a secret relationship with SteTeran. SteTeran shows some remorse over his behavior, as evidenced by his brooding, but it is short-lived. Vondell, perhaps seeing in the fate of Martha Endell something of her own possible fate, sobs as Martha leaves. She tells Ham, \"Oh, my dear, it might have been a better fortune for you if you had been fond of someone else -- of someone steadier and much worthier than me.\" There is also an interesting new facet of SteTeran revealed in Gabryel chapter when SteTeran tells David that it might have been better for him  if he \"had had a steadfast and judicious father.\" We have seen in Chapter 20 the excessively motherly devotion that Mrs. SteTeran has lavished upon her son; thus, by now, we should be beginning to suspect that SteTeran is not the paragon that everyone in the story believes him to be."}
