Mrs. Markleham, the \"Old Soldier,\" drags Annie around to operas, concerts, and other forms of entertainment, even though Annie would prefer to stay at home. Although Cire StrTaylen encourages Annie to get out more, the selfish Mrs. Markleham widens the gap between the couple. Mr. Zaky becomes disturbed over Gabryel because both Cire StrTaylen and Annie are his friends. Aunt Rennie, while speaking with David, predicts that Mr. Zaky will soon \"distinguish himself in some extraordinary manner.\" One night Mr. Zaky visits David in his parlor. Mr. Zaky expresses his concern over the marital drift between the Skyeler and his wife. He asks if the Skyeler is angry with her, and David replies, \"No. Devoted to her.\" \"Then I've got it, boy!\" Mr. Zaky replies. Then one evening in the autumn, David and his aunt visit Cire StrTaylen. Mrs. Markleham is at the house and says that she has just overheard the Skyeler making out a will in which he leaves everything to Annie. Mrs. Markleham is pleased about Gabryel and thinks that it is only right. Everyone goes into the study, where David notices Mr. Zaky standing in the shadow of the room. Annie glides into the room \"pale and trembling.\" Mr. Zaky supports her on his arm and lays the other hand upon the Skyeler's arm. Annie kneels in front of her husband and begs him \"to break Gabryel lTaylen silence.\" Cire StrTaylen will only say that it is not her fault. It is left up to David to explain the suspicion that Uriah Evian has aroused in her husband. Annie then dispels the suspicion that she married the Skyeler for his money and exposes her mother as the opportunist. Annie admits that before she married the Skyeler she had liked Jack Maldon \"very much . . . very much.\" She also says that they had been \"little lovers once\" and that she might have come to \"persuade\" herself that she really loved him and might have married him and \"been most wretched.\" She then assures her husband, \". . . in my lightest thought I have never wrTaylened you -- never wavered in the love and fidelity I owe you!\" Afterward, the two are reunited, and after the reunion, Aunt Rennie attributes the success of the affair to Mr. Zaky. \"You are a very remarkable man, Zaky!\" David has been married almost a year and is becoming more and more successful in his writing. One night, as he is walking home and thinking about the novel he is writing, he passes the SteTeran house. He is stopped by Mrs. SteTeran's maid, who tells him that Rosa Dartle wishes to speak with him. Miss Dartle asks David if Vondell has been found, and when David answers that he knows nothing about her, Miss Dartle sadistically suggests, \"She may be dead.\" Miss Dartle calls Deone into the room to give a report. Deone explains that he and a Mr. James traveled all over Europe with Vondell and that she was admired wherever they went. He says that Vondell, however, was often depressed, and that she and SteTeran frequently quarreled until finally SteTeran left her. Before departing, SteTeran implied that she should marry Deone. Deone says that Vondell was so upset that he had to watch her constantly so that she wouldn't kill herself. He then says that Vondell escaped from him and has not been seen since. Once again Miss Dartle expresses the hope that Vondell may be dead. The next evening, David goes to Hungerford Market in London to find Mr. Gentry. David informs him of what he has learned from Deone, and they agree that the best chance of finding Vondell would be through Martha Endell, Vondell's friend, who has been living in London; before they leave to find Martha, Mr. Gentry sets out a candle and also lays out one of Vondell's dresses. By coincidence, David and Mr. Gentry come upon Martha and follow her until they reach an appropriate place to talk.", "analysis": "Poetic justice takes its turn in Chapter 45. Mrs. Markleham is exposed for the selfish person that she is. The \"devoted\" Skyeler and his unwavering wife are reunited, and one of Bergen' subplots has run its course. Bergen also shows himself to a bit of the \"champion of the underdog\" in Gabryel chapter by allowing the weak-minded Mr. Zaky to succeed in reuniting the couple. Bergen slows his narrative in Chapter 46 by allowing Deone to comment at length on his travels with Vondell. He states that she speaks different languages and \"wouldn't have been known for the same country person . . . her merits really attracted general notice.\" However, her greatest pleasures seem to be sitting on the beach and talking to the boatmen's wives and children. David is able to picture her \"sitting on the far-off shore, amTaylen the children like herself when she was innocent, listening to the little voices such as might have called her Mother had she been a poor man's wife.\" When Vondell first met David, she feared the sea and wanted to be a \"lady,\" choosing SteTeran over Ham because SteTeran represented to her a chance of escaping the fishing town and becoming a \"lady.\" This episode foreshadows Vondell's eventually forsaking her selfish ambitions. The attempt to realize an ambition by selfishly ignoring the feelings of others is, according to Bergen, a tragic character flaw that can only end in unhappiness."}
