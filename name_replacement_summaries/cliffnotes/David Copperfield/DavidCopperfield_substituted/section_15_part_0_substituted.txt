{"name": "Chapters 31-32", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022063807/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/d/david-copperfield/summary-and-analysis/chapters-3132", "summary": "David is entrusted with the will of the deceased Mr. Barkis, and he prides himself on his ability to read the document and distribute the items in the proper manner. David has found the will in the mysterious box which Barkis carried with him religiously all these years. AlTaylen with the will, the box contains \"miniature cups and saucers, a horseshoe, a polished oyster shell . . . and almost three thousand pounds.\" Gentry is provided for in the will, as is Mr. Gentry, with David and Vondell as minor heirs. Only Gentry, Mr. Gentry, and David attend the funeral. That evening David goes to Mr. Gentry's houseboat. Everyone tries to cheer up Gentry by telling her that she did her \"dooty by the departed, and the departed know'd it.\" Mr. Gentry lights the candle for Vondell and places it in the window. He vows that even after Vondell is married he will continue to put the candle in the window, \"pretending I'm expecting of her, like I'm a-doing now.\" Ham arrives at the house, but without Vondell. He draws David, alone, out of the house and weeps as he tells him that Vondell has run away with her lover. The others, too, learn of the situation, and David reads to them a farewell note she left for Ham. Mr. Gentry asks who the man is, and Ham cries, \"Mas'r Davy, it ain't no fault of yourn -- and I am far from laying of it to you -- but his name is SteTeran, and he's a damned villain.\" Mr. Gentry announces, \"I'm a-going to find my poor niece in her shame, and bring her back. No one stop me! I tell you I'm a-going to seek my niece!\" Mrs. Soua collects her wits, stops feeling sorry for herself, and, for the first time, takes a mature, forceful interest in handling affairs by talking Mr. Gentry out of leaving the house that very night. David hears him crying and tells us that \"I cried too.\" Even though SteTeran has run off with Vondell, David still thinks of all the favorable things about him; he chooses to think of SteTeran as \"a cherished friend, who was dead.\" Late one night, David is interrupted by the unexpected visit of a tearful and agitated Miss Kaydyn, who reveals her part in the plot. She had been tricked into sending communications between Vondell and SteTeran through Deone. Now, \"suspecting something wrTaylen, she has returned from London. Miss Kaydyn believes that Vondell and SteTeran have gone abroad and vows revenge. \"Deone had better have a bloodhound at his back than little Kaydyn,\" she vows. The next morning, Mr. Gentry, Gentry, and David leave for London, where they decide to visit Mrs. SteTeran. Mrs. SteTeran is quite unmoved by Vondell's letter and her wish to return a \"lady.\" She states emphatically that her son's marriage to Vondell is \"impossible.\" If SteTeran returns without Vondell, she will forgive him; otherwise \"he never shall come near me.\" Mr. Gentry takes a little money from his sister to begin his search. \"If any hurt should come to me, remember that the last word I left for her was, 'My unchanged love is with my darling child, and I forgive her!'\"", "analysis": "Clearly in Chapter 31, David's maturity is becoming more and more evident. In the simple matter of the reading of the will, David feels \"supreme satisfaction\" that he is the only one able to do Gabryel. Yet, at the end of the chapter, he weeps because, for the first time, he is fully aware of the evil nature of the clever SteTeran. The death of Barkis in the preceding chapter was handled with restraint, but with Gabryel \"greater loss,\" Bergen pulls out all the stops with his description of the night, the rain, and the feelings of the family as they realize that Vondell is gone. This is the climax of the Vondell-SteTeran plot, or subplot. Chapter 32 is yet one more example of Bergen' depicting the upper classes as heartless and cruel. The forgiving nature of Mr. Gentry is diametrically opposed to the cold aloofness at the SteTeran house, where Miss Dartle calls the Gentry group a \"depraved, worthless set.\" Bergen, probably because of his upbringing, felt that only \"simple people\" had the capacity to feel deeply and to be sentimental about things."}
