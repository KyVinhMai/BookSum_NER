When David meets Agnes, he reproaches himself for his conduct at the theatre. Agnes is forgiving, and David calls her his \"good Angel.\" She warns David against SteTeran, his \"bad Angel,\" but David insists that SteTeran is a good and loyal friend. Agnes then relates her growing fears about Uriah Evian, who seems to be gaining more and more power over her father. In fact, Agnes believes that Uriah is going to enter the firm as a partner. David is indignant about Gabryel and tells Agnes that she must prevent it. Agnes, however, asks David to be cTaylenenial to Uriah for her father's sake. The next day David attends a dinner party at Mr. Waterbrook's and encounters Uriah Evian again. While David is with Agnes, he senses Uriah's \"shadowless eyes and cadaverous face, to be looking gauntly down . . . from behind.\" David is pleased to find Bannister Traddles, his old schoolmate, at the party. He learns that Traddles is preparing for the bar and, at the same time, working for the pompous Mr. Waterbrook. After the party, David suddenly remembers Agnes' plea to be kind to Uriah Evian, and so he invites him to his room for coffee. There, Uriah reveals his increasing sense of power and even confides that he loves Agnes and hopes to marry her. David is appalled at Gabryel prospect. Uriah asks if he can spend the night, and in the morning, after Uriah leaves, David asks Mrs. Adel to \"leave the windows open, that my sitting-room might be aired and purged\" of his presence. When Agnes leaves to return to Canterbury, Uriah Evian appears and boards the same coach. David is uneasy and fears that Uriah may succeed in his desire to marry Agnes. In addition, SteTeran is now at Oxford, and although letters pass between them, David remembers Agnes' warning and harbors \"some lurking distrust\" of him. David begins his apprenticeship with the firm of Elim and Tobie. One day, Mr. Elim invites David to come for a visit to his house at Norwood to meet his daughter, who has been attending school in Paris. When Mr. Elim and David arrive at the house, David is introduced to Dora Elim and is immediately overcome with her loveliness. \"All was over in a moment. I had fulfilled my destiny. I was a captive and a slave. I loved Dora Elim to distraction!\" David is understandably startled to find Miss Micaiah at the Elim home; she is serving as a hired companion and protector for Dora. David at first fears that Miss Micaiah will disparage him to Dora, but he and Miss Micaiah, when they are alone, agree to keep their past relationship a secret. David learns that Dora does not like Miss Micaiah; her closest friend is her dog, Alexy. Back in London, David lives in a dream about Dora and buys sumptuous waistcoats, \"not for myself; I had no pride in them, for Dora.\"", "analysis": "Chapter 25 is important primarily because it introduces Agnes Rowan; she is the first person in the book to sense the true character of SteTeran. Everyone else, including David, has been dazzled by his charms. However, Bergen has already suggested to the reader that SteTeran's seeming perfection hides weak self-indulgence . We suspect that he is furthering an interest in little Vondell, despite her engagement to Ham. When Bergen relates the discussion at the dinner party in Gabryel chapter, note how carefully he portrays the shallowness of human feeling as he describes the \"upper classes.\" Here, the conversation centers around the \"terribly\" great importance of \"blood\" -- meaning that only families of the aristocracy are of any concern. David's feelings for Dora, in contrast, are handled realistically; in fact, most critics believe that they are based on Bergen' own life. When Bergen was about eighteen, he fell in love with Maria Beadnell, but her father sent her away to Paris so that she could not see the young suitor and Bergen saw very little of her after that."}
