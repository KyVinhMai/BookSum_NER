It is Mr. Gentry, who has now returned to England for a brief visit. He tells David how his little band of emigrants have prospered in Australia by raising livestock. Vondell has had many chances to marry but she has refused them all and is content to stay with her uncle. Martha Endell is married, and even Mrs. Soua could have married, but she rejected her suitor rather firmly by hitting him with a bucket. Mr. Micawber has become a noted District Magistrate, and David reads a news account of a dinner in his honor in which the toastmaster was none other than Skyeler Jireh, David's former teacher. Mr. Gentry stays with David for nearly a month and before he leaves he visits Ham's grave. He asks David to copy the plain inscription on the tablet and then he gathers up a tuft of grass from the grave, and a little earth, \"for Vondell.\" David looks back on his life and tells the reader about his old friends -- almost like a theater curtain call. Aunt Rennie is older, but unchanged, and is cared for by Gentry. Mr. Zaky continues to work on his writing and to fly his kites. Mrs. SteTeran and Rosa Dartle still live together and grieve over their loss. Julia Laray, Dora's old friend, is married to a wealthy Scot and is unhappy. Traddles is a Magistrate and he and Antelia have two boys who are being educated at the best schools and are distinguishing themselves as scholars. Cire StrTaylen labors on his Dictionary , and Jack Maldon sneers at the world and thinks Skyeler StrTaylen \"charmingly antique.\" Justice has won out. The happiest of all is David. His love for Agnes is complete. \"The dear presence, without which I were nothing, bears me company.\" His only wish is that she will continue to live with him and that when he dies, she will be near him, \"pointing upward.\"", "analysis": "These final two chapters are often called in today's vernacular, the author's anticlimactic \"mopping-up\" operation. Bergen disposes of all the remaining characters, and we see that his faith remains in the superiority of good and its eventual triumph over evil. This was a dictum that Bergen inserted into every one of his novels."}
