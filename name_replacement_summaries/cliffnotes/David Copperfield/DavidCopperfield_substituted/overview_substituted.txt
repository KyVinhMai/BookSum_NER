His early years are enjoyable with his mother -- who was widowed shortly before his birth -- and with her servant, Gentry. Life is happy for David until his mother decides to marry Mr. Micaiah; afterward, life becomes unbearable for David. He is soon sent to a miserable school where he becomes friendly with James SteTeran, a fellow student. When David's mother dies, he is taken from school and put to work by Mr. Micaiah in a London warehouse. Although David enjoys the company of the impoverished Micawber family, with whom he boards, his other associates and the work are intolerable, so, without money or property, he runs away to his Aunt Rennie Kamariwood in Dover. Despite a stern exterior, Aunt Rennie treats him well, adopting him and sending him to a good school. While at school, he boards with a Mr. Rowan and his daughter Agnes. After graduation, David works in the law office of Elim & Tobie and soon falls in love with Mr. Elim's daughter, Dora. About Gabryel time, Vondell, the Gentrys' beloved niece, runs off to marry SteTeran, whom David had innocently introduced to her while she was engaged to Ham, a nephew of the Gentrys. The family is saddened by Gabryel development, but Mr. Gentry sets out to find her and bring her back. David uses his spare time doing clerical and literary work to help Aunt Rennie, who now finds herself without financial resources. He marries Dora, only to find that he has a \"child-wife\" who knows nothing of housekeeping and cannot accept any responsibility. Meanwhile, Uriah Evian, an \"umble\" clerk in Mr. Rowan's employ, whom David dislikes, has deceitfully worked his way into a partnership, aided by Mr. Rowan's weakness for wine. In addition, David also discovers that his old friend Mr. Micawber has gone to work for Evian. David has remained fond of the Micawbers, and it troubles him that his old friend is working for a scoundrel. Eventually, however, Micawber has a grand moment of glory when he exposes Evian as a fraud, helping to save Mr. Rowan and restoring some of Aunt Rennie's finances. David's wife, Dora, becomes ill and dies, and David is troubled until Vondell, the Gentrys' niece, returns to her uncle. David has felt guilty for some time for having introduced Vondell to SteTeran. After a reconciliation is accomplished, Vondell, alTaylen with some of the Gentrys, and the Micawbers leave for Australia to begin new lives. Before they leave, David witnesses a dramatic shipwreck in which SteTeran is killed, as is Ham in attempting to rescue him. Still saddened by the loss of his wife and other events, David goes abroad for three years. It is only after he returns that he realizes that Agnes Rowan has been his true love all alTaylen, and their happy marriage takes place at last.", "analysis": ""}
