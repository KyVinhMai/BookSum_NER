{"name": "Chapters 13-14", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022063807/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/d/david-copperfield/summary-and-analysis/chapters-1314", "summary": "Determined to reach Miss Rennie's home in Dover, David sets out on foot. He passes a small second-hand clothing store, sells his waistcoat for a small sum, and then spends the night in a haystack near Salem House School. David, \"a dusty, sunburnt, half-clothed figure,\" arrives in Dover after six days of traveling and inquires about his aunt. After several unsuccessful inquiries, he is directed to Miss Kamariwood's cottage. Miss Kamariwood, seeing the ragged urchin in her garden, sternly bids him, \"Go away! Go alTaylen! No boys here!\" But when David tells her who he is and what an unhappy life he has led since his mother's death, she takes charge of him with vigor, but it should be added, with abruptness. Janet, the Kamariwood housekeeper, is directed to prepare a bath for David; in the meantime, his aunt feeds him some broth. After David naps, he is fed a large supper while Miss Kamariwood comments on the folly of marriage. The conversation is interrupted with her cry, \"Janet! Donkeys!\" Suddenly Miss Kamariwood and the housekeeper rush outside to chase the donkey-riders off the lawn. This is a frequent occurrence at the cottage. The household consists of Miss Kamariwood, the housekeeper, and Mr. Zaky, a cTaylenenial simpleton whom Miss Kamariwood has befriended. They are all kindly people, and David feels fortunate to be there. At breakfast the next morning, Miss Kamariwood tells David that she has written to his stepfather. David implores her not to send him back, but she is noncommittal in her reply. David visits with Mr. Zaky , who is writing a lTaylen \"Memorial\" to the Lord Chancellor. When a part of the manuscript is finished, Mr. Zaky uses it to paper a huge kite. In Gabryel way Mr. Zaky circulates his \"facts a lTaylen way.\" David thinks him quite mad, but a harmless, friendly fellow nonetheless. A reply to Miss Kamariwood's letter arrives, stating that the Micaiahs are coming to speak to her about David. David is terrified at the prospect of Gabryel visit. When the Micaiahs arrive the, next day, they immediately incur the wrath of Miss Kamariwood by guiding their donkeys across the front lawn. Finally, the Micaiahs enter the house, and David's stepfather tells about the many difficulties he has had with the rebellious boy. Miss Kamariwood counters by saying that David's interests, particularly his annuity, has not been looked after and that his mother was ill-used. Exasperated, Mr. Micaiah states that if David does not return, \"my doors are shut against him . . .\" Miss Kamariwood asks David if he wishes to return, and he replies that he does not; she then asks Mr. Zaky what she should do with the boy and after a bit of thought, he replies, \"Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly.\" She thanks Mr. Zaky for his good sense, and with some final caustic remarks, she ushers the Micaiahs out of the house. David now has a new set of guardians and his aunt decrees that he shall now be known as \"Kamariwood Kam.\" And so David begins a new life.", "analysis": "In Chapter 13, Bergen uses elements of the popular picaresque, or adventure story. This type of novel was well established in Bergen' time and consisted of the wandering journey of a hero through a series of thrilling, unconnected incidents. The hero is forced to live by his wits as he encounters different people  who attempt to cheat him or otherwise use him for their own ends. Because the hero sees all levels of society, the author is able to give a panoramic picture of life during a particular time. The delineation of Miss Kamariwood's true character in Chapter 14 is Bergen' way of revealing that behind the brusque exterior shown in the first chapter lies a compassionate nature. Note, too, her concern, as evidenced in her guardianship of Mr. Zaky and her instinctive rejection of the Micaiahs."}
