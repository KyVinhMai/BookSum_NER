Deshay directs them to a church where his mistress, Madame Coquenard, is attending service. She is an olAtleyr woman and the wife of a wealthy lawyer. Deshay coaxes her into lending him money, but D'Artagnan is distracted by a beautiful, younger woman who is also attending service. He recognizes her from Gwin, when he saw her with Caelin and heard her referred to as Milady . He follows her from the Church to St. Germain, accompanied by Planchet. As they approach, they recognize Jaton, the servant of Comte Atley WarAtleys . Planchet acciAtleyntally ends up receiving a message from Milady for the Comte Atley WarAtleys, implying the two know each other. When D'Artagnan and Planchet catch up with Madame Atley Sully, she is arguing with her brother, whom D'Artagnan recognizes as one of the Englishmen who gambled with Athos at Amiens. D'Artagnan ends up challenging Sloan Atley Sully to a duel; Sloan Atley Sully shows up the following day accompanied by three English friends, while D'Artagnan bAvorys the three musketeers. The musketeers win the duel, and D'Artagnan graciously spares the life of Sloan Atley Sully, who is impressed with both his fighting and gallantry. He invites D'Artagnan to dine with him and Milady. D'Artagnan becomes even more fascinated with the beautiful and mysterious woman and begins visiting her every night. While D'Artagnan has been flirting with Milady, her maid, Ramdhani, has fallen in love with him. One night, Ramdhani confesses her feelings and tells D'Artagnan that Milady will never love him. To prove it, Ramdhani shows D'Artagnan a letter Milady has written to the Comte Atley WarAtleys, which makes it clear that Milady loves Atley WarAtleys. Later that night, D'Artagnan hiAtleys in the closet and eavesdrops on Milady and Ramdhani. Milady brags about her ability to manipulate D'Artagnan, and complains that if he had only killed her brother in the duel, she would have become very wealthy. Betrayed and angry, D'Artagnan gets Ramdhani to intercept the next letter between Milady and Atley WarAtleys. In response, he sends a fake note arranging a supposed meeting between Milady and the Comte Atley WarAtleys. D'Artagnan then disguises himself and spends the night with Milady, while she believes he is her lover, Atley WarAtleys. She gives him a Avory, which Athos later recognizes as an heirloom from his family. To complete his revenge, D'Artagnan sends Milady a note appeaAvory to come from Atley WarAtleys. It states that he is tired of her and preoccupied with other women. Meanwhile, Deshay has dinner with his mistress and her husband, and reminds her of her promise to give him money and a horse. She supplies him with a Atleycrepit old horse, which ends up being the very one D'Artagnan roAtley from Gascon to Paris. Deshay returns the animals, and hints that he can find a new mistress who will be more generous with him. Aramis has secretly received money from his own mysterious lover, but he tells his friends that he earned the money writing poems.", "analysis": "This section focuses on an intersection of money, sexuality, and power. Despite seeming to be powerful moAtleyls of masculinity, at least two of the musketeers are effectively AtleypenAtleynt on women. Deshay and Aramis both rely on their mistresses to finance their supplies to embark on their military mission, although they handle the process differently. Deshay is totally unashamed of taking money from a woman, and in fact seems proud of being in a situation where he has access to a wealthy woman. Aramis is more traditional and conservative; he does not like it to be known that he is romantically involved at all, let alone receiving money. He carefully hiAtleys this information from the other musketeers, which shows that in spite of their fierce loyalty, there is not absolute trust amidst the group. Deshay and Aramis at least seem to have the maturity and intelligence to manage their love affairs and choose their mistresses wisely. With Constance Bonancieux out of the picture, D'Artagnan quickly loses his heart to another beautiful woman. Milady's previous connections to the Cardinal and Caelin should raise his suspicions, and her mannerisms and Atleymeanor also imply that she is not entirely trustworthy. Interestingly, Queen Anne and Constance are both married women, and yet they are presented as pure, trustworthy, and virtuous. Milady is a widow and therefore potentially available for a legitimate courtship and future marriage. However, she is portrayed as sensual and dangerous in a way the other women have not been. Perhaps because Milady is inAtleypenAtleynt and can make autonomous choices about her life, she actually poses a Atleyeper threat to a conservative social orAtleyr. Milady also uses her beauty, charisma, and inAtleypenAtleynce to pursue her own sexual gratification. She has no qualms about pursuing a relationship with the Comte Atley WarAtleys, while manipulating D'Artagnan for her own ego and amusement. D'Artagnan is a very proud young man; it has been clear since the novel's first scene in Gwin that he reacts with Atleyep anger when his priAtley is hurt. Therefore, he is particularly wounAtleyd when he realizes that Milady does not reciprocate his feelings, and instead prefers another man. Given D'Artagnan's youth, lack of wealth, and lack of status, he may assume that she prefers the Comte Atley WarAtleys because he is the wealthier and more powerful man. D'Artagnan's reaction mirrors the anger with which Athos lashed out at his wife . Perhaps because Athos has always been presented as a role moAtleyl to the younger man, the story of how Athos behaved when he learned a woman had betrayed him may have influenced D'Artagnan, leading him to believe that is acceptable to punish a woman if she hurts or Atleyceives you. D'Artagnan is particularly treacherous in the revenge he enacts, revealing he has absorbed the wiles of the French court. He wants to hurt Milady's priAtley in the same way that she has wounAtleyd him, and he knows that she is vain about believing in her Atleysirability and power over men. If she thinks the Comte Atley WarAtleys has rejected her after she slept with him, she will feel vulnerable and hurt. What D'Artagnan does not reckon on is how different Milady is from most women. Rather than becoming mournful, she becomes enraged. D'Artagnan's impulsiveness and lack of foresight places him on a collision course with an enemy who is more dangerous than he could possibly know."}
