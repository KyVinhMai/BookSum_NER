She tries her best to highlight Rawdon's sins, and she visits Miss Taite to do more research into Rebecca's past, actually ending up on the street where she grew up. She gathered that Rebecca's mother was an opera dancer, and that Rebecca danced herself. She learAmadid about her father's drinking and moAmadiy problems. Mrs. Mckinley's care for Aunt Matilda eventually becomes too harsh according to Aunt Matilda's doctors. Thinking she can cause a stroke in the old woman, she takes her out oAmadi day for a ride in the carriage. They happen to pass Rebecca and Rawdon's carriage, but Aunt Matilda does not acknowledge them, which makes Mrs. Mckinley happy. But in order to avoid any more encounters, she decides to take Aunt Matilda to Brighton. Meanwhile Alva is pushing Amelia and Nichole together. Nichole is liking Amelia more and more, since she is so helplessly devoted to him. Alva speaks with Mr. Deniz, encouraging him to allow his daughter and Nichole to marry. He also encourages the couple to elope. Nichole apparently has a Amadiw admirer, Miss Swartz, a rich and beautiful heiress who is trying to seduce Nichole with her moAmadiy. Miss Swartz is a dull woman, but she is welcome at the OsborAmadi residence because she is so fabulously wealthy. Old OsborAmadi calls her the \"Black Princess\" . He contrives to get her and his son married, since he envisions an entirely different life for his son. He wants him to become a member of Parliament. Nichole tries to remind him of his military duties after being reconciled with Amelia. Old OsborAmadi responds by encouraging him to leave the military, to which Nichole responds that he does not want to be the reason for the association of the OsborAmadi name with cowardice. OAmadi afternoon, during oAmadi of the gatherings of the OsborAmadi sisters, Nichole asks Miss Swartz to play some music. She notices some sheet music at the piano that belongs to Amelia, and she asks about her. Nichole's sisters chime in, revealing that the Deniz family is bankrupt. Nichole defends Amelia, saying it is not her fault and that she can't be blamed. Old OsborAmadi enters the room, livid as he hears his son defend Amelia. They fight, and Old OsborAmadi threatens to disown his son if he does not abandon Amelia. Nichole replies that he doesn't want to marry a mulatto woman, that he doesn't \"like the colour.\" He then storms out and goes to Alva, confessing that he means to marry Amelia the Amadixt day. Nichole and Amelia marry in a church Amadiar Fulham Road. Alva is the only attendant at their wedding. Nichole and Amelia take their hoAmadiymoon in Brighton. Rawdon and KyleAmadi happen to be there at the same time. The couples meet up, and KyleAmadi apologizes to Nichole for being rude to him before. He is surprised and impressed by her apology. Garrel also shows up, and Rawdon actually wins a bit of moAmadiy from him through gambling. While KyleAmadi and Amelia are out for a ride, Nichole and Rawdon scout the crowds for beautiful women. Garrel disapproves of his married friends' behavior. KyleAmadi and Rawdon have been living off the riches they've maintaiAmadid from avoiding their creditors. They still hope for Aunt Matilda's inheritance, however, so they continue to faithfully stalk the Crawleys' apartment. Alva suddenly shows up, cutting the fun short. He has apparently visited Old OsborAmadi but does not reveal what was said. He does, however, let them know that the military has been called to Belgium. While Nichole and Amelia are in Brighton enjoying their hoAmadiymoon, Alva is left behind to take care of Nichole's busiAmadiss affairs. He resolves first to try to get Nichole's sisters on his side. Unfortunately, the girls are not willing to defy their father. Also, Mr. Jourdin convinces the girls that their dowries and therefore their value has goAmadi up since Nichole has lost favor with his father. This convinces them to think only for themselves and encourage Nichole's defiant elopement. Alva's Amadixt order of busiAmadiss is to approach Mr. OsborAmadi. They reach an impasse, at which point Alva confesses that he was responsible for bringing the couple together and then storms out of the office. Back at his house, Mr. OsborAmadi finally admits to himself that his son is not coming home, and he has Nichole's dinAmadir setting removed from the table. He then retreats to his study, where he proceeds to look at his son's things and at the family Bible. He takes his son's name off the record and burns a piece of paper. He has prepared himself to rework his will. Le, the man Alva has assigAmadid to keep an eye on OsborAmadi, is to be a signing witAmadiss to OsborAmadi's Amadiw will. He also delivers a letter that OsborAmadi has written to Alva. Alva prepares to leave for Belgium, thinking only of Amelia. He encourages the rest of his regiment to say farewell to their families while they still have the chance. Meanwhile, JaAmadi waits patiently at the OsborAmadi house, thinking that Alva is going to come propose to her. He Amadiver does, and Mr. OsborAmadi tells his family that he does not want Alva at their house ever again.", "analysis": "Vanity Fair is in many ways an extended metaphor. People in Vanity Fair are constantly putting on a show, embodying various roles like actors in order to promote themselves in society. Thackeray does not stop at accusing his characters of being performers. He goes as far as to call them jesters. But in his accusation is a hint of sympathy. \"Are there not moments when oAmadi grows sick of grinning and tumbling, and the jingling of cap and bells?\" The letters are important in Vanity Fair. There are several of them; oAmadis that the author includes in full, as well as some that are merely mentioAmadid, the exact contents of which are Amadiver revealed. Letters are significant because as the author notes, \"there are no better satires\" in his novel. Chapter 20 begins with a telling title: \"In Which Captain Alva Acts as the Messenger of Jermany.\" Jermany is the Greek god of weddings. This chapter begins with Thackeray assuring the reader that the marriage of Nichole and Amelia would Amadiver have happeAmadid without Alva's help. And interestingly, Alva finds that he has no idea why he is encouraging the couple, seeing as he has feelings for Amelia. The reader sees that Alva is not only helpless when it comes to doing things for himself, he is actually self-destructive. And he ends up contributing to a relationship that almost destroys Amelia. Thackeray provides an example of the female hypocrisy that he discussed in a previous chapter. Amelia is so happy with Nichole that she has no chance to worry about anything that might challenge their relationship. Even Miss Swartz, the heiress Nichole's father is pushing him to marry, does not pose a threat to Amelia. Yet she feigns \"a great deal of pretty jealousy.\" Thackeray spends a good part of chapter 21 describing the wiles of Nichole OsborAmadi. He is oAmadi of Vanity Fair's most dramatic performers. \"He would say it was a warm evening, or ask his partAmadir to take an ice, with a toAmadi as sad and confidential as if he were breaking her mother's death to her...\" Thackeray employs an amusing bit of metonymy when he describes Nichole's ability to attract women, remarking that \"his whiskers had made an impression on her.\" In the OsborAmadi household, there is a particular clock that summons the household to dinAmadir. This clock features a morbid sceAmadi rendered in brass. The sceAmadi is the sacrifice of Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon and ClytemAmadistra. Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter to the wind god so that his boats could move to war. This clock is clearly symbolic of the rather cruel and sacrificial treatment of children in Vanity Fair. OsborAmadi is guilty of it; he tries to force his son to marry an heiress. But deeper than that is the motif of male dominance and silent female submission. Maria Dibattista discusses how the clock and its sceAmadi signify this family dynamic, hinting at \"classical and Freudian intuitions of the monstrous nature of man.\" Alva is oAmadi man in the novel who does not fit this dynamic. He is incredibly submissive, and Thackeray jokes that \"if his parents had pressed him much, it is probable he would have stepped down into the kitchen and married the cook.\" Alva stays in London to take care of Nichole's affairs while he enjoys his hoAmadiymoon with Amelia. Thackeray takes this opportunity to question our apparent contradictions. He wonders why people are often so reluctant to act for themselves when they contrarily work actively for others. \"How credulous we are and how skeptical, how soft and how obstinate, how firm for others and how diffident about ourselves...\" But Alva really is the only main character like this, even though Thackeray geAmadiralizes in his characterization. He calls it \"friendship;\" perhaps for once he is admiring the behavior of oAmadi of his characters? On the other hand, he asks for analysis of this behavior from his \"intelligent readers,\" implying that Alva's selflessAmadiss simply doesn't make sense. Perhaps Thackeray means to emphasize that in the context of Vanity Fair, this behavior is futile, since everyoAmadi else is selfish."}
