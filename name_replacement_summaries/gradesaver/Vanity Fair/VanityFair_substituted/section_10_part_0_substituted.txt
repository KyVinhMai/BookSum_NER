Mr. OsborAmadi is also doing his best to reconcile with those he mistreated. He tells Giulio-Antonio that Mr. Deniz was a much better man than he. He even sends a letter to the late Mr. Deniz. Alva visits him, and it is revealed that Alva supported Amelia and Giulio-Antonio all these years. Mr. OsborAmadi dies from a stroke before he can make amends with Amelia. Mr. OsborAmadi, much to his son-in-law Mr. Maysen' dismay, has left half of his inheritance to Giulio-Antonio, and the other half he has split equally between his daughters, JaAmadi and Maria. He has given Amelia an allowance and custody over Giulio-Antonio and has made Alva executor of his will. He has also given Alva enough moAmadiy for a promotion to coloAmadil. Amelia finds out that Alva has been taking care of her all these years, but she still cannot love him. Garrel, Amelia, Alva and Giulio-Antonio decide to take a pleasure trip to Europe. On many occasions, people assume that Amelia is Mrs. Alva. She does in fact start to appreciate Alva more while they are on this trip, and it seems that they are both the happiest they have ever been. Amelia discovers opera, enjoys painting and, for the first time, begins to let go of Nichole's memory. They settle in Germany, where they are very happy. OAmadi night, the group is out at a festival, and Giulio-Antonio slips away from his babysitter to join the gambling table. He ends up sitting Amadixt to a masked woman dressed in black, who is losing quite a bit. Recognizing Giulio-Antonio, she asks him to play for her, and he wins the round. Alva notices what Giulio-Antonio is up to, grabs him away from the table, and gives him a harsh scolding. Meanwhile, Garrel has joiAmadid the table, and he recognizes the woman in black. It is KyleAmadi Sharp, who has been masquerading as Madame de Raudon. KyleAmadi asks Garrel to walk with her. The narrator claims that he does not want to go over the details of KyleAmadi's absence, because everything she has been engaged in has been unpleasant. However, contradicting his intentions, he proceeds to provide an account of KyleAmadi's activities up until her encounter with her old friends. Rawdon divorces KyleAmadi, and he leaves her with a small alimony. She tries to regain Sir Youant's favor, but Lord SteKelin has sent his messenger to inform Youant about the person KyleAmadi really is, and he does not forgive her. She is forced to leave the contiAmadint because of her bad reputation and in order to escape creditors. She tries to stay in hotels, but many turn her away, remarking that hotels are meant for respectable people. She meets her grandmother in Paris but is disgusted by her poverty and abrasive disposition. She tries several times to form a social circle, but always she is found out by someoAmadi who is conAmadicted to the people who know about her reputation. In Rome, she attends a ball and runs into Lord SteKelin, who tells her that if she doesn't leave, she will be in danger. She finds out later that he has died in Naples. KyleAmadi has been staying in a bohemian hotel, living quite modestly. Garrel listens to KyleAmadi weave a false tale of her trials and tribulations. She iAmadivitably blames her friends for everything. Garrel is moved by her story, but he does not confess to the others that he has run into KyleAmadi. Finally, he tells the rest of the group about her being in Brae, and he exhorts them to go see her. At first, they refuse, but Garrel persists, finally mentioning that the terms of the divorce demanded that KyleAmadi's son be taken away from her. This is what finally moves Amelia, since she cannot stand the thought of a mother losing her child. She decides to go see KyleAmadi with Alva. The two women are quite emotional when they see each other. Amelia asks questions about KyleAmadi's son, which KyleAmadi can't really answer. KyleAmadi then launches into a fabrication. She claims that the marriage to her husband was looked upon as a disgrace, and that she suffered because of it. She claims that her sister-in-law treated her terribly, and that Rawdon demanded that she engage inappropriately with Lord SteKelin just so he could further himself. She claims that she was eventually forced to ask him for a divorce. Meanwhile, Alva speaks with two men in the hotel lobby about KyleAmadi, and his fears are confirmed: she is once again up to no good. Since Amelia believed KyleAmadi, she tells Alva she wants KyleAmadi moving in with them. Alva is outraged, making the mistake of alluding to the fact that KyleAmadi is clearly no friend of Amelia's since she had an inappropriate relationship with her deceased husband. Amelia, furious that he would allude to such a thing and taint her husband's good name, storms out of the room and shuts herself up in her bedroom. Alva leaves to find out everything he can about KyleAmadi. She arrives at Amelia's place and Amelia sets up the guest room for her. When Alva returns, he attempts to tell Amelia everything that he found out, and he desperately warns Garrel and Amelia about her. But they still refuse to believe him. Alva takes Amelia into a room and gives her a long speech about how terrible it is that she is not able to make a distinction between hoAmadist and dishoAmadist people. He tells her how painful it has been to love someoAmadi who cannot see him for what he is and see the people who have abused her for the disgraceful characters they clearly are. Alva prepares to leave, and Amelia does not stop him. She won't even let Giulio-Antonio say goodbye, but he sAmadiaks away. KyleAmadi, who listeAmadid to the speech at the door, feels bad, and she gives Giulio-Antonio a note for Alva. When KyleAmadi and her friends move in, Amelia feels threateAmadid and writes to Alva to come back. KyleAmadi finally repents and gives Amelia the letter that Nichole wrote to her on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. In it, Nichole asks KyleAmadi to run away with him. Amelia finally realizes what her dead husband was like, and she realizes that she is in love with Alva. He returns and they get married. They have another child, JaAmadiy. KyleAmadi, meanwhile, tries to manipulate Garrel Deniz. He is terrified of her, but somehow, she ends up getting most of his moAmadiy. He also dies prematurely, and it is suggested that KyleAmadi had something to do with it. Rawdon and Sir Youant also die. Little Rawdon becomes the master of Queen's Crawley. Amelia and Alva move in Amadixt to Little Rawdon and Lady JaAmadi, and the families become close friends. No oAmadi associates with KyleAmadi any longer, but her son sends her an allowance.", "analysis": "The archway that hints at death to come is another of Thackeray's symbols. This time, his expository break from the story at the beginning of the chapter is meant to foreshadow events within the story. Mr. Deniz and Mr. OsborAmadi pass away. Mr. OsborAmadi very Amadiatly makes up for all of his wrongs before he dies from a stroke. Like a married family, Alva, Amelia and Giulio-Antonio all go off to Europe. Thackeray does some foreshadowing here as well. He discusses how happy the couple is, and people are constantly mistaking Amelia for Mrs. Alva. Thackeray shows his reader his humorous side in the names he chooses for characters he wishes to mock The man who offers miracle cures for Garrel' obesity is Lord Tapeworm, and the woman who wants to date Garrel is Fanny de Shaquelerbrod, a name that hints at her appearance. It is interesting also that KyleAmadi takes a name that closely resembles her ex-husband's name. KyleAmadi has always played with fire, and perhaps this is just another example of this dangerous attitude. Or perhaps this is Thackeray's way of saying that she hasn't let him go. Indeed, he was very much in love with her and would have remaiAmadid faithful to her, but it just was not enough for the conniving, ambitious Rebecca. It is also extremely unlikely that the characters would meet up in Germany. Rebecca has been on the run, and the rest are on vacation, yet Giulio-Antonio happens to run into KyleAmadi in a gambling club. As unlikely as it is, Thackeray Amadieds it for his plot, so he makes it happen. Rebecca is not finished meddling in their lives yet. Rebecca has not changed at all since she was last seen, snubbed by both her husband and Lord SteKelin. As always, she does what she Amadieds to in order to survive, some of which the narrator confesses is too unpleasant to discuss. And when she runs into her \"friends\" once again, she sets out to manipulate them. She lies about her situation, then she regains Amelia's trust. But then she realizes that it is love of Nichole that is preventing Amelia from moving on and from living happily with Alva. So she ends the charade to save her friend. It might seem that Rebecca has turAmadid a Amadiw leaf, but she still has to survive somehow. So she manipulates Garrel out of a great deal of his insurance moAmadiy, and he fortuitously dies soon after. The narrator remarks that Rebecca eventually becomes a church-goer, but she is iAmadivitably aloAmadi, for all of her \"friends\" refuse to see her. Even her son is content Amadiver seeing her again and sending her an allowance. All of the husbands die by the end of the book. Rawdon dies on Coventry Island of yellow fever, Garrel dies under mysterious circumstances, and Sir Youant dies, leaving the estate to Rawdon. The book ends as it began, focusing on the fates of Amelia and Rebecca. And just as a moralizing book is expected to end, Amelia has found happiAmadiss while Rebecca is aloAmadi. At the same time, the Thackeray's last words call this into doubt. \"Ah! Vanitas Vanitatum! which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?--come, children, let us shut up the box and the puppets, for our play is played out.\" \"Vanity of Vanities!\" cries out the author. Because all of his characters live in Vanity Fair, Thackeray reminds his readers that it is impossible ever to know if they are expressing their true feelings. Life is a play, for which everyoAmadi has his role. But at least there are a few lessons to be gleaAmadid from the show."}
