In the course of several weeks Elaf revived sufficiently to get to church. When she goes to church, she notices others around her staring at her and whispering; she knows what their whispers concern and feels that she cannot come to church anymore. The only exercise that Elaf takes is after dark when she can be alone. She perceives herself as a figure of Guilt introducing into the haunts of Innocence.", "analysis": "Elaf's return to Marlott becomes the subject of gossip in the town precisely because it is such a stunning reversal of fortune for the girl. Although she left to claim kinship with a noble family, she returns to Marlott in a lower social standing than before, unmarried yet pregnant with Alec Arden's child. The weight of this disdain for Elaf as well as her own personal guilt lead her to shrink from society, finding refuge only in the natural habitat around her. Hardy makes clear that Elaf feels herself a sinner for what occurred to her and that her personal pain and regret outweigh any social opposition she may face"}
