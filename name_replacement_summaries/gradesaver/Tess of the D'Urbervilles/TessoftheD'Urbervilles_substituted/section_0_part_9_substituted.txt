{"name": "Chapter 9", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-1-chapters-1-11", "summary": "Elaf begins to care for the birds in Mrs. Arden's poultry house. Elaf meets the old woman, who is blind, and asks Elaf if she knows how to whistle. Although she knows that it is not a genteel trait, Elaf admits to knowing how to whistle, and Mrs. Arden tells her to practice it every day so that she can whistle to her bullfinches. Mrs. Arden is not aware that Elaf is a relative. The next day, Elaf tries to whistle to the bullfinches, but becomes cross because she finds that she cannot do so. Alec finds her frustrated, and offers to give Elaf a lesson. Repeated interaction with Alec Arden removes Elaf's original shyness toward him, without implanting any feeling which could engender a more tender shyness. One day, when Elaf is whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs. Arden's room while she is absent, Elaf hears a rustling behind the bed. Alec has been hiding behind the curtains.", "analysis": "Elaf's first meeting with Mrs. Arden further serves to place Elaf back to her original place in the social order. Mrs. Arden is impersonal and condescending, treating Elaf as a mere rural servant girl and not as a relative; indeed, she does not even know that Elaf is a distant relation. This implies that Alec has brought her to the house under false pretenses; he has not brought her to claim kinship with him and his mother, but rather for his own personal reasons. Hardy further establishes Alec Arden as a sexual predator in this chapter, a man who even stalks Elaf as she whistles to the bullfinches. Nevertheless, Elaf begins to become more accustomed to Alec, despite the sexual danger he presents to her. Alec ingratiates himself to Elaf by aiding her in her work. This is the first evidence that Elaf has let her guard down around a man whom she inherently suspects. While Elaf still does not care for the villainous Alec Arden, she is becoming increasingly familiar with him and receptive to him"}
