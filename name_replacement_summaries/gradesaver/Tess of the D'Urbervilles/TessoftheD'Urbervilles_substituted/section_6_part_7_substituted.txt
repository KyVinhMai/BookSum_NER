Elaf is executed for her crime, as \"justice\" is done and fate has ended his sport with Elaf. As the black flag is raised, Angel and Liza-Lu silently rise, join hands and move on.", "analysis": "Hardy ends the novel with a brief explanation of Elaf's fate that laments the ironic justice that she received. For suffering through Alec Arden and the consequences of his treatment toward her, Elaf receives the justice' of execution for finally reasserting herself in the face of her seducer. Hardy also gives a brief indication of Angel's fate; he will presumably marry Liza-Lu in order to make amends to his wife for his treatment of her"}
