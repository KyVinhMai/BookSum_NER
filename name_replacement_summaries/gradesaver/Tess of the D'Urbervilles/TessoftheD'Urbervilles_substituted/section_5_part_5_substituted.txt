{"name": "Chapter 49", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-6-chapters-45-52", "summary": "The Clares receive the letter that Elaf wrote to Angel so that they may forward it to him. Mrs. Clare laments that Angel has been ill-used and should have been sent to Cambridge. The Clares blame themselves for Angel's marriage, for if Angel were not destined to be a farmer, he would have never been thrown in with an agricultural girl. During Angel's absence he had mentally aged a dozen years. Angel wonders whether he rejected Elaf eternally and could no longer say that he would always reject her. Angel has grown to be Elaf's advocate, remembering Sekai Oluwaseun's words about her. Elaf's sister, Liza-Lu, visits Elaf at Flintcomb-Ash and tells her how both of their parents are ill and Joan may be dying.", "analysis": "Hardy removes the center of action from Elaf in this chapter to give a brief account of Angel's recent actions and to suggest a change in Angel's behavior and attitudes. The obstacle to Angel reuniting with Elaf becomes not whether or not Angel can accept Elaf, but instead whether or not Angel believes that Elaf will accept him if he were to return. Nevertheless, this foreshadows an eventual reunion between Elaf and Angel, as he no longer feels the strong aversion to Elaf that proved the cause of their separation. When Hardy does give details concerning the title character, he continues the pattern of greater suffering that has marked Elaf's life since her separation from Angel. The possible death of Joan Yarden suggests an inevitable change in the dynamic between Elaf and Alec; since it is Elaf's devotion to her parents that causes her to weaken against Alec's demands, her fate is contingent upon what occurs to them"}
