{"name": "Chapter 28", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-4-chapters-25-34", "summary": "Elaf's refusal does not permanently daunt Clare, knowing that the negative is often the preface to a later affirmative. Angel asks Elaf if she loves another man, but she says that this is not the reason for her refusal. She says that it is for his own good. Elaf wonders why nobody has told Angel the entirety of Elaf's history. When Angel asks Elaf once more, she tells him that she will tell him all about himself. She vows to tell him on Sunday. Elaf feels that she cannot help giving in and marrying Angel, but feels that it is wrong and it may kill Angel when he finds out about her.", "analysis": "Hardy prolongs the conflict between Angel and Elaf concerning marriage throughout this chapter, thus illustrating Angel's persistence and the intensity of his love for Elaf. However, in equal measure this demonstrates the great extent to which Elaf believes that her history prevents any possibility of happiness with Angel Clare. This persistence and intensity serve to demonstrate the inadequacy of Elaf's refusal and inaction. Hardy demonstrates that her refusal stems from some sense of selfishness; Elaf believes that she cannot be happy with Angel if he knows about her past, yet she cannot marry him without revealing such details"}
