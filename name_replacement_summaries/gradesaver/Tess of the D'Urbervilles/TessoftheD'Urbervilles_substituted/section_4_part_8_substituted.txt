{"name": "Chapter 42", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-5-chapters-35-44", "summary": "Elaf starts again alone toward Chalk-Newton, where she has breakfast at an inn. At this inn, several young men are troublesomely complimentary to her because of her good looks. After leaving the inn, Elaf covers her chin and hair with a handkerchief and cuts off her eyebrows to deflect against men's admiration. She thinks that she will always be ugly as long as Angel is not with her. Elaf walks onward, from farm to farm in the direction of the place from which Marian had written her. Elaf finally reaches Flintcomb-Ash, the place of Marian's sojourn. The place is barren and rough. Elaf's plain appearance surprises Marian, who thinks that she has been abused. Elaf asks that Marian not call her Mrs. Clare. Marian tells Elaf that she will be employed at swede-hacking, a rough profession. Elaf asks Marian to say nothing about Angel, for she does not wish to bring his name down to the dirt.", "analysis": "In this chapter, Hardy focuses on the innate sexuality within Elaf Yarden, framing it as a force that Elaf can do little to control and which remains the center of her life's maladies. Elaf has remained the focus of sexual attention for primarily manipulative or self-serving reasons, as when her parents use her looks to gain her a gentleman husband and Alec Arden uses her only as an object for his lust. By rejecting Elaf, Angel Clare himself frames Elaf in terms of her sexuality. Her attempt to remove this sexual component of herself by making herself less attractive therefore represents a measure of self-defense. Elaf mutilates herself in order to ward off the attention that has damaged her. Flintcomb-Ash serves as a territorial representation of the adversity that Elaf faces. The territory is barren and rough, in contrast to the more idyllic region of Talbothays Dairy; this parallels Elaf's impoverished situation as well as her new appearance. Yet Elaf accepts the surroundings at Flintcomb-Ash largely because of the adversity it offers; she considers it as a form of purgatory, as shown when she refuses to allow Marian to speak about Angel, whom she still considers too noble for the conditions she now faces"}
