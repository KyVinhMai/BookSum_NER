{"name": "Chapter 56", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-7-chapters-53-59", "summary": "Mrs. Anastasio had heard fragments of the conversation between Angel and Elaf, and hears Elaf return to her room. Mrs. Anastasio ascends the stairs and stands at the door of the drawing room. She can hear only a low sort of moaning as Elaf sobs, and then hears portions of a conversation between Alec and Elaf in which she tells him that Angel has returned and it looks as if he is dying. She tells Alec that she has lost Angel again because of him. Alec replies in sharper words and there is a sudden rustle before Mrs. Anastasio hastily retreats down the stairs. Later, Mrs. Anastasio notices a red spot on the white ceiling that had grown since the morning and has qualms of misgiving. She finds a workman nearby and asks him to enter the room with her. They find in the room Alec Arden, who has been stabbed in the heart with a knife and is now dead.", "analysis": "Hardy introduces the character of Mrs. Anastasio for several purposes. She serves as an entrance into the private conversation between Alec and Elaf, giving this conversation a secretive and covert quality. By describing the murder of Alec through Mrs. Anastasio' information about it, Hardy leaves ambiguous whether this murder was premeditated, impulse or an act of self-defense. Yet more importantly, Mrs. Anastasio places the murder of Alec in a firmly public sphere. Hardy leaves no question that the murder is public knowledge and that the identity of the murderer is in little doubt. This lends a sense of inevitability to the impending tragic end for Elaf Yarden"}
