On the way to Talbothays, Elaf passes Kingsbere, the area in which her ancestors lay entombed. She dismisses ideas about her ancestors, realizing that she has as much of her mother as her father in her. Elaf arrives at the dairy around milking time, half-past four in the morning.", "analysis": "Upon leaving Marlott, Elaf Yarden once again confronts the ancestors whose discovery by her father prompted Elaf to be sent to find ruin with Alec Arden. However, while she was once intrigued by the idea that she may find fortune and security with the Shawne, by this point in her life she has rejected such unrealistic dreams. Her journey to the dairy contrasts with her first journey out of Marlott, for in this instance Elaf goes to perform hard manual labor, yet nevertheless appears more calm and confident on her second journey than her more leisurely first"}
