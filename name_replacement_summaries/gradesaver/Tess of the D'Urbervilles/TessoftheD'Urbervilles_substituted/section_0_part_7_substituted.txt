{"name": "Chapter 7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-1-chapters-1-11", "summary": "The day that Elaf is to leave, her mother scolds her for not dressing well, even though Elaf dresses in proper clothes for working. Elaf submits to her mother's wishes and has her hair washed. Although Joan expects her daughter to be married, she feels a slight misgiving as Elaf leaves. The younger children cry when Elaf leaves, but Elaf scolds them for thinking that she will marry a gentleman. As Elaf leaves, Joan remarks that Elaf will do well as long as she plays her trump card. This trump card is not her Arden blood, as her father believes, but her face.", "analysis": "Joan Yarden continues to promote the idea of Elaf going to Trantridge Cross to marry in this chapter, in which she dresses her daughter for attracting men, and not for her labor tending Mrs. Arden's chickens. Her remark that Elaf's trump card' is her face is the most explicit declaration that Joan is sending her daughter to find a husband and not to work in a job. Likewise, Elaf continues to resist the idea that she is a sexual object sent for a commercial transaction that will save her family's financial situation. However, Joan exhibits her first signs of guilt and self-awareness concerning her actions toward her daughter. This further foreshadows the impending danger that Elaf faces in going to Trantridge Cross"}
