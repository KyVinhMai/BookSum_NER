{"name": "Chapter 29", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-4-chapters-25-34", "summary": "Dairyman Stevie tells the milkers at breakfast that Jack Dollop just got married to a widow-woman, and never married the matron's daughter. However, by marrying the widow lost her yearly allowance. Mrs. Stevie remarks that the widow should have told Jack sooner that the ghost of her first husband would trouble him. Britain Jari, a married helper from one of the cottages, says that she was justified in not telling him, for all is fair in love and war. For Elaf, what is comedy to her fellow workers is tragedy to her. Elaf refuses Angel once more. Dairyman Stevie sends Angel to go to the station, and Elaf agrees to accompany him.", "analysis": "The second anecdote about Jack Dollop serves an instructional purpose in this chapter, suggesting to Elaf that she is justified in not telling Angel about her now dead child. Although Elaf approaches this decision as one of tragedy, she nevertheless appears ready to accept the idea that she may rightfully withhold this information from Angel. The decreased likelihood that Elaf will reveal her experience with Alec Arden foreshadows greater conflict between Angel and Elaf rather than negating the possibility of it; now that Elaf may not tell Angel about her past at an opportune moment, Angel may learn of her secrets under less fortuitous conditions"}
