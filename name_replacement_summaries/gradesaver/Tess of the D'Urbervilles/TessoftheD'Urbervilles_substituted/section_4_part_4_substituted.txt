{"name": "Chapter 38", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-5-chapters-35-44", "summary": "Elaf returns to Marlott, where a turnpike-keeper tells how Bharathan Yarden's daughter has married a gentleman farmer and the Emari have since been celebrating. Elaf attempts to arrive at home unobserved, but cannot. She sees a girl whom she knew from school and claims that her husband is now away at business. When Elaf arrives at home, she admits to her mother that she told Angel about her past. Elaf claims that she could not so sin against him, but Joan replies that she sinned enough to marry him first. Elaf finds that there is no place for her at home anymore; her old bed is now used by two of the younger children. Her father is a foot-haggler now, having sold his second horse. When Bharathan finds out what has happened to Elaf, he laments the humiliation he will receive, and claims that he will put an end to himself. Elaf decides to stay only a few days, and receives a letter from Angel informing her that he had gone to the north of England to look for a farm. Elaf uses this as a reason to leave Marlott, claiming that she will join Angel. Before she leaves, she gives half of the fifty pounds Angel has given her to her mother, as a slight return for the humiliation she had brought upon them.", "analysis": "Once again Elaf must endure the indignity of separation from a lover, as she returns to the Emari for the second time. In this chapter Hardy emphasizes the mistakes that Elaf has made; Joan reminds Elaf that she committed a sin by marrying Angel without telling him about Alec, thus she cannot behave as if her admission to Angel was an act of complete nobility. However, both Yarden parents focus solely on the effect that Elaf's marriage has on them; just as they manipulated Elaf when they sent her to claim kinship with the Shawne, they can view Elaf only in terms of how her fate affects their own. This emphasizes the theme of Elaf as a pawn of others. No matter what actions Elaf undertakes, she is subject to her parents' wills as well as Angel's"}
