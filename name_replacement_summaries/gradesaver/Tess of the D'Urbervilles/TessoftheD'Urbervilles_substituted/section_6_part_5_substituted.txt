{"name": "Chapter 57", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-7-chapters-53-59", "summary": "Angel prepares to leave town, dejected. He walks to the first nearby train station, and as he travels he sees a woman running toward him. It is Elaf, who has been following him. She tells Angel that she has killed Alec, and smiles faintly as she tells him this. Elaf admits that she killed Alec when he taunted Elaf and called Angel by a foul name. Angel wonders what obscure strain in the Arden blood had led to this aberration of moral sense, if it were an aberration. Angel thinks about the legend of the Arden coach. He vows not to desert Elaf, and they continue together. They pass a deserted mansion, Bramshurst Court, where they rest.", "analysis": "Elaf and Angel finally reconcile in this chapter, but the circumstances under which Angel and Elaf find themselves render this reconciliation short-lived. Hardy finally connects Elaf to the Arden legacy in this chapter, allowing that her Arden heritage has endowed her with a faulty moral deficiency that has made her capable of murder. Angel himself relates the murder of Alec to the legend of the Arden coach. However, Elaf's action may be seen as a reversal of this legend, for in this instance it is the victimized woman who strikes out against a rapacious Arden. Elaf inverts her family history, recalling the Arden history and refuting its legends"}
