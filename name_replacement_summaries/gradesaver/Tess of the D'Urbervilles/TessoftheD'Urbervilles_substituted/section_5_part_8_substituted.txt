When the family reach their destination, the innkeeper tells them that they have no lodgings there, for he received their request too late. The family instead stays in the Arden Aisle church where the family vault is located. Alec Arden finds Elaf there. Marian and Sekai discuss Angel; Marian thinks that they will never have Angel no matter what, and they should try to mend his situation with Elaf. They write to Angel that he should look to his wife if he loves her as she loves him.", "analysis": "The Yarden family, driven from their home and having no lodgings, find themselves in the crypt of the family from which they are descended. This symbolizes the final descent of the Shawne, as the last remaining members of the family take residence with the remains of the dead nobility. Nevertheless, the actions of Sekai Oluwaseun and Marian to repair the marriage between Angel Clare and Elaf may signal a turning point in the novel. This action reinforces the love that Elaf has for Angel, for if she cared for him less, both girls would attempt to pursue Angel for themselves. By behaving selflessly, Marian and Sekai demonstrate an equal selflessness within Elaf"}
