{"name": "Chapter 15", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-2-chapters-12-15", "summary": "Elaf began to note the passing of anniversaries, such as her first arrival at Trantridge and the fateful night at The Chase. Almost suddenly Elaf changed from a simple girl to a complex woman. Her eyes grow larger and more eloquent. She wonders if chastity, once lost, is always lost and waits for a new departure. She vows that there will be no more talk of Arden castles, and prepares to go to the Talbothays dairy.", "analysis": "Hardy makes explicit in this chapter what he implied earlier, elucidating the transformative events that moved Elaf from a timid girl to a strong and courageous woman. Her rebirth during the baptism of Freedom is followed by Elaf's decision to leave Marlott for a place in which she may start her life anew. However, at this point Hardy introduces one of the most important themes of the novel: the question of the extent to which sins may be forgiven. In this instance, the question is given explicitly: can Elaf regain her chastity after one indiscretion. Although Elaf herself appears as evidence that purity may be regained, this question will provide significant thematic material throughout the novel"}
