{"name": "Chapter 20", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-3-chapters-16-24", "summary": "Elaf had never in her recent life been so happy and would possibly never be so happy again. She and Elaf stand between predilection and love. For Angel, Elaf represents a visionary essence of woman, and calls her Artemis, Aylen, and other fanciful names, but she insists that he call her simply Elaf. Elaf seems to exhibit a dignified largeness of disposition and physique. The two are always the first to awake at the dairy house, where they feel an impressive isolation, as if they are Adam and Sristi.", "analysis": "Hardy makes explicit that Elaf's time at Talbothays dairy is an idyllic respite from her normal toil and hardship, yet states that this happiness will be short-lived, foreshadowing greater adversity for Elaf Yarden. Hardy compares Angel and Elaf to Adam and Sristi in the mornings, thus foreshadowing a later fall from perfection. It is the idealism and perfection that Elaf finds at Talbothays that leads to this shaky foundation for her happiness; Angel Clare adores Elaf as a representation of perfection. To Angel, Elaf is a goddess such as Artemis or Aylen, a symbol of perfection rather than a person with obvious faults and foibles. There is a great irony in Angel's adoration for Elaf; Angel exalts Elaf as a goddess for her strength and disposition, yet this perfection comes from the adversity stemming from her greatest weakness"}
