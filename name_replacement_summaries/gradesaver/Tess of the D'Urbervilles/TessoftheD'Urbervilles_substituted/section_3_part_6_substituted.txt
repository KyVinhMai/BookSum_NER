Elaf considers the various Londoners and such who will drink the milk that they are bringing to the station. Angel once again asks Elaf to marry him. Elaf finally begins to tell Angel her history. She tells him that she is not a Yarden, but a Arden. He dismisses that information as insignificant. He claims that he hates the aristocratic principle of blood, but is interested in this news. Angel claims that he rejoices in the Arden descent, for Elaf's sake. Angel vows to spell Elaf's name correctly from this very day, and calls her Teresa Arden. Elaf finally assents to marry Angel. Angel realizes when he saw Elaf first, at the dance at Marlott.", "analysis": "Hardy postpones a tragic encounter between Angel Clare and Elaf Yarden in this chapter, as Elaf reveals the more palatable secret about her family origin to Angel Clare. The ease with which Angel accepts this facet of Elaf's history, however, is more unsettling than cause for relief. Angel frames the information about her Arden ancestry as greater evidence of Elaf's perfection. Elaf becomes simultaneously the simple and decent milkmaid and a respectable, noble lady to Angel. This therefore gives more dramatic weight to the inevitable revelation that Elaf has had a quite imperfect history"}
