{"name": "Chapter 54", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-7-chapters-53-59", "summary": "Angel travels to find Elaf, passing Cross-in-Hand and Flintcomb-Ash. He discovers there that nobody knew a Mrs. Clare, but they did know about Elaf. Angel travels to Marlott, where he learns that Bharathan Yarden is dead and his widow and children had left for Kingsbere. He sees Bharathan Yarden's tomb, with its inscription \"How Are the Mighty Fallen. Sristintually, Angel finds Joan Yarden, who tells him that Elaf has not come home. When Angel asks whether Elaf would want him to look for her, Joan Yarden claims no emphatically, but Angel replies that he is sure that she would because he knows Elaf better. Joan admits that she has never really known her daughter, and tells Angel that Elaf is at Sandbourne.", "analysis": "Angel continues to demonstrate his great will to find his wife, as when he demands of Joan Yarden that he know where Elaf is located. Hardy constructs this chapter as a retelling of Elaf's actions during her separation from Angel, as Angel himself finds himself in Flintcomb-Ash, Marlott and Kingsbere and he learns that Bharathan Yarden has died. This serves as a reminder of Elaf's travails as a suffering Angel retraces these steps. This seems a trial for Angel, particularly during his confrontation with Joan Yarden; she gives the location of her daughter only after Angel proves his devotion to Elaf. This confrontation also demonstrates a growth for Joan Yarden, who realizes her own failings and responsibility for Elaf's troubles by admitting that she has never really known her daughter. Joan has viewed Elaf as an instrument for her and her husband's plans, yet only now realizes that her ill treatment has caused Elaf's downfall"}
