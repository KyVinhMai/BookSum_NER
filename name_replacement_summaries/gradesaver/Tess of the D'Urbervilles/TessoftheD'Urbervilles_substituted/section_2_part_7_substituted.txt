{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-3-chapters-16-24", "summary": "The next morning Dairyman Stevie orders his workers to overhaul the mead, for there is garlic in it that has spoiled the milk. While searching for garlic in the field, Angel finds Elaf and they search together. Dairyman Stevie finds them and tells her that she should not be out in the fields, for she was not feeling well a day or so ago. Elaf mentions to Angel that Sekaiy Oluwaseun and Clair look pretty, but Angel insists on Elaf's superiority. Elaf finally tells Angel to marry one of them if she wants a dairywoman and not a lady, and not to think of marrying her. From this day Elaf forces herself to take pains to avoid Angel.", "analysis": "Elaf begins to retreat from any possible romantic engagement with Angel Clare in this chapter, as he makes his feelings for her more explicit. She rejects Angel's affection for her because she believes that he wants a simple girl as a wife and not a member of a noble family. The rationale for Elaf's rejection of Angel is ironic, for her shame stems not from the more lowly details of her history, but rather the lofty ones. She fears that she may be exposed as a noble lady, not that she may be exposed as an unchaste woman"}
