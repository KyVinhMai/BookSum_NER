{"name": "Chapter 8", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-1-chapters-1-11", "summary": "As Alec and Elaf drive the carriage toward Trantridge, Elaf becomes frightened by the quick movement of the horse as they go down the hill. She grasps Alec's arm, but he tells her to grasp his waist so that he can still control the horse. When the horse becomes calm, she reprimands him for driving so recklessly, but he tells her to put her arms around his waist again. She says never, but he persists. She says that she thought that he would be kind to her as her kinsman. He calls her rather sensitive for a cottage girl, and calls her an artful hussy.", "analysis": "The problems that Alec and Elaf have on the carriage traveling toward Trantridge serve as a bridge between two of the most important events in the novel, simultaneously building on Elaf's guilt concerning the death of the family horse and foreshadowing later events in which Elaf finds herself in danger with Alec Arden. In this chapter, Hardy intertwines the danger of their travel along with sexuality, as Alec demands that Elaf grasp his waist as the carriage tumbles down the hill. Alec exploits moments of danger for his own sexual gain, presenting Elaf with danger in order to use her as a sexual conquest. Alec himself symbolizes the confluence of these two qualities, a character who presents his sexuality along with a great capacity for violence. Alec's reprimand of Elaf as \"rather sensitive for a cottage girl\" serves to shatter the idea that Elaf may marry a gentleman. As Alec notes, no matter her distant family connections, Elaf is of such lowly birth that she may consent to be the mistress of a gentleman but not his wife"}
