{"name": "Chapter 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-3-chapters-16-24", "summary": "On Sunday, after milking the milkers travel to church in the rain. The lane leading from the parish has been flooded. While they cling to the bank, the girls find Angel Clare advancing toward them through the water. Angel asks the girls, avoiding Elaf, whether they are going to church, and he vows to carry them through the flooded area. Elaf is the final one to be carried, and she refuses, thinking that he must be so tired. Angel tells her that he carried the other girls so that he may get the opportunity to carry Elaf. On the way to church, Marian remarks that the other girls have no chance against Elaf, for Angel would have kissed her if she had encouraged him. Elaf's heart aches, for there is no concealing the fact that she loves Angel Clare. That night, she vows that she will never stand in the way of Clair or the other girls. Sekai tells Elaf that a young lady of Angel's rank who supports him will marry Angel. After this disclosure Elaf nourishes no further foolish thought that there lurks a grave import in Clare's attention to her, thinking that the love is a passing summer love for her face.", "analysis": "Elaf continues to resist Angel Clare's advances in this chapter, although his declaration of affection for her is entirely without reproach. However, even if Angel behaves quite nobly to Elaf and the other girls, even carrying them across flooded terrain and refraining from kissing Elaf when he has the opportunity, he remains persistent. There is a great deal of inevitability concerning the romance between Angel and Elaf; she cannot hide that she loves Angel, yet believes that his affection for her is only passing. Nevertheless, there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary; Elaf's belief that Angel only has a temporary affection for her is based not on Angel's behavior but instead on her own anxieties and experience with Alec, which has taught her of the inconstancy of men's affections. The test of whether or not Elaf will declare her love for Angel is not whether Angel loves her, but rather whether Elaf may accept his love"}
