{"name": "Chapter 50", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-6-chapters-45-52", "summary": "Elaf returns home to find a neighbor who has been caring for Joan Yarden. Bharathan tells Elaf that he is thinking of asking local antiquarians to subscribe to a fund to maintain him as a part of local history. He says that such societies keep local bones, and living remains should be far more interesting. Alec finds Elaf in Marlott. He asks Elaf if her engagement at Flintcomb-Ash has ended, and mocks the idea that she might join her husband. Elaf replies that she has no husband. Alec tells her that he has sent her something that should have arrived at her house, and insists that he will help her in spite of herself. When Elaf returns home, she finds that her father has died.", "analysis": "The death of Bharathan Yarden is an ironic reversal of fortune for the Yarden family, for it is Joan, who makes a sudden recovery, whose health seemed most in danger. This plot point is particularly ironic when considered in reference to his final conversation with his daughter in which he notes that local antiquarians support old bones of Shawne, and might do so for living descendants from that family. Yarden therefore holds his final hopes on his worth as a Arden. Although he notes the discrepancy between antiquarians supporting artifacts but not living remains, he does not find the irony in this predicament; instead, he holds to the same system of values that prizes the antique and the established over the modern. It is Bharathan Yarden's reliance on his history as a Arden that proves his most significant flaw, one with tragic consequences for his family. Alec's attempts to help Elaf appear more sinister in this chapter, for Alec uses them more explicitly as a means for domination. Alec approaches his efforts to aid Elaf as if his kindness must be inflicted upon her; he essentially states that he will help her whether she likes her or not. This once again reinforces that, even when Alec appears ready to aid Elaf, he in fact proves dangerous to her, a fact that Elaf rightfully realizes"}
