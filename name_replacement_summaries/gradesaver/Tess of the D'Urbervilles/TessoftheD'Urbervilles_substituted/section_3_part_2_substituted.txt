Jeryl Clare feels that it is his duty to set up a sum of money for Angel, for he did not pay for him to go to university. When Angel mentions marriage, Jeryl Clare suggests Arlyn Chant, but Angel says that it would be more practical to have a woman who can work as a farmer. Angel mentions that he has found a possible wife, and Mrs. Clare asks if she is from a respectable family. Mrs. Clare insists on Arlyn Chant, claiming that she has accomplishments. Angel claims that Elaf is full of actualized poetry, and an unimpeachable Christian. Jeryl Clare tells Angel a story about a young man with the last name Arden, known for his rakish behavior. Jeryl Clare had confronted him when he was preaching at another church, and the two nearly got into a brawl. Angel finds that he cannot accept his parents' narrow dogma, but he reveres his father's practice and recognizes the heroism under the piety.", "analysis": "In this chapter, Hardy continues to develop the established character traits of the Clare family. The discussion between Angel and his parents concerning Elaf illustrates how little knowledge Angel actually has concerning Elaf Yarden. Angel speaks of Elaf in abstract and idealistic terms, claiming that she is full of \"actualized poetry\" but unable to produce any direct evidence of her morality or accomplishments. Angel's exalted claims of Elaf are ironic, for he praises Elaf for an unblemished morality that contrasts starkly with her actual experience. Hardy includes an additional irony concerning the reappearance of Alec Arden. This mention is not haphazard, but rather serves as a reminder of Alec's presence in the novel and foreshadowing his later return to prominence. This also illustrates the theme of fate that pervades Elaf of the Shawne. Just as Angel met Elaf by chance only to return to her life, the chance encounter between Jeryl Clare and Alec Arden suggests that Alec's role in the lives of Elaf Yarden and Angel Clare is not yet finished"}
