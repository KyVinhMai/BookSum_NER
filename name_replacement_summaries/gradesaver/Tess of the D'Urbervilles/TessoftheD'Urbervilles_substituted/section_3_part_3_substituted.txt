{"name": "Chapter 27", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-4-chapters-25-34", "summary": "Angel returns to Talbothays, where he finds Elaf, who has recently awakened. Angel tells Elaf that he shall soon want to marry, and asks Elaf if she will be his wife. Elaf declares that she cannot be his wife, and she claims that the reason is that his father is a parson and his mother wouldn't want her to marry him. He counters these objections, telling her that he has discussed the matter with his parents. Angel then recounts the story that his father told him about Alec Arden, not mentioning the actual name, and when he asks Elaf about marriage once more she says that it cannot be.", "analysis": "Hardy shifts the burden of obstacles to the romance between Elaf and Angel to Elaf in this chapter, in which she refuses his proposal of marriage. Although Elaf claims that it is her lowly status and the objections that his parents would make to her as the rationale for her rejection of Angel, the mention of Alec Arden serves as a reminder that it is rather fear of her past that drives Elaf to reject Angel. Elaf views this as an insurmountable obstacle to her happiness; she cannot tell Angel about her past because he would reject her in turn, while she cannot keep it as a secret for he would inevitably learn of her more sordid history"}
