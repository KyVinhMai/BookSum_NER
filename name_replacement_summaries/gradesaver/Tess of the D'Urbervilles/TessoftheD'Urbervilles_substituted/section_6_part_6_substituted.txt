Elaf is reluctant to leave their shelter and go toward Southampton or London, for she wonders why they must put an end to all that is sweet and lovely. She says that what must come will come. Angel decides that they must finally leave the mansion, but Elaf wishes to stay, for she believes she will not last more than several weeks. Angel plans to take Elaf north, where they can sail from Wessex. They travel northward and reach Stonehenge. Elaf wishes to remain there, for Angel used to say that she was a heathen and thus Stonehenge is appropriate for her. Elaf asks Angel to look after Liza-Lu if he loses her and to marry her. Elaf falls asleep there, and as she sleeps a party of sixteen men surrounds Stonehenge to get Elaf. Elaf awakes, and asks Angel if they have come for her. Elaf admits that she is almost glad, for her happiness could not have lasted. She tells them that she is ready.", "analysis": "For a brief period, Elaf and Angel remain happily as husband and wife, yet this happiness is a nearly grotesque one, for the couple essentially has their honeymoon as they travel as fugitives. And, as both Elaf and Angel realize, this period of happiness is short-lived. Elaf knows that she will be caught, and thus plans for her husband and her family after her inevitable execution. This emphasizes the theme that Elaf is unable to escape her fate; Hardy offers no possibility that Elaf and Angel might escape England where Elaf might go unpunished. Despite the tragic conclusion to Elaf Yarden life, both Elaf and Angel accept her fate stoically, for this is a final end to her suffering. Having experienced pain and hardship almost entirely since leaving home for Trantridge, Elaf can only expect more difficulties, even after reuniting with Angel. The only option that Angel has before Elaf's demise is to ensure that her end is not protracted"}
