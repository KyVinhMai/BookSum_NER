When he visits her again, he says that if he cannot legitimize their former relations, he can at least assist her. He says that although his religious mania is over, he retains a little good nature. He says that he will make her family comfortable if only she will show confidence in him. She tells him not to mention her siblings, and if he wants to help them, he should do so without telling her. After Alec leaves, Elaf writes yet another letter to Angel, asking him to return to her. In this letter, she writes that she lives entirely for him and would be content to live with him as his servant if not as his wife.", "analysis": "Alec's offer to aid Elaf is yet another example of his use of his financial resources to exert control over Elaf, endearing himself to her by making himself essential for her survival. The significant difference in this offer to Elaf is that it does not aid her, but rather her family. Hardy has established that the Yarden family exerts a certain control over Elaf, as when her parents goaded her into claiming kinship with the Shawne after Elaf's mishap with the horse. While Elaf can survive the physical hardship that she faces at Flintcomb-Ash, she finds it more difficult to allow her parents to suffer similar adversity. Elaf's plea for Angel that he return to her is therefore her first sign of weakness with regard to Alec Arden, who has found the one way to break down Elaf's considerable defenses"}
