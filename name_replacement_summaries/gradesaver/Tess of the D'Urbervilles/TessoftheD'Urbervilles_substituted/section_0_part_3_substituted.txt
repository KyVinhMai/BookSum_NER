{"name": "Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-1-chapters-1-11", "summary": "Elaf remains with her comrades until dusk, thinking of the young man, Angel. When she arrives at home, she hears her mother singing as she rocks her youngest child to sleep. Mrs. Yarden still has some of the freshness of youth, but it is faint. She speaks in the local dialect, and tells her daughter what Bharathan Yarden learned that day. Mrs. Yarden thinks that great things will come of this. She also tells Elaf that Bharathan has fat around his heart, which could cause his death in ten years or ten days. He is now at Lovelle's, and wants to rest before his journey tomorrow with a load of beehives. Now that Elaf is home, Joan Yarden can go to Lovelle's to fetch her husband, but Joan herself does not return, so Elaf sends her brother Abraham. Elaf herself decides to go when Abraham does not return a half hour later.", "analysis": "This chapter serves to illustrate the Yarden home life, one in which Joan Yarden has little respite from her drudge work and little help from the rest of her family, particularly from her husband, who spends as much free time as possible at the local tavern. In fact, one of the few chances for enjoyment that Joan Yarden has is the opportunity to fetch her husband from Lovelle's and assume a position of authority over Bharathan. However, despite her difficult life, Joan Yarden is no a completely innocent victim; she proves herself as irresponsible as her husband, remaining at the bar when she means to take him away from it. Among the Emari, it is only Elaf who remains committed and responsible; she alone has the sense of responsibility to know that her family must come home"}
