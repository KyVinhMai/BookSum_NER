{"name": "Chapter 55", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410060617/https://www.gradesaver.com/tess-of-the-durbervilles/study-guide/summary-phase-7-chapters-53-59", "summary": "Angel reaches Sandbourne, a fashionable village that had recently experienced tremendous growth. Angel wonders where Elaf could be amidst the wealth and fashion around him. He asks the postman for the address of a Mrs. Clare, and then a Miss Yarden, but he does not know either. Another postal worker tells Angel the address of a Arden at The Herons. Angel goes to this lodging house and asks Mrs. Anastasio, the householder, for Teresa Arden. He learns that she has been passing as a married woman. Elaf appears, loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressing gown. Angel begs forgiveness for going away, but she says that it is too late. She says that she waited and waited, but Alec has won her back. She says that she hates Alec now, for he told her the lie that Angel would never come again. Angel can barely speak, but feels that Elaf had ceased to recognize the body before her as her husband.", "analysis": "The village of Sandbourne proves a stark contrast to the other regions in which Elaf has stayed; this village community is thriving and fashionable, and its description foreshadows the later revelation of this chapter that Elaf has returned to the sophisticated and urbane Alec Arden. Elaf herself comes to physically resemble this area, having adopted a more fashionable and stylish dress that endows her with an appearance of assurance and strength. Hardy juxtaposes Elaf with the now sickly and decrepit Angel, who demonstrates his weakness in comparison with Elaf. However, Angel's reappearance breaks Elaf's facade of strength, demonstrating that her decision to return to Alec is one of weakness and desperation. Significantly, Elaf does not blame Angel for what has occurred, but rather shifts the blame to Alec. This foreshadows the events that will drive the final chapters of the novel. Angel's realization that Elaf had not recognized the body before her as her husband parallels his earlier condemnation of Elaf as a different woman in Elaf's shape. In this situation, it is Elaf who rejects Angel, for she cannot reconcile what she believes about her husband with the actual person in front of her"}
