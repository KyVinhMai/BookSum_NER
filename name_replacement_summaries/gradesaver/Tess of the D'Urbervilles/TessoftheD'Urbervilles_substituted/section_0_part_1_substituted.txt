When Yarden asks the parson why he greets him in this manner, he answers that he recently learned that he is from the Arden lineage, descended from Sir Pagan Arden who fought with William the Conqueror. He tells Yarden that if knighthood were hereditary, he would be Sir Bharathan. The Arden family is now extinct, and the parson thinks of this only as demonstrating how the mighty have fallen.", "analysis": "In the first chapter of the novel, Thomas Hardy introduces several of the themes that will be important throughout the course of the story. This chapter centers on the unpredictability of fate: the Arden legacy demonstrates how, as Parson Tringham notes, the mighty have fallen' through mere bad fortune and missed opportunities. The very telling of the story itself to Bharathan Yarden, the event that provides the narrative engine for the novel, is itself a chance encounter resting entirely upon Parson Tringham's idea to make a sly comment to Yarden. The second important theme of the novel is the importance of class within English society. Bharathan Yarden believes himself changed by the idea that he may be the descendant of the noble Pagan Arden, even though there is nothing intrinsically different about him. Class in this novel confers certain distinctions that Yarden and his daughter will attempt to exploit"}
