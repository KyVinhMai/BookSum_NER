When Alice goes inside to tell Penelope, who is home alone, of the incident, Penelope decides to go downstairs and see what is on Tom's mind. As she descends, a description of the interior of the Lapham home in Nankeen Square--with its panelling, American iconography, and religious statues--is given. Penelope and Tom interact awkwardly at first, and they both turn red at the tense feeling between them. When Penelope tells Tom that she had just been reading a book, it turns out that the book is none other than Tears, Idle Tears. In the book, a woman allows the man she loves to marry another woman out of a sense of righteousness and self-sacrifice. This is an obvious parallel to Penelope's own situation, in which she plans to let Tom marry Irene, though she loves him. Still unaware of this similarity, however, Penelope merely says that she finds this kind of self-sacrifice to be unreasonable, and Tom agrees that lovers should behave more rationally than in the novel. As the conversation continues, Penelope asks Tom if it is true that Irene talks so much of her. When Tom returns that it is more apt to say that he asks Irene about Penelope constantly, Penelope is embarrassed and suggests that she will have to accordingly change her behavior. Tom rejects this prominently, however, and the air grows more tense as Tom draws attention to the fact that he and Penelope are alone together rather infrequently. When Tom suggests that Penelope has been avoiding him, she tries to shake it off, but Tom comes right out and confesses his love for Penelope. Penelope feels exposed and ashamed, since she blames herself for having possibly given Tom the impression that she was interested in him all along, while she was meant to be advocating for and advancing Irene's chances with Tom. She does not tell him, however, about her family's mistaken thought that Tom was interested in Irene, opting instead to tell him only that there is something wrong that she cannot tell him and that no \"human creature know\". In her shame, Penelope tells Tom that he should leave and never come back to speak of his love again, if he cares for her and her family. Tom suggests that he tell Silas or Persis about his love for Penelope to see how to best overcome whatever it is Penelope is dealing with, but Penelope remains vague in her complaints. She even goes so far as to tell him without reason that him involving her parents would \"make hate \". He resolves to come back the next day, and he leaves. On his way out, he passes Silas, who does not notice anything amiss", "analysis": "Chapters 14-19 focus primarily on the dinner thrown by the Coreys--a turning point in the novel--and the fallout that results from this event. Like other chapters in the book, this section touches and offers social commentary on many Gilded Age institutions--marriage, courtship, elite social clubs, explosive and exploitative business, and even the Church. On the other hand, certain thematic and symbolic signifiers are paid a great deal more attention in Chapters 14-19 than elsewhere in Howells' novel. These include the distinctions between activity and mimicry, between reality and fiction, and between what should be public and what should remain private. The idea of legitimate knowledge or action--as compared to mimicry or imitation--emerges very early on in these chapters. When Silas arrives at the Coreys' home, he puzzles over his gloves and removes them only because he seeks to imitate Tom, who he notices does not wear them . The gloves have heretofore come to be symbolic of the Laphams' ignorance of genteel habits, so their deployment here is particularly effective in conveying Silas' naivete and imitations of wealth. Later, when Silas enters the home and is introduced to those in attendance, he addresses them by saying \"what name?\" because he heard \"a great man\" once say the same thing . At the table, too, he does \"only what the others ,\" and accepts all food and drink that is offered to him . The idea of mimicry versus legitimate or original action is even, fittingly, discussed at the table itself. When Bromfield Corey turns the discussion towards the hollowness of painting as an enterprise when compared to architecture, he frames this as a comparison between a mimetic art and a creative one: \"you architects and the musicians are the true and only artistic creators. All the rest of us, sculptors, painters, novelists, and tailors, deal with forms that we have before us; we try to imitate, we try to represent\" . This framing of painting as a weaker art form notably provides one reason that the Coreys might look down so strongly on Silas' profession as vulgar. Additionally, Bromfield's bringing together of the theme of imitation--which, up to this point, has primarily been associated with both class and social decorum--and the idea of art develops over the following chapters, and this meeting thus deserves special attention. In particular, these themes develop in tandem as the guests at the dinner party move on to discuss Tears, Idle Tears, a popular contemporary novel about one woman's self-sacrifice so that the man she loves can be with another woman who also loves him. Tears, Idle Tears thus becomes a particularly important symbol in the novel because it both introduces a larger discussion about the nature of reality and fiction as well as serves as a touchpoint in Chapter 19's meeting between Tom Corey and Penelope Lapham. To speak to the former point, Reverend Sewell's comment that \"The novelists might be the greatest possible help to us if they painted life as it is, and human feelings in their true proportion and relation\" is a bold statement advocating for the advancement of Literary Realism, which Howells himself championed . The argument presented at the table suggests that Romantic novels and literature go too far in glorifying both unrealistic struggles as well as loving relationships. If, in Romantic and Baroque novels, love is given \"divine honors,\" Sewell and others believe that love should be demystified and treated as \"natural and mortal\" . This idea that literature can serve as the place where reality is presented instructionally, rather than made colossal and unrealizable, also has profound implications for the novel's ongoing discussions of class and status. What is the world of high society, for example, besides an unrealistic fantasy world? And is the gap between mainstream society and high society in Gilded Age America not the same gap that Irene fails to overcome with Tom Corey, particularly in the realm of their literary and aesthetic knowledge? Finally, Silas' reliance on the Beacon Street house to serve as his introduction to the manners and particularly aesthetics of genteel Boston also directly and symbolically connects the world of manners to an unreal world of aesthetics, far away from the utilitarian world in which Silas was born and raised. This is the very reason he fails to convey his own experiences of poverty when they come up at the table: the Coreys' dining room is simply another world . This discussion also is furthered when Penelope herself brings up Tears, Idle Tears. It would seem that she and Tom, in representing a possible liminal or transitional state between high society and common society, also represent an interesting boundary between the fictional world of Tears, Idle Tears and the \"real\" world of their own lives in Howells' imagination. This is a complex point, but it is one served well by examples. Before we even are told explicitly that Penelope is reading Tears, Idle Tears in Chapter 19, we are given a hint that this is so in Chapter 17: \"I've read of cases where a girl gives up the man that loves her so as to make some other girl happy that the man does not love\" . As we come to learn, this is the exact plot of Tears, Idle Tears, and Penelope's desire to adopt the strategies of this novel into her real life shows just one example of how Penelope's attitudes and behavior seek to link reality and fiction. Importantly, this is also inherently a mimetic or imitative tendency that she displays. On the other hand, Tom Corey's treatment of Tears, Idle Tears comes down on exactly the opposite point--that is, that reality and fiction are linked but ought to be divorced from one another. At the conclusion of Chapter 19, Tom tells Penelope as much directly: \"you were talking of that book; and you said it was foolish and wicked to do as that girl did. Why is it different with you, except that you give me nothing, and can never give me anything when you take yourself away?\" . Tom also believes that the fictional world of Tears, Idle Tears is related to his reality, but he wants to pull Penelope away from the lessons of that novel and towards acting with common sense. Both Tom and Penelope are transitional figures between reality and fiction, and importantly, they also serve as transitional figures between common society and genteel society. Their eventual marriage thus is symbolic and evocative of America's future--one that links common and aristocratic life--as well as America's literature--accepting the lessons of literature and using them to represent reality faithfully. Finally, another meeting point between these themes, particularly as applied to a discussion of status, is in these chapters' treatment of the public and the private. Bromfield Corey's idea of opening vacant aristocratic homes to the poor, for example, seeks to open the private world to the public . The gossip at the table that later appalls Silas also has this tendency of making private matters public . Also at the Coreys' dinner, Silas' oversharing of his own experiences and his braggadocio regarding his new home and its finishes also show an impulse to take private matters and improperly make them public. This impulse is only added to by Silas' self-effacing confessions and apologies to Tom in Chapter 15. These actions all carry the flavor of Silas' earlier attitudes towards the Events, the newspaper that he feels represented him and his biography unfairly. At the same time as much private detail is inappropriately made public, however, a great deal of private information is rightfully exposed in these chapters. Most importantly, this includes Penelope's self-exposure and realization that she may have been trying to attract Tom from the very beginning. It includes Irene's gifting of all Tom's souvenirs to Penelope, which unmasks the depths of Irene's fantasy and obsession over Tom. It includes the Laphams going to Reverend Sewell in Chapter 18 and seeking the advice that will eventually bring Penelope and Tom together. It includes Penelope's revelation to Tom in Chapter 19 that the Laphams all thought Tom to be interested in Irene. Finally, it includes Tom's more detailed confession of love to Penelope, which explains the Stanton farm pamphlet from earlier, among other things. This association between things wrongly made public and high society--as well as the association between things properly made public and a more nuanced interaction of the classes--is no accident on Howells' part. After all, a great deal of misfortune in the novel might have been avoided if only the characters had chosen to speak up earlier or be honest with each other. This is an important idea to keep in mind towards the novel's close as we continue to learn more about Silas' business with Mr. Rogers and Zerilla Dewey, the relationship between the Coreys and the Laphams, and Silas' eventual relapse back to common society. Howells' critique of Gilded Age society and manners is strongest here, after the turning point and catalyst of the Coreys' dinner, and our attention should also correspondingly strengthen."}
