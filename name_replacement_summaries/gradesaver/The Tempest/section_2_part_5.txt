In act 2, he spoke very little, and when he did, was very curt and brief in his replies. In lines 95 to 102, Alonso speaks of \"the thunder, that deep and dreadful organ-pipeit did bass my trespass,\" and makes a story of the winds and waters causing sounds that reminded him of his guilt. The visual and sound imagery is very poetic and learned, and far more emotionally involved than Alonso's previous, clipped responses", "analysis": ""}
