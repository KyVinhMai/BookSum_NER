Even so, Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher, who usually went food shopping, had to shop at different stores to keep from raising suspicion or envy of their relative wealth. Before they go shopping, they staunchly pronounce themselves English citizens loyal to the King. Once Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher have departed, four men pound on the door and re-arrest Charles Darnay without giving any reason. They say that he has been denounced by Saint Antoine, specifically by Madame and Monsieur Defarge, as well as one other person", "analysis": "As Darnay travels through France, however, he recreates the journey to prison that Dr. Manette made long ago. Through this journey the reader receives a wider view of how the Revolution has affected society as a whole.  The bloodthirstiness of the people has become routine, and it does not even need to be stirred up by a mob.  Moreover, Darnay's escorts are irresponsible, and one of them is an alcoholic. Eventually he is thrown in prison, and soon after into solitary confinement, just as Dr. Manette was. All this happens without explanation. Thus Dickens is able to show the image of Darnay, in the same situation as Dr. Manette, pacing and saying, \"He made shoes.\" The two central themes of this chapter are reversals and death.  The incarceration of aristocrats has become so common that no one in the street even notices Darnay being conducted to jail; it is as normal for an aristocrat to go to prison as it is for a laborer to go to work.  Although Darnay has an understandable fear of the sort of characters he might find in prison, the refined members of society are jailed by coarse and vulgar men, rather than the other way around.  Death is omnipresent in French society, and Dickens describes the imprisoned gentlemen as ghosts.  The French Revolution has killed off the traits that were admirable in the French people, and the prison is filled with ghosts of beauty, stateliness, pride, and so on.  Their jailors are also associated with death, but of a less attractive type.  Their puffy faces recall victims of drowning. By Chapter 2, the force of the mob is revealed as even more terrifying.  Whereas Dickens formerly compared them to the natural forces of fire and water, they are now depicted in terms of savagery.  Their thirst for blood dehumanizes them, and false mustaches and eyebrows stuck on their faces hide their identities so that they can kill with impunity.  The crowd is \"awry with howling\" and seems bestial in its rage.  The transgressive and hedonistic nature of the mob is illustrated not only in that the people's faces are smeared in sweat, blood, and wine, but also in that the men wear women's lace, silk, and ribbon on their clothing.  The image of blood on stone is consistent throughout the novel in its association with the violence in France; the blood spattered on the grindstone connects this scene to the spilled wine on the cobblestones of Saint Antoine, as well as to the murder of Monseigneur . The position of the Manettes and Darnay in revolutionary France is complicated.  Despite the fact that they all reside in England, they are all French, and as such they are not as clearly opposed to the Revolution as most emigrants are.  Doctor Manette and Darnay have the most torn sympathies, with Manette angry at the aristocratic regime that imprisoned him but horrified at the excesses of the revolutionaries, and with Darnay concerned about the oppression that the peasants underwent but in fear for his life, being ultimately of the aristocratic class. A threatening shadow in Chapter 3 is thrown by Madame Defarge, who only becomes more terrible as the novel continues.  Her incitement of her husband to violence in previous chapters has given her the awfulness of Lady Macbeth, and her actions in Chapter 3 remain ominous.  She interrupts her knitting to point a needle at little Lucie \"as if it were the finger of Fate.\"  Her sternness, combined with the fact that the Fates had the power to cut a life short if they wanted to, does not bode well for little Lucie. Lucie is set directly into opposition with Madame Defarge for the first time in this chapter, and the contrast is described in terms of dark and light.  Madame Defarge has dark, glistening hair emblematic of her dark nature, whereas Lucie is still the \"golden thread,\" in her hair color and her sentimental, moral goodness. The darkness of Madame Defarge's nature is extended as a threat in this chapter when she stands over little Lucie, throwing a shadow over her.  Recognizing the threat to her child, Lucie kneels next to little Lucie to protect her, which throws darkness over both of them.  Madame Defarge seems to win the battle, at least in this chapter, because her darkness overwhelms their light.  Lucie tries to appeal to Madame Defarge's femininity, highlighting the supposed bond between them on this count by calling her \"sister-woman.\"  But Madame Defarge has been dehumanized and dismisses these claims, always arguing that class struggle is more important than an individual's suffering. The theme of resurrection is raised once again in Chapter 4.  The Doctor's newfound power is an affirmation of his full resurrection.  The power of resurrection is depicted as something transferable, and Doctor Manette hopes to use his own resurrection to affect that of his son-in-law. Now the role reversal of Dr. Manette and the Darnays is complete. This time, Dr. Manette must protect the prisoner and his family, when Lucie once protected the prisoner. In his power as temporary head of the family, Dr. Manette must protect Lucie, but he also does it to repay Lucie for her own loving care. In short, he is a new provider of magic: he protects Darnay and Lucie, and he motivates the mobs to peace. He has done precisely what the weak Darnay wanted to do, but could not. The defining characteristic of the post-revolutionary society is its backwardness, demonstrated by the fact that criminals jail virtuous men rather than the other way around, the opposite of the storming of the Bastille.  The inversions are evident in other aspects of the Manettes' experience in Paris.  For example, the Doctor's imprisonment, which had previously been a source of darkness and shame, becomes the primary source of his pride and power.  The very conception of resurrection is turned on its head in this chapter, with the description of the guillotine as \"the sign of the regeneration of the human race.\"  Dickens's ironic tone in describing a killing machine as a source of resurrection is made more biting by the fact that this was a common belief among revolutionaries, who wore miniatures of it on necklaces in place of a cross. Dickens disapproves of this use of religious imagery in the secular French Republic.  Describing the guillotine he writes: \"The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder.\"  The executioner was known as \"Samson\" after the strong man in the Bible.  The French Samson's blindness indicates that his work is counterproductive compared with what is intended by God.  He also refers to the guillotine as the \"National Razor which shaved close,\" punning on the part of the story of Samson in which he takes revenge on the Philistines for blinding him after a betraying woman named Delilah cut his hair. In Chapter 5, the Carmagnole was a dance specific to revolutionary France.  It was an equalizing and wild dance, executed in a circle with the combinations of dancers constantly changing. The horror of the French Revolution is not only evident in its violence, but also in the role reversals and transgressions that the revolutionaries engage in.  Dances tended to be organized in pairs, following a rigid pattern.  The revolutionaries smash these patterns, with men dancing with women, women with women, and men with men.  Dickens is more repelled by this sort of savagery than of an originally savage society, calling the dance a \"fallen sport.\"  It is repulsive to him because it represents the breakdown of an order that existed, rather than the absence of order to begin with. The mender of roads has now transformed into a completely different person, the wood-sawyer. He has fully adopted the revolutionary fervor and has changed professions to prove it. One he fixed things that brought people together as the road-mender; now he kills and divides as the wood-sawyer. Lucie's weakness in such a violent world is brought home to her in the wood-sawyer's metaphor of cutting the family. Although the wood-sawyer has a lot of influence in the mob, there is still one larger than him - Madame Defarge, who walks by quietly, casting shadows. The court scene in chapter 6 is one of the many manifestations of Dickens's dread of the power of mobs.  Although the trial is ostensibly run by the president, it is really the reaction of the crowd to the trial that decides the result.  When Darnay asks if it is a crime to hazard his life to save another French citizen, the populace shouts \"no\" and refuses to be silenced by the president's bell, continuing to shout until the shouting dies out of its own accord.  The danger of this power is in the fickle nature of the crowd, who call for blood one moment and in the next moment cry in sympathy with the prisoner. In this upside-down society, triumph is uncomfortably akin to its opposite.  The mob descends on Darnay when he is acquitted in the exact same way that they would have if he had been condemned, with only slightly different results.  The pike-decorated chair that the crowd places Darnay on seems more ominous than celebratory.  The knowledge that the same crowd could just as easily decide to tear him to pieces almost makes Darnay faint, and the triumphal procession back to his home is so similar to the procession to the guillotine that Darnay has to remind himself which one he is involved in. The connections between this trial and Darnay's trial in England are clear. As in England, Darnay's trial in France is also of treason - a class treason, of being a noble when all others are poor and equal. Being a man of two nations has troubled him in both trials - in England because of his French roots, and in France because of his years in England. In both trials, he was captured because he went on errands to save the family honor. Fortunately, this trial resembles the English trial in his triumphant departure on the arms of the wild crowd. In this third mob scene, the crowd that would have killed him now carries him home. Dickens repeats \"I have saved him,\" the last line of Chapter 6, as the first line of Chapter 7.  To the readers of his serialized novel, it would have been a foreboding last line. The cliffhanger at the end of this chapter is the mystery of who the third person to denounce Darnay is. Miss Pross's pledge of allegiance to the King  before she exits the shop is drawn directly from \"God Save the King\" or \"God Save the Queen\" , a British patriotic anthem. Before the Defarges enter, Lucie thinks that she hears footsteps on the stairs.  This again ties the Defarges' malevolent intervention into her life with her previous fears of the echoing footsteps in her London home.  Her earlier fancy that the footsteps that echo outside her house portended people coming to interfere in her life now comes true."}
