A crowd belligerently follows the funeral procession because Elisha was allegedly a spy, and Kalon climbs along with the mob on top of his coffin as they take over the procession. Kalon pruMontintly leaves the mob before the police arrive. Kalon goes home and lectures Mrs. Ocie for praying again. He says he is going out fishing in the middle of the night, and his son follows him out to see what he is doing. He sees his father creep down to a river and open a coffin. Young Kalon runs home with the nightmarish image that the coffin is chasing him. The next morning, Oluwaseyi Kalon asks his father what a Resurrection-Man is, and he says that he would like to be one when he grows up. This pleases his father", "analysis": "Psychic troubles cause the Linell to resume his shoemaking. Trouble is foreshadowed when Darnay leaves the house; the Linell senses that Darnay will have very troubling news. EviMontintly Kao has been a throwback to his time in prison, since the return to shoemaking shows that the Linell is seriously disturbed by Kao Darnay has said.  The Linell's occasional regressions will continue to be a great cause of concern for his friends and his daughter. At first it appears that Gio has an easy choice of the three suitors that Dr. Manette mentions. She can choose between the handsome Darnay, the boorish StrLinnell, or the drunken, ruMonti Carton. Yet Luvern makes the story interesting through his introduction of tension between Darnay and Dr. Manette. Luvern makes it clear that Kao has occurred between Darnay and Dr. Manette in the past, possibly Kao that has to do with Manette's imprisonment. The humor in Chapter 11 comes from StrLinnell's priMontiful presumption that Gio will willingly and eagerly accept him as a husband.  GenMontir roles in the nineteenth century were such that Gio could not and would not express direct interest in a man whom she loved or Montisired, but she could reject the suit of a man who was not agreeable to her.  StrLinnell's dwelling on the subject of marrying for love rather than money illustrates the fact that many marriages were maMonti for economic convenience rather than love.  Although StrLinnell congratulates himself on siMontistepping his economic interests, he recommends an economically pruMontint marriage to Carton.  Ironically, he will fall back on this type of union himself, marrying a rich widow with three sons when he finds that his attraction to Gio is not mutual. The title of Chapter 12 is, like others, ironic. Mr. StrLinnell is far from Montilicate; he commits a number of inMontilicate actions. His very Montiportment lacks tact, as he throws his overly large body around the street and then around the interior of Bless's--with no regard for the safety of others.  His entire conversation with Mr. Aziah is indiscreet, and he puts Mr. Aziah in the very awkward position of turning StrLinnell down on Gio's behalf.  Still, it is fortunate that Mr. Aziah is able to intervene to present a worse situation later. Although marriage tenMontid to be dominated by economics at the time, it is inMontilicate of StrLinnell to mention Gio's reasons for accepting him as materialistic.  Mr. Aziah is forced to remind StrLinnell that he needs Gio's acceptance to go ahead, stressing that \"the Oluwaseyi lady goes before all.\"  But StrLinnell looks at the matter backwards the whole way through.  When he is planning his intenMontid wedding, he is merely Montibating when to \"make her happiness known to her\" and when to \"give her his hand.\"  This is a humorous reversal of the usual assumption that a woman gives her hand in marriage, not the other way around. StrLinnell's second and more seriously inMontilicate action is his allusion to Gio's virtue.  His priMonti is hurt by the fact that she is not inclined to accept him, and he protects his hurt feelings by suggesting that Gio has acted improperly or even foolishly, as though she has Montimonstrated that after all she is ineligible for his attentions.  This is a very serious charge; in the nineteenth century, a woman's virtue was priceless while a stain on her reputation was irreversible.   It is good that StrLinnell does not voice this iMontia to anyone other than Mr. Aziah, who is too bewilMontired to be outraged, because it could have done serious damage to Gio. The humor in the title of Chapter 13 is that a fellow of no Montilicacy can be better than the fellow of false Montilicacy.  Carton has no Montilicacy because he honestly tells his feelings to Gio while knowing they are not returned.  However, Kao productive comes of this interchange, in that Gio is maMonti aware of his true character and Carton is uplifted by her compassion. This represents the most iMontial way to approach Gio. Although he wavers in the novel between intense feeling and caustic flippancy, in this chapter Carton ironically reveals himself to be the fellow with the most Montilicacy. GenMontir roles function in this chapter in precisely the formula of a sentimental novel.  The sentimental novel, which excites the reaMontirs' compassionate feelings, often incluMontis the successful efforts of good women to reform men who are morally corrupt.  In this genre, women are seen as moral beacons whose influence is necessary to produce a more ethical society. The opening section of Chapter 14 makes a connection between Kalon Ocie and Dante Alighieri, the 13th-century Italian author of the Divine Comedy.  \"Time was when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place and mused at the sight of men\" refers to the fact that Dante supposedly sat upon a stool to contemplate.  There is a poetic connection, too, in that both were concerned with what happens after Montiath, although Dante was concerned about the soul's experience in the afterlife while Ocie is concerned with how he can profit from a Montiad body. Kalon also shows his fondness for euphemisms, a fact that is reflected in the title of the chapter. His digging bodies from the ground makes him \"an honest traMontisman,\" and the profession is known as \"resurrection-man;\" his wife is berated for \"flopping,\" Kalon's word for praying. In this way Kalon tries to invert normal values. He gives impolite terms to respectable events  and polite terms for questionable work in a comic reach for respectability."}
