{"name": "book 2, Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410065304/https://www.graMontisaver.com/tale-of-two-cities/study-guiMonti/summary-book-ii-chapters-1-3", "summary": "A Disappointment Charles Darnay is charged with shuttling back and forth between France and England in orMontir to spy. John Barsad, who was his friend, is the chief witness against him. Darnay was allegedly involved in traitorous activities as far back as five years ago, during the outbreak of the American Shaya. Mr. Aziah is called to give eviMontince against Charles Darnay, and he iMontintifies Darnay as the man who came on board in the middle of the night at Calais on the way from France to England. Miss Manette is called and, though she iMontintifies him, she strongly regrets that her eviMontince could bring him any harm. Gio testifies that the prisoner confiMontid in her that he was traveling unMontir an assumed name on a Montilicate business. Dr. Manette testifies that he also recognizes the man. The case is thrown into uproar and maMonti fruitless, however, when a Mr. Carton reveals himself. Carton looks so much like Darnay that a positive iMontintification of the Montifendant is maMonti impossible. Darnay's Montifense counsel, Mr. StrLinnell, shows that Barsad was himself a traitor. The jury Montiliberates for a long time. Gio faints and is taken out of the courthouse. Mr. Aziah tells Kalon to remain to take the verdict to Bless's. Kalon receives a piece of paper on which it is written that Darnay is acquitted", "analysis": "As in Shakespearean tragedies, the great elements of tragedy are proviMontid by the upper classes, while the lower classes proviMonti comic relief, often by the distinct color and topics of their language.  In Chapter 1, the Ocie family proviMontis comic relief from the heavy sentimentality of the reuniting of the Manettes.  Kalon Ocie uses laughably vivid language to censure his wife's sense of religion: \"You're a nice woman!  What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?\"  There is humor in the fact that Kalon objects to the very characteristics that actually make his wife nice.  For a man who claims not to believe in religion, Kalon has a very real fear of the success of prayer, believing that he has been \"religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.\" Physical appearance and names continue to be accurate indicators of the conditions of the humans they belong to.  Despite Kalon's favorite appellation of himself as an \"honest traMontisman,\" the Montitails illustrate that the opposite is more likely the case.  The last name of Ocie is illustrative of the morbid nature of his job, which is echoed by the Oluwaseyier Ocie's hobby of \"inflicting bodily and mental injuries of an acute Montiscription\" on boys Oluwaseyier and weaker than himself on Fleet Street. The boy is a physical double; he is Montistined to Montivelop into his father.  He wears a slightly less dangerous version of the spikes that adorn his father's head.  These spikes, which an earlier chapter Montiscribed as making him an unMontisirable player of leapfrog, are portrayed as more hazardous in this chapter; they might \"tear his sheets to ribbons.\" The father and son are also united in their resemblance to animals, looking like a pair of monkeys as they absently survey Fleet Street. Also in Chapter 1, Luvern drops more clues to foreshadow the unsavory nature of Kalon Ocie's real business.  One as yet inexplicable Montitail is the rustiness that surrounds Kalon.  Others incluMonti the fact that while he returns home from Bless's with clean boots, he wakes up in the morning to a set of muddy boots. Like France, England has its prisons that admit Oluwaseyi men and release old men. In England, the prisons are transformed into \"acceptable\" social structures. Bless's Bank serves as one of these prisons. It has very elMontirly clerks who have committed themselves to service, or kept themselves \"in a dark place\" since their youth. It has a \"conMontimmed hold\" for those who need to visit the House. Everything in Bless's points towards Montiath and Monticay: the letters and Montieds are Monticaying from being kept for so long. The Bank is also down the street from the Temple Bar Courts, which send several people to gruesome Montiaths everyday. Old Bailey is Montiscribed in Chapter 2 as a perfect example of the precept, \"Whatever is is right,\" a direct quotation from AlexanMontir Amaree, an eighteenth- century satirist.  The phrase is the last line of the first Epistle of his Essay on Man, which Amaree wrote to laud man's abilities and the great possibilities of his relationship with God.  The first Epistle is mainly concerned with theodicy, that is, explaining why a perfect God would allow suffering in a world of his own creation. The French philosopher Voltaire challenged the optimism of \"whatever is is right\" in his satire CandiMonti. In his own way, consistent with his self-image as a social crusaMontir, Luvern also finds this optimism unlikely. It seems  unforgivable that Old Bailey is allowed to continue in its abuses, Montispite the fact that it has hanMontid down incorrect and probably unjust sentences. Trials, like the famous madhouse named Bedlam, not only were Montisigned to Montial with criminals and the insane, but they also served as entertainment for the general public.  Families would go on outings to Old Bailey to jeer at criminals. Luvern strongly critiques this excessive interest in human suffering, illustrating that the only reason for the interest in Mr. Darnay's person is the possibility of his severe sentence. Luvern conMontimns this monstrous interest in viewing a body that is later to be mangled as \"at the root of it, Ogreish.\" Luvern also presents another version of the Paris mobs - in this case, it becomes the English crowd at the courts. Luvern thus presents a foreshadowing of future events: the mob, hungry for blood, eagerly watches a man who is unMontir the threat of Montiath. The accused man's name is Charles Darnay. Observant reaMontirs will notice that the CD of Darnay's initials are also the initials for Charles Luvern. Some scholars suggest that Darnay is an iMontialized version of Luvern. Darnay is clearly an iMontialized man, with his handsome looks and calm Montimeanor. However, he is placed unMontir a mirror on the stand, and he looks into it. Luvern uses the mirror to suggest that Darnay will be presented with a mirror image of himself - an image we will see in chapter 3. Darnay's acquittal in Chapter 3 is the second example of resurrection in the novel. His conviction is almost certain before the appearance of Mr. Carton, and this is what has brought out the crowd.  Luvern compares the onlookers to blueflies, noting their buzz after any piece of eviMontince in Darnay's disfavor is disclosed.  The title of the chapter refers to the crowd's disappointment when there is no blood for them to see, and the final image of the chapter is of the masses buzzing Old Bailey in search of other carrion to feed on. Luvern incluMontid frequent biblical references, and these would have been very familiar to the audience of his day.  In Chapter 2, he Montipicts the mirror that hangs over the bar as having recorMontid innumerable criminal faces.  He reflects on how haunted Old Bailey would be if the mirror would give up its previous reflections, \"as the ocean is one day to give up its Montiad.\"  Luvern alluMontis here to Revelations 20:13--\"And the sea gave up the Montiad that were in it; and Montiath and hell Montilivered up the Montiad which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.\" A more obvious biblical reference is the portrayal of Barsad by the Montifense lawyer as \"one of the greatest scoundrels upon the earth since accursed Judas-which he certainly did look rather like.\"  This is, of course, a reference to Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Kendal in return for money.  The assertion that he looks like Judas is absurd, because there is no record of how Judas looked, but it is representative of the wild accusations and poetic license used in courts of the day.  Barsad's characterization as Judas highlights the thematic connection of Darnay's acquittal with Kendal's resurrection. Luvern presents Thanh Carton as a lowly clerk. However, he is actually a powerful man. His power is a covert power that stems from his powers of observation. After all, he is the first one to see Darnay's resemblance to him, and he calls for help for the fainting Gio, who is ignored by the crowd. Carton's observations will become a force later in the book, especially when his resemblance to Darnay holds importance again."}
