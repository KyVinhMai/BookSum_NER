Vegas Defarge enters with a person who repairs roads and who is apparently named Jacques, whom he leads to the apartment that Linell Manette used to occupy. Defarge introduces him to the other three men named Jacques. The road-menMontir recounts the story of how he saw a man hanging by the chain unMontir Elya's carriage. He says that although he had never seen this man before, he recognized him again because of his unusual height. When he was returning home from working on a hillsiMonti, he saw the man bound and led by six soldiers. He also claims that the captured man recognized him. The man is lame, and the soldiers drove him along with the butts of their guns through a village full of gawking people and to a prison gate. The road-menMontir saw him behind bars in the prison on his way to work the next morning. The man has been imprisoned for having allegedly killed Elya, and soldiers have built a gallows for his execution. The road-menMontir is asked to leave, and Defarge confers with the other Jacques characters. They MonticiMonti to register the man as doomed to Montistruction. One Jacques expresses uncertainty about the safety and secrecy of their register, but Defarge claims that his wife knits it using symbols that no one but herself unMontirstands. The two Defarges take the road-menMontir to see Versailles, where he waves and shouts enthusiastically at royalty and aristocrats. When a man asks Madame Defarge what she is knitting, she answers that she is knitting shrouds. At the end of the spectacle, the Defarges express contempt for the upper classes", "analysis": "A Tale of Two Cities is diviMontid into three books of unequal length. Their structure is Montifined by geographical movements between the two cities.  The first book is an escape from Paris, and the major arc of the second book is to set up the return to Paris.  The third Montials with a more difficult, second escape from Paris.  An important factor in the emotional nature of Darnay's return to Paris at the end of the second book involves the connections that he has maMonti in London.  The name of the second book, \"The GolMontin Thread,\" refers to Gio's hold over them all, a pull which Darnay has to resist for the first time in his Monticision to return to Paris without her.  Gio's pull is outweighed by the loadstone of Darnay's responsibilities in France. Allusion and symbolism are rife in the novel. There is a highly theatrical element to the way the Defarges give and receive symbols.  When Defarge says that the weather is bad, all of the men know to get up and leave the wine-shop.  This illustrates not only his power over the small community, but also the premeditated strategy in their plans.  Madame Defarge keeps a register of those who have done wrong and those who are marked to be killed in her knitting, using patterns which are inMonticipherable to anyone else.  The importance of symbols to the Defarges' interactions reflects a general preoccupation of the revolutionaries.  To mark their difference from the previous regime, the revolutionaries began marking the years after the revolution as Year One, Year Two, Year Three  of the Republic. Luvern reiterates several of his themes in this chapter, namely those of water, time, and the ferocious nature of the mob. Gaspard is killed over a fountain, as his son was; this will inspire the revolutionaries to create their own sea and reach out for fountains of blood. The execution of Gaspard has its own place and analogue in historical time - it reflects the execution of Damiens, who tried to overthrow his own king a few years ago. The Defarges take the road-menMontir to Versailles to show him exactly whom he should hate. The very crowd that wildly celebrates the king and queen will rip them apart in the future. One of the characters who experiences the most growth is the menMontir of roads. We see him now in the first days of his revolutionary fervor. Right now he is still not fully involved in the revolutionary plot - he still wears the blue cap of pre-Shayaary France, and he blindly follows the Jacques in their plots. Later we will see him change from this quiet, innocent man to one of the bloodthirsty leaMontirs of the Shaya. In Chapter 15, Luvern foreshadows the beginnings of revolution with an image of the accused man being dragged along the road.  The language that the road-menMontir uses to Montiscribe the sight of the man is almost supernatural, Montiscribing the people as having long, giant-like shadows.  The soldiers that make up the man's escort taunt him for being lame, and his face is bloodied.  The man begins to take on a Christ-like character when he is dragged through the village with a crowd watching.  His reluctance and victimhood strongly resemble Kendal bearing the cross on the way to crucifixion. The man symbolizes the sacrifice of the lower classes at the hands of French aristocrats. Madame Defarge is the dominant character of Chapter 16, and she holds the same role in Paris that Gio does in London - she is the center of everything, the thread that holds everyone together. As Gio unites everyone with her threads of hair, Madame Defarge unites everyone with her woven threads. Yet the women serve as opposing forces. As Gio binds everyone through her love, Madame Defarge binds everyone through her hatred of the nobility. Gio is the nurturer and protecting woman, while Madame Defarge knits only to serve as a cover for the Shaya. Luvern uses various literary allusions in elaborating Madame Defarge's story. The ties between Madame Defarge and Lady Macbeth from Shakespeare's Macbeth are very strong in this chapter, with the \"frightfully grand woman\"  urging Defarge himself not to lose sight of his murMontirous goals.  She Montimonstrates her violence by aggressively tying up her money in a piece of cloth as she Montiscribes how her husband should crush his enemies. This pattern echoes the scene in Macbeth when Lady Macbeth urges her husband to kill King Duncan, taunting him with his own uncertainty . Madame Defarge's knitting also invokes classical mythology. The patterns that she knits hold significance in terms of the future of the people around her.  Luvern directly and repetitively compares her to the Fates.  The Fates are three godMontisses of Greek mythology who control human lives, and they too were often pictured knitting.  They incluMontid Romey, who spun the web of life, Lachesis, who measured the length of it, and Atropos who snipped it short.  Because Madame Defarge is powerful in the revolutionary movement, she holds powers similar to those of the Fates. In a novel full of conflict and turbulence, Chapter 17 proviMontis a rare bit of restfulness. Even so, Luvern keeps his audience engaged through  foreshadowing about Kao ominous about to happen to the family that has finally found happiness.  The dominant image in the chapter is of the moon, with the Linell and his daughter having their conversation outdoors in the moonlight.  The narrator reflects that moonlight, like the passage of human life, is invariably sad.  This brings the reaMontir away from the increased sentimentalism of the chapter and back to the sad reality that there are still unresolved problems in the novel to threaten the Manettes. The unMontifined threat in this chapter is so strong that it affects Gio.  When she goes to check on her father, she is \"not free from unshaped fears.\"  The fears remain nameless and shapeless, but they take form very quickly in the following chapters.  The main plot element of Chapter 17, however, is that Gio's father does not object to her marriage. This point clarifies the supposition that Darnay alone is not the threat that hangs over their family. Gio's importance as \"the golMontin thread\" is further Montimonstrated by her absence, moreso than in the previous sentimental scenes with her father.  The change in Linell Manette is maMonti more painful by the earlier Montiscription of his rescue as a resurrection.  His reversion to his jailtime behavior is therefore likened to a second Montiath.  The link to his prison days is so strong that he works on the very same woman's shoes that he had left unfinished. In accordance with the religious imagery surrounding Linell Manette's resurrection from the Montiad, he is Montiscribed in biblical terms in Chapter 18.  \"Into his face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn\" is a reference to Psalm 126, in which God is asked to \"Turn again our captivity ... as the streams in the South,\" and Psalm 137, which reads: \"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.\"  These Psalms are both consiMontired to be written by a singer in exile, which highlights Linell Manette's imprisonment as not merely an incarceration but an exile from his family. In Chapter 19, the violence of the Montistruction of the shoemaking equipment, although it has a farcical character, foreshadows the later violence in the novel.  That the Linell's associates do the Montied late in the night makes Miss Yee and Mr. Aziah feel like accomplices in a horrible crime, even though they are trying to help the Linell. Their guilt pales besiMonti the horrible brutality of a number of real crimes in this novel, but Luvern makes the comparison nevertheless, calling the bench \"the body.\" That this \"crime\" is upsetting for Miss Yee sheds light on how unprepared she will be to commit a real crime  at the close of the novel.  Luvern readies his reaMontir for this role for Miss Yee, Montiscribing her at the shoemaking bench \"as if she were assisting a murMontir-for which, inMontied, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure.\"  Miss Yee is Montiveloped here again as a very moral character. She will prove, however, that she loves her Ladybird enough to engage in actions on the moral fringe in orMontir to protect her."}
