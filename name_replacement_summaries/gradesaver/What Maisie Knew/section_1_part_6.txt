{"name": "Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180325141142/http://www.gradesaver.com/what-maisie-knew/study-guide/summary-chapters-7-12", "summary": "Thinking of how Ida has said Maisie's father would rather be dead than have responsibility of her, Maisie thinks to herself that she has \"two fathers, two mothers and two homes, six protections in all\" and yet she doesn't \"know 'wherever' to go\". Ida and Sir Claude's relationship continues to worsen, and Ida has seemingly begun another affair with a man named Lord Eric. While Maisie, Mrs. Wix, and Sir Claude are spending time together one day, Mrs. Wix has the sudden idea that \"the right thing\" would be for the three of them go off to live together. Mrs. Wix threatens that this could happen anyway as a result of Ida leaving Sir Claude. Sir Claude says that people would talk badly if he leaves her rather than her leaving him. Mrs. Wix continues to press Sir Claude, saying that doing this would save him and that making Maisie his \"duty\" would \"repay a thousandfold\". Sir Claude eventually ends the conversation by saying that Mrs. Wix is being too dramatic but promising never to forsake them. After this conversation, nothing changes. Maisie becomes aware that Mrs. Wix's salary is not being paid, but Mrs. Wix is too polite to ask Sir Claude for it to be taken care of. He does have them sent a large cake and starts to take Maisie out more to parks, sports games, restaurants, shops, and the like. Ida, for her part, stays away from the house more and more, often for most of the week, as if practicing for \"a more considerable absence\"", "analysis": "James creates parallels through purposefully confusing names in this section and throughout the rest of the book. Specifically, he has Miss Overmore take on the name Mrs. Beale once she marries Beale Farange. This is confusing because Ida is still generally referred to as Mrs. Farange, the last name of her ex-husband and the name the reader might expect Miss Overmore to take after marriage. The women's uses of these names are revealing on a number of levels. Firstly, Ida keeping the last name Farange shows her continued connection to Beale Farange. As the narrator ironically states in the first chapter of the book, Ida and Beale were in a way more married after their divorce. Secondly, Miss Overmore taking the name Mrs. Beale rather than Mrs. Farange shows that she has a less deep connection with him, as a first name has more connection to one's surface identity while a last name connects to one's family and history. Finally, Mrs. Farange and Mrs. Beale having names that could cause the reader to confuse which character is which brings out parallels between the women, such as their scheming natures and lack of genuine care for Maisie. Sir Claude's photograph, which Mrs. Wix shows and eventually gives to Maisie, is an important symbol in the book. Upon seeing the photo, Maisie instantly adores the man. The fact that Maisie feels such fixation on the man from only his photograph might imply that her love for Sir Claude is superficial. However, others might think this is evidence of a connection so deep that it could be experienced immediately--like love at first sight. In addition, Mrs. Wix having to make the decision of whether to let Maisie keep the photograph foreshadows Mrs. Wix's love for Sir Claude and Maisie's need to choose between the two caretakers in the last chapters of the book. Maisie's education is an important theme in these chapters, particularly because it is so neglected at such an important time in her childhood. Once Miss Overmore marries Beale to become Mrs. Beale, she focuses more on her husband than her student-cum-step-daughter. The couple does purport to explore the idea of Maisie attending boarding school, but this never comes to fruition. When Maisie is returned to the care of Mrs. Wix at her mother's house, she and Mrs. Wix spend whole days studying to make up for lost time; however, it was stated upon the introduction of Mrs. Wix earlier in the book that the woman had little formal education herself and mostly \"taught\" Maisie through telling her stories. Maisie's lack of education throughout the book is tangible evidence of the negative effect of her upbringing. Just as the emotional neglect she has suffered will likely affect her ability to form stable relationships, her educational neglect could prevent her from understanding the world and supporting herself. The subject of Maisie's parents cheating on their new spouses finally becomes explicit in Chapter 11 when the character of Mr. Perriam is introduced. While Maisie's parents have both acquired new, younger spouses in the chapters leading up to this point, this has been done after they were divorced from one another, and only vague reference is made to social taboos they may have broken while married. With the introduction of Mr. Perriam, it becomes clear to the reader that Ida is an adulterer. A number of Ida's lovers will be introduced throughout the rest of the book, including Lord Eric, the Captain, and Mr. Tischbein; Beale also has at least one extramarital affair, with a woman named the Countess, while married to Mrs. Beale. While Mrs. Beale's reaction to Beale's adultery will be shown to be strongly negative, Sir Claude seems to be almost completely unfazed by Ida's, perhaps because of his guilt over his continuing relationship with Mrs. Beale. A thread of irony that runs throughout What Maisie Knew, but is is made explicit in Chapter 12, is the fact that Maisie has more parents and homes than a child usually would, and yet she feels alone and homeless. Maisie thinks to herself, \"With two fathers, two mothers and two homes, six protections in all, she shouldn't know 'wherever' to go\" . This paradox calls attention to the impact of Maisie's parents' actions and speech toward her; because they constantly fight over her custody, she does not feel a sense of love and stability."}
