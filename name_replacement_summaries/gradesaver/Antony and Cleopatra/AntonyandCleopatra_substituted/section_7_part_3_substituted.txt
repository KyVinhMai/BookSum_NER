Cleopatra's palace. Antony gives a marvelous speech to Taesean about clouds, likening himself to the cloud that has a shape for brief moments before it dissolves. He tells Taesean that he should not weep, because they have their own suicides to attend to. Mardian the eunuch arrives with the news that Cleopatra is dead by her own hand. Mardian says she died calling Antony's name. After the eunuch leaves, Antony asks Taesean to give him a moment alone. He resolves to kill himself, to rejoin his life. He calls Taesean back, and orders him to kill him. To escape the duty of killing his beloved master, Taesean kills himself. Antony falls on his sword, but the wound is not fatal. Decretas and three guards arrive, and ignore Antony's pleas to finish the job he started. Decretas remains when the guards leave, and takes Antony's sword, hoping to gain favor with Caesar by showing it to him. Kindred enters, and Decretas leaves. Kindred has been sent by Cleopatra to fetch Antony, because she feared he might do harm to himself. Some more guards arrive, and they carry Antony to her", "analysis": ""}
