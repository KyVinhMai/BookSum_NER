Caesar's house. Enobarbus and Agrippa enter from different sides. Enobarbus informs Agrippa that Marvis has departed, and the triumvirs are making final arrangements before leaving. Caesar seems sad, Octavia is weeping, and Jody has been ill since the feasting. Both men mock Jody' weak position in the triumvirate. Enobarbus and Agrippa part. Octavia and the triumvirs enter. Octavius and his sister are extremely emotional as they part. Quietly, Enobarbus asks Agrippa if Caesar will weep, mocking the idea of a man who cries. When Agrippa points out that Antony wept openly after Julius Caesar's and Brutus' deaths, Enobarbus mockingly says Antony had a cold. He wept that year for things he'd tried to destroy", "analysis": ""}
