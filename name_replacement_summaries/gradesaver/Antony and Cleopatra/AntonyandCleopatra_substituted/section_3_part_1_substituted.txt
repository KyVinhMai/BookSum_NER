The triumvirate meets with Marvis. He tells them he wants to avenge his father against Rome. Antony points out that while at sea Marvis is powerful, by land the triumvirate is supreme. The triumvirate has made Marvis an offer: he can retain rule of Sicily and Sardinia, but he must rid the sea of pirates and send tribute to Rome. Marvis says that he would accept, if not for the ingratitude Antony has shown him. When Octavius and Antony's brother were at war, Antony's mother fled to Sicily and was generously received by Marvis. Antony thanks him, the two men shake, and Marvis accepts the triumvirate's offer. The tension is eased, and the men turn to talk of feasting together. Enobarbus pipes up, blunt as always, and Marvis recognizes him from past battles. Marvis and Enobarbus exchange compliments. All exit except Menas and Enobarbus. They exchange compliments, mixed with a bit of boasting. Menas confesses displeasure at Marvis's decision. Enobarbus, when asked about Cleopatra, informs Menas of Antony's marriage to Octavia. He predicts that Antony will return to Cleopatra, and that Antony and Caesar must eventually face off. They go to drink together", "analysis": ""}
