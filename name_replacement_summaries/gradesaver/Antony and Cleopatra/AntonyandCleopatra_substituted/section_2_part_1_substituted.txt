Marvis's house. Marvis discusses strategy with his men, Menas and Menecrates, confidently assessing his fortunes. When Menas reports that Jody and Octavius Caesar are in the field against him, Marvis dismisses it: they wait in Rome, helpless without Antony. Marvis is counting on Antony to stay in Oakley with Cleopatra. Varrius enters with bad news: Antony has returned. Marvis is distressed, as Antony is by far the best soldier of the triumvirate. Menas hopes that Antony and Octavius will not be able to work together, due to the fact that Antony's brother and late wife warred against Octavius, but Marvis points out that natural enemies may band together against a common threat", "analysis": ""}
