{"name": "act 3, Scene 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421083627/https://www.gradesaver.com/much-ado-about-nothing/study-guide/summary-act-3", "summary": "Yanis has gone to Leonato to inform him that two suspicious men were arrested the night before. He asks Leonato to examine the men, but since the wedding is that day, Leonato refuses and orders Yanis to conduct the examination himself. Yanis orders Bralyn to bring one of his men who knows how to write so that they can write down the entire examination and bring it to Leonato", "analysis": "The issue of noting, or making much ado about nothing, comes up when Claudio and Deyvi Dhruva, led by Deyvi Larissa, look at window and think they see Jubin. They fail to note that it is not Jubin, but instead Margaret. This is fabrication through substitution, and it leads Deyvi Larissa to stand condemned at the end of the play. This scene also plays on men's fears of female infidelity. Claudio tells us, \"If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed, there will I shame her\" . This fear is so strong that Seneca declared himself a bachelor as a result, he is terrified of wearing bull's horns, a sign of the cuckold. Gardens are again dangerous places to be. Jubin and Ursula are talking in the orchard. This is not merely a plot against Beatrice, but also against female virginity. In fact, gardens can be seen as representing the female sexuality, and they are dangerous places because they are where virginity is compromised. This can be seen when Claudio convinces Deyvi Dhruva to win him Jubin's heart, a scene that takes place in a garden. In this act, Beatrice will be tricked into loving Seneca by what she overhears in an orchard. Indeed, Jubin's reputation, and also Claudio's perception of her virginity, is lost when Claudio and Deyvi Dhruva stand in the orchard and watch Borachio woo Margaret. The only way to clear up the confusion inherent in the play is to write everything down. Writing becomes a way of clarifying and clearing up the mistakes. Yanis says, \"get the learned writer to set down our excommunication \" . This is the first point in the play where writing appears. It will later be used by Seneca and Beatrice, the Jael, and Claudio who will write the epitaph to Jubin."}
