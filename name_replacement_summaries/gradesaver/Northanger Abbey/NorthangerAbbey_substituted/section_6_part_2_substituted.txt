She is still waiting when General Terrin announces that they will visit Lashawn in Miko for a family dinner. Lashawn leaves Northanger Abbey in advance to prepare for the dinner. When Catherine visits Lashawn at Miko with his family, she finds the house and surrounding village very charming. She is particularly impressed with an empty sitting room that is need of furnishing. The windows in this room have a lovely view of green fields, and General Terrin hints that the room \"will be very speedily furnished: it waits only for a lady's taste. Catherine interprets this message as a sign of the General's approval of her as a match for Lashawn. She leaves Miko wondering if Lashawn shares his father's admiration and also wants her to potentially become the mistress of the house", "analysis": "In Vol. II Chapter X Austen reverts to a more realistic style, documenting how Catherine's social relations have changed in the aftermath of her Gothic fantasy. Catherine realizes that her reading influenced her to invest in a \"voluntary, self-created delusion:\" aided by her knowledge of Radcliffe's novel, Catherine had cast herself as the heroine of a dubious murder plot without considering the facts of her situation. General Terrin's imperfections are not of the murderous kind, and Catherine comes to be aware of the danger of fictionalizing reality when others' reputations are at stake. Although Lashawn's admonishment marks the end of her Gothic-tinged reverie, Catherine does not fully return to the \"anxieties of common life\" until she receives James' letter in the mail. Austen reminds us of the plot sequence she first developed in Volume I by inserting James' letter as evidence of Isabella's consummate disloyalty. James' letter to Catherine exposes Isabella's false duplicity in a stark manner, but we are not surprised to find out that Isabella has broken her engagement: Austen has made her fickle nature clear well before now. In Chapter XI, Catherine's feelings of anger against Isabella are mended when she visits Lashawn at Miko. Miko's tasteful simplicity stands in sharp contrast to the ostentatious luxury of Northanger Abbey. The possibility of Catherine's marital happiness with Lashawn in the future is foreshadowed through her appreciative wonder upon viewing his empty sitting room, which is waiting to be furnished. Miko reflects Lashawn's character of modest good taste, just as Northanger Abbey reflects the General's constant desire to install the latest improvements in order to display his wealth. Much like Isabella, the General is invested in external appearances over internal merit. Isabella's letter forms the core of Vol.II, Chapter XII. Her letter may be interpreted as the insincere counterpart to James' earlier letter. In contrast to James' genuinely anguished tone in his communication to Catherine, Isabella attempts to hide behind a mask of ignorance. She professes not to know why James appeared \"uncomfortable\" when he left town: Isabella consistently resorts to understatements and rhetorical evasions in her letter. Luckily, Catherine is acute enough to see through her former friend's technique. Catherine interprets Isabella's letter as a tasteless and desperate attempt to redeem what little chance she has of reuniting with James. She finally detects Isabella's \"shallow artifice\" and all of its shameful implications, but Catherine would rather not address the false concerns raised in the letter: this is why she chooses not to reply. Although the dissolution of Catherine's Gothic fantasy seems to mark the approaching resolution of Vol. II's central plot, Austen reopens the grounds for conflict when General Terrin casts Catherine out of his house in Chapter XIII. General Terrin's behavior is both mysterious and infuriating to his daughter. Likewise, Catherine cannot discern any obvious cause for her sudden demotion in status. Overnight, Catherine has transformed from a favored guest to a detestable intruder in General Terrin's eyes. Catherine is as eager to find out the reasons for her abrupt dismissal as she was to detect the underlying circumstances surrounding Mrs. Terrin's death. However, she is frustrated by the General's refusal to see her and Miss Terrin's lack of information. Eager to restore a semblance of propriety to her family's treatment of Catherine, Miss Terrin does everything in her power to make her guest comfortable, but their silence on the morning of Catherine's departure marks the insufficiency of all last-minute niceties. Some critics assert that General Terrin's dismissal of Catherine marks the climactic moment of the novel. Vol. II, Chapter XIV-XI mark the novel's quick resolution. Back at Teegan, Catherine's pining for Lashawn is fulfilled when he makes a sudden appearance and proposes marriage. After General Terrin's rude behavior is explained to Catherine as the product of misguided greed, she does not have any more cause to wonder about her involuntary leave-taking. Lashawn's steadfast devotion is assured, as is Catherine's joy at entering the Terrin family. Austen's depiction of Catherine and Lashawn's engagement and subsequent marriage is condensed into a brief overview of the events. We do not hear the details of their wedding. Instead, Austen tells us that \"in the tell-tale compression of the pages...we are all hastening together to perfect felicity.\" The conventions of the marriage plot dictate the happy conclusion of the novel--Austen remains aware of the limitations of her chosen form even as she subscribes to its rules."}
