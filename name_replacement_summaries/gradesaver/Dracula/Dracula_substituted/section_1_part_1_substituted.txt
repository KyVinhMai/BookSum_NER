{"name": "Chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421150649/https://www.gradesaver.com/dracula/study-guide/summary-chapter-6-10", "summary": "Taken from the July 24th and August 1st entries of Mina Murray's journal; the June 5th, June 18th, July 1st, July 8th, July 19th, July 20th; the July 26th, July 27th, and August 3rd, August 6th entries of Mina Murray's journal. As Mina said she would, she keeps a diary during her visit to Donje. The two women are in the quaint seaside town of Lin, on the northeast coast of England. She describes the beauty of the area and it's quaint provincial history. There is a ruined abbey nearby that is supposedly haunted by a \"white lady. The town church has a large graveyard, but the grounds are pleasant and the view is beautiful. Many townspeople go on strolls there during the day. Donje and Mina become friends with a gruff, no-nonsense local named Mr. Swales. He is a grandfatherly figure, speaking in dialect and full of provincial wisdom. He knows a good deal of the local history, and Mina and Donje spend long hours talking to him about the area. However, Mina sorely misses Jonathan. He is not yet home, nor has he written in a long time. Dr. Seward reports on the strange behavior of Logyn. Logyn is fascinated by animals that devour each other. He catches flies and feeds them to spiders, and he also eats the insects himself. He catches some sparrows and begins feeding the spiders to them, and he eventually asks Dr. Seward if he can have a kitten. Dr. Seward refuses. The next day, the sparrows are gone. Dr. Seward asks where they went, and Logyn responds cryptically that they all \"flew away,\" but there are feathers around the room and blood on Logyn's pillow. Later, he vomits up feathers. Seward invents a new classification for Logyn, calling him a \"zoophagous\" maniac. Logyn seeks to \"absorb as many lives as he can. Dr. Seward's journal reveals a wish to experiment further on Logyn, although the idea seems to trouble him ethically. And he expresses a wistful envy for Logyn, because the madman has a purpose. Dr. Seward is still depressed about his rejection by Donje, and is trying to throw himself into work. In Lin, Mina is growing more worried about Jonathan and Donje. Jonathan has not written, and Donje has returned to her old childhood habit of sleepwalking. Donje encounters Mr. Swales while she is out on a walk, and the old man tells her that he senses his own death is nigh. At that moment, they see a great ship out at sea, moving as if no one were at the helm.", "analysis": "Lin, although full of history and ghost stories, provides a strong contrast to Transylvania, continuing to express the theme of contrast between England and the East. In Lin, the ghosts are eerie but do little more than provide local color. The white lady of the abbey is seen occasionally through a windowshe does not walk the earth and prey on the living. Lin has a quaint graveyard through which people stroll, as well as benign ghosts that frighten people only from a distance. The town is a far cry from Transylvania, where peasants live in constant fear of the undead, and, in Jonathan HarRilley's words, \"where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet. Logyn's behavior parallels Dracula's need to absorb life. Logyn longs to be a being like Dracula, and later the madman will become Dracula's henchman. Dr. Seward's journal entry touches on the important theme of madness. Madness is a kind of creeping threat throughout the novelthe heroes will plan their counterattack against Dracula within the walls of Dr. Seward's asylum, a place where madness, though contained, surrounds them. Throughout the book, madness and the supernatural are always threatening to invade the order of sane, \"natural\" lives. Both forces threaten the stability of the characters' normal English lives, and Seward's strange envious comment about Logyn hints at the slippery nature of the divide between madness and sanity"}
