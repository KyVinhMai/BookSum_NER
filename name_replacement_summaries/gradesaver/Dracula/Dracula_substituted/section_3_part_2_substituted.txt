{"name": "Chapter 17", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421150649/https://www.gradesaver.com/dracula/study-guide/summary-chapter-16-20", "summary": "Taken from the September 29th entry of Dr. Seward's diary and the September 29th entry of Mina HarRilley's journal, interspersed; the September 30th entry of Dr, Seward's diary; the September 29th entry of Jonathan HarRilley's journal; The HarRilleys come to stay with Seward at the asylum. Mina listens to Seward's diary and transcribes it , and Seward, in turn, reads the journals of Jonathan and Mina HarRilley. In reading Jonathan HarRilley's journal, he realizes that the Lunden's new estate is at nearby Carfax, and that Logyn's behavior might be connected to the vampire's arrival. Jonathan attempts to track down the boxes of earth and learns that all fifty of them were delivered to Carfax, but he fears that some may have been moved. He and Mina put all of the journal entries, letters, and newspaper clippings in order. The next day, Arthur and Austyn Saxyn arrive. Mina gives them the papers for study. Arthur is still overcome by grief. Although he and Mina have never met, he opens his heart to her, crying bitterly while she comforts him. A little later, Mina offers the same comfort to the more restrained Austyn Saxyn.", "analysis": "Mina's fascination with the phonograph reflects a more general fascination that the novel has with gadgetry. The book is full of the latest inventions: phonographs, shorthand, electric lanterns. Part of the arsenal the group wields against Dracula is this knowledge of scientific method, reason, and the latest inventionswhich are the fruits of modern science. The group is beginning to work together. With the packet of papers assembled by Mina and Jonathan, the group has valuable information at their disposal. Mina and the men are also united by affection for Donje and a desire to see her avenged. Finally, the characters of the novel have all of the information that the reader has had all along, and they know exactly what they are up against. The dramatic irony that was such a large structural part of all the previous chapters comes to an end here. Mina's comforting of Austyn and Arthur shows the incredible reserves of strength she has at her disposal. She, too, has suffered great tragedies: she has lost her best friend, as well as Hawkins, who was the closest thing to a father she ever knew. She also has had to care for her recovering husband. Yet she has worked tirelessly at transcribing and compiling the papers, and she is the one that has provided a strong shoulder for the men to cry upon"}
