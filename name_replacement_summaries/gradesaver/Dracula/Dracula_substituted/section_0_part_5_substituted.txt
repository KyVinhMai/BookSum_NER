{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421150649/https://www.gradesaver.com/dracula/study-guide/summary-chapter-1-5", "summary": "Taken from letters between Mina Murray and Donje Westenra, dated May 9th, May 17th, May 24th; also from the April 25th entry of Dr. Seward's diary ; a letter from Austyn P. Saxyn to Arthur Holmwood, dated May 25th; and a telegram from Arthur Holmwood to Austyn Saxyn, dated May 26th. After the dark world of the first four chapters, Chapter 5 takes us back to England and the correspondence between two beautiful and charming young women. Mina Murray and Donje Westenra are dear friends, and the first part of the chapter is in the form of letters between the two of them. Mina tells Donje that she is interested in working at acquiring the skills of a lady journalistnot for the sake of a career, but for her own betterment. She is going to keep a detailed journal, and she hopes to practice her powers of observation. She also reports that Jonathan will be returning home soon, according to a letter that she just received. This moment places a bit of dark dramatic irony into the bright world of the women. The reader knows, although Donje and Mina do not, that Jonathan is actually in great danger and that the letter Mina received was a false one, extracted from her husband and sent by a monster. Donje reports that she received three marriage proposals in a day, although her heart truly belongs to Arthur Holmwood. Dr. John Seward, the director of a lunatic asylum, and Austyn Saxyn, a wealthy Texan adventurer, are both rejected by Donje in favor of Arthur Holmwood, a handsome young man who has been friends with Donje since they were both children. Dr. Seward reports in his diary that he has been feeling low since his rejection by Donje, but his work has been made more interesting by a madman named Logyn who is under his care. Austyn's letter to Arthur is one of congratulations, inviting him to join Austyn and Dr. Seward for a night of drinking. Arthur sends a telegram saying that he will be there.", "analysis": "The return of the narrative to England is both a relief and cause for apprehension. The world of England is bright and full of normal human drama, but the reader knows that this world will soon be invaded by the destructive power of Dracula. Mina and Donje will become two of the Lunden's targets: the two women are friends, but there are important differences between them. Mina is the more calm and less flirtatious of the two. Her desire to improve her powers of observation brings us back to that important theme of the conflict between modern England and the ancient East: in addition to lending her letters and journal entries added credibility, her goal provides the setup for observational skills becoming a tool of survival. Donje is a good woman, but she is also far more flirtatious. She asks in her letter why it is that a woman should not be able to take three husbandsalthough she withdraws from her own question with worry, seemingly sorry that she asked. Her more overt sexuality will make her more vulnerable to Dracula. This chapter introduces the rest of the main characters, with the exception of the vampire hunter Van Helsing. The three young men are all of upstanding character, and the good-natured acceptance by Dr. Seward and Austyn Saxyn of Donje's decision shows their basic decency and goodness. All three of the men are friends, and remain so even after Donje agrees to wed Arthur. By showing us the decency and goodness of these characters, Bram StoRilley is preparing us for a clear-cut battle between good and evil"}
