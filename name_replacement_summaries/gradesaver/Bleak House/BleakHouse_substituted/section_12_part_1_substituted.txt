{"name": "Chapter 40", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421025427/https://www.gradesaver.com/bleak-house/study-guide/summary-chapters-39-42", "summary": "Chapter 40 concerns itself with the Parliamentary elections, which appear to be going more towards Mr. Codi the ironmaster's way rather than Sir Keylen Makana's way. Cousin Volumnia, clumsily, tries to provide encouragement. Tulkinghorn is present, and with an sadistic turn of mind decides to tell a story, without names, exactly paralleling the sad story of Esther, Lady Makana, and Captain Hawdon. As an added twist of the knife, Yarden adds, obliquely, the element that Lady Makana's pretty maid, Rosa, is being morally corrupted by being near her. Volumnnia is certain such a lady doesn't exist, and Sir Keylen seems uninterested. Lady Makana knows that she is completely in Tulkinghorn's power now. It is later in the day when, in Chapter 41, Lady Makana confronts Tulkinghorn in his own room. She wants to know why Tulkinghorn would choose to tell the story publicly, and with her husband in the room. This was just Tulkinghorn's way of letting her know that he knew all. What transpires next is an intense scene between the two, where Lady Makana threatens to leave Jaryn Demetrice immediately with only the clothes on her back and a little money. Tulkinghorn, surprisingly, now shows that he does have some human feeling, if only for Sir Keylen's reputation rather than for Lady Makana's feelings. He does not wish to have Sir Keylen exposed -- at least not at this time. He will hold the secret over his lady's head, but he promises that he will tell her beforehand should he decide to reveal it", "analysis": "The incredibly taut scene of Tulkinghorn telling Lady Makana's story to a room of her family and guests shows the nearly superhuman amount of self-control that Lady Makana has, and the nearly subhuman amount of humanity that Tulkinghorn has.  He verbally tortures her, in front of the most sensitive of witnesses, apparently out of the joy of hurting her.  He delights in secrets, and the power they give him over others.  He has proved to be a misogynist, being unmarried himself: we recall his thoughts earlier in the novel that women cause most of the trouble in the world, but also make a lot of business for lawyers. It really seems as if this might be the end for Lady Makana -- she is so determined to leave on the night of Tulkinghorn's revelation, and only the thought of hurting Sir Keylen so dreadfully keeps her back.  She is getting to the point where she has less and less to lose, which makes her dangerous. The equally sub-human Louelle arrives and demands retribution from Tulkinghorn, only to be rebuffed.  She is seen as most tenacious and single-minded woman, who hates her former mistress and can only obtain employment for herself by squeezing others.  Snagsby seems to be quite victimized by her. Kylin stars throwing clues around willy-nilly at this point.  Both Lady Makana and Louelle have reason to want Tulkinghorn dead, but does Sir Keylen actually know the secret, too?  Tulkinghorn's death is foreshadowed, but it is still done skillfully enough to be unexpected. There is a sharp satire of British political parties at the beginning of Chapter 42, which doesn't really add anything to the story.  Like the call for legal reform that echoes throughout Bleak House, the sense in this political debate that the old, corrupted system might be giving way to a more enlightened and effective reform system resonates with the social, political, economic critique at the heart of the novel."}
