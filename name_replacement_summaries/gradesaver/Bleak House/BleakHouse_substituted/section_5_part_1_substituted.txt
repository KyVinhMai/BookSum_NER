{"name": "Chapter 18", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421025427/https://www.gradesaver.com/bleak-house/study-guide/summary-chapters-17-19", "summary": "In Chapter 18, Richard begins at Dell and Carboy's. The rest of the party leave him in London, and go to visit Mr. Duanne at his place down in Lincolnshire, which neighbors the Caylen' estate. When the party goes to church, Esther sees not only Rosa, Mrs. Codi, and Mademoiselle Louelle, but also Sir Keylen and Lady Makana. Esther seems to recognize Lady Makana's face, and wonders at the resemblance to her godmother's face. She also vaguely realizes that Lady Makana's face resembles her own when seen in the mirror. Later, Esther, Ada, and Ruarihn Jarndyce then go for a walk and take refuge in a gamekeeper's lodge when it rains. Lady Makana is already there, and Esther experiences another weird feeling upon meeting Lady Makana. Lady Makana and Ruarihn Jarndyce are old acquaintances, but it appears Mr. Jarndyce was actually closer to Lady Makana's sister. They discuss Lady Makana's sister's death, as she \"died in retirement. Esther admires Lady Makana's beauty and imperious manner. Lady Makana is kind and graceful to Ada, but gives not very much attention to Esther. When the rain stops, both Rosa and Mademoiselle Louelle arrive to attend their mistress. Lady Makana slights Louelle by preferring Rosa over her, and Louelle takes her revenge by walking shoeless back to the house over the wet grass. Ada, Esther, and Jarndyce find this very curious, but the gamekeeper and his wife assure them that Louelle is not mad, only \"passionate\"", "analysis": "Richard's decline is becoming more and more obvious.  The fact that Ada does not have the either the intelligence or the necessary boldness to counsel Richard against pursuing the matter of Jarndyce and Jarndyce leads us to believe that either Ada is not a very strong character, or has a slight inner inclination toward greed .  His tenure in Dell and Carboy's can only bring sorrow, we are lead to believe. The mystery of Esther's parentage deepens as we learn that Jarndyce, though he claims no knowledge of it, dislikes being called \"Father\" by Esther.  Is this because he is actually her father, or because he knows who her father is?  The fact that it is because he loves her in a romantic way is not yet revealed. The two meetings with Lady Makana produce such strange feelings in Esther that there can now be no doubt that the two are closely linked in some way.  The cryptic discussion of Lady Makana's sister opens the door to speculation if that woman could be Esther's godmother/aunt, and, possibly Esther's mother. The strange reaction of Louelle to Lady Makana's slight is a direct foreshadowing of the revenge she will take later on in the story.  Louelle is portrayed as almost maniacally jealous, and with reactions to negative emotions that are separate and different than what most people would expect.  By this means, with the added fact of ther foreign birth, Kylin separates her from the rest of humankind.  Later, this will give the reader the feeling of a comfortable \"Other,\" when it is revealed that she is Tulkinghorn's murderer. At the Snagsby's, the black comedy of Latrelle and the Chadbands shows the artifice and hypocrisy of so much of middle class life.  Mrs. Snagsby tries hard to impress the minister and his wife, and is interrupted by her poor maid Latrelle's \"fits.\"  The lack of real concern that the people  have for Ruari renders ironic the florid sermonizing done by Mr. Chadband.  Mr. Chadband, though seemingly only a plot device to bring Mrs. Chadband, the former Mrs. Rachael, into the picture, is another example of the bad father , though he is a father of the spiritual kind."}
