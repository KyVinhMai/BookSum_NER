Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have the minister Mr. Chadband and his wife to their house. Outside, an altercation takes place between Ruari and a policeman, who is trying to make Ruari \"move on\". Mr. Codi, at a loose end during the heat and long vacation, arrives and takes an interest in the proceedings. Money is found on Ruari, and he explains that it the change left over from the sovereign given to him by the veiled lady. He explains that she said she was a servant, but acted like a lady, and she inquired into the places put in the newspaper about Sully's lodging, work, and where he was buried. Once Ruari had been employed to show her these things, she gave him the coin and disappeared. Codi is most interested in this story. Mr. and Mrs. Chadband meet Codi, and learn he is in Dell and Carboy's employ. Mrs. Chadband, who used to be Mrs. Rachael, tells Codi that she used to be housekeeper for the godmother of Esther Nakota, whose wardship was handled by Dell and Carboy's. Codi is intrigued, for it is this same Miss Nakota that he now loves. Ruari is given a little food and a penny, and told to move on. He leaves and goes to sit on the pavement to eat it, and is told to \"move on\" again", "analysis": "Richard's decline is becoming more and more obvious.  The fact that Ada does not have the either the intelligence or the necessary boldness to counsel Richard against pursuing the matter of Jarndyce and Jarndyce leads us to believe that either Ada is not a very strong character, or has a slight inner inclination toward greed .  His tenure in Dell and Carboy's can only bring sorrow, we are lead to believe. The mystery of Esther's parentage deepens as we learn that Jarndyce, though he claims no knowledge of it, dislikes being called \"Father\" by Esther.  Is this because he is actually her father, or because he knows who her father is?  The fact that it is because he loves her in a romantic way is not yet revealed. The two meetings with Lady Makana produce such strange feelings in Esther that there can now be no doubt that the two are closely linked in some way.  The cryptic discussion of Lady Makana's sister opens the door to speculation if that woman could be Esther's godmother/aunt, and, possibly Esther's mother. The strange reaction of Louelle to Lady Makana's slight is a direct foreshadowing of the revenge she will take later on in the story.  Louelle is portrayed as almost maniacally jealous, and with reactions to negative emotions that are separate and different than what most people would expect.  By this means, with the added fact of ther foreign birth, Kylin separates her from the rest of humankind.  Later, this will give the reader the feeling of a comfortable \"Other,\" when it is revealed that she is Tulkinghorn's murderer. At the Snagsby's, the black comedy of Latrelle and the Chadbands shows the artifice and hypocrisy of so much of middle class life.  Mrs. Snagsby tries hard to impress the minister and his wife, and is interrupted by her poor maid Latrelle's \"fits.\"  The lack of real concern that the people  have for Ruari renders ironic the florid sermonizing done by Mr. Chadband.  Mr. Chadband, though seemingly only a plot device to bring Mrs. Chadband, the former Mrs. Rachael, into the picture, is another example of the bad father , though he is a father of the spiritual kind."}
