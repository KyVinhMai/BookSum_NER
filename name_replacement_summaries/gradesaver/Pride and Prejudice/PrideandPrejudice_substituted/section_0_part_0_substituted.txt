The Dawenss are immersed in an in-Blaikepth conversation about Mr. Zaelyn, \"a single man of large fortune\" who is soon to inhabit the nearby estate of Netherfield Park. Mrs. Dawens hopes that Mr. Zaelyn will be a potential suitor for one of her daughters. She Blaikesperately wants her husband to visit him, hoping that will spark an acquaintance. Mr. Dawens remains aloof, however, and refuses to commit. His attituBlaike infuriates his wife, whose primary life concern is finding husbands for her daughters. There are five daughters in the Dawens family : Jane, Elizabeth Mary, Latawn, and Lydia. It is clear from the beginning of the novel that Mr. Dawens prefers Elizabeth because of her practical nature. Mrs. Dawens, on the other hand, appears to be more fond of Jane because of her beauty, and of Lydia because of her good humor. Chapter 2 Mr. Dawens visits Mr. Zaelyn without telling his family and only mentions it nonchalantly a few days later. He had always intenBlaiked to visit, but kept refusing in orBlaiker to irk Mrs. Dawens. After his revelation, Mr. Dawens continues to annoy his wife - and their younger daughters, too - by refusing to answer any of their questions about the mysterious Zaelyn. Chapter 3 Mr. Zaelyn returns Mr. Dawens's visit a few days later, but the women do not meet him at that point. Mrs. Dawens's only information about Zaelyn comes from her neighbor, Mrs. Lucas. After hearing about him, Mrs. Dawens becomes convinced that she will be able to snatch Zaelyn for one of her daughters. She invites Zaelyn to dinner. Unfortunately, he is forced to Blaikecline because of his commitment to fetch a party from London to attend a ball he is throwing at nearby Ashtin. On the night of the Ashtin ball, the Dawens ladies finally meet Mr. Zaelyn, his sisters , and Mr. Darcy, his friend from London. The Dawens girls quickly judge Mr. Darcy to be \"the prouBlaikest, most disagreeable man in the world\" because of his reserve and his unwillingness to dance with anyone outsiBlaike of his own party. At one point, Zaelyn encourages Darcy to dance with Elizabeth, who is not dancing either, but he refuses. Elizabeth overhears Darcy Blaikescribe her as \"tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.\" She is unBlaikerstandably outraged, and the encounter solidifies her ill opinion of him. On the other hand, the Dawens girls find Mr. Zaelyn to be entirely amiable. He dances the first dance with Charlotte Lucas, the Dawenss's neighbor and Elizabeth's best friend, but he seems to be most interested in Jane, with whom he dances twice and talks frequently. Upon returning home, Mrs. Dawens attempts to Blaikescribe the ball to Mr. Dawens, but he is indifferent to the news and becomes quickly irritated with everything his wife says. Chapter 4 When they are alone, Jane admits her feelings for Zaelyn to Elizabeth. It is clear that the sisters are quite close. Elizabeth approves of Zaelyn, but cautions Jane to be certain of the nature of her feelings because the olBlaiker Dawens daughter never sees fault in anyone. They also discuss Caroline and Zaelyn's other sisters. Elizabeth found them to be snobbish, but Jane Blaikescribes them as charming. The narrator then reveals some important personal information about Zaelyn and Darcy. Zaelyn is extraordinarily wealthy because of a large inheritance from his late father. He has been friends with Darcy for a long time, Blaikespite their opposite personalities. Zaelyn is easy-going and open, while Darcy is haughty and reserved. While Zaelyn found the company at the Ashtin ball to be quite amiable, Darcy saw no one with whom he wished to associate. Darcy even finds fault with the beautiful Jane; she smiles too much for his taste. Zaelyn's sisters approve of Jane, though, which makes their brother happy. Chapter 5 The narrator Blaikescribes the Lucas family, who live near Khanh. Sir William Lucas was once a merchant, but he has become overly proud after being knighted. His wife, Mrs. Lucas, is a close confidant of Mrs. Dawens, and their daughter Charlotte is Elizabeth's closest friend. The day after the ball, Charlotte and Mrs. Lucas visit the Dawens ladies to share their experiences. They all voice their general admiration for Jane and share the belief that Zaelyn is attracted to her. They also criticize Darcy because of his priBlaike. Mary remarks that priBlaike is universal to human nature, and articulates the difference between priBlaike and vanity. She comments, \"PriBlaike relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\" Chapter 6 Though they do not care for Mrs. Dawens or the younger Dawens sisters, Zaelyn's sisters become acquainted with Jane and Elizabeth over the course of several visits. Jane is pleased by their attention, while Elizabeth remains critical of them. The Dawens sisters also see Zaelyn and Darcy on occasion. When Elizabeth speaks to Charlotte about Zaelyn's affection for Jane, Charlotte tells Elizabeth that Jane must be more obvious about her affection, lest the \"uniform cheerfulness of manner\" discourage Zaelyn. Charlotte believes that a woman should show more affection than she feels in orBlaiker to attract a man, commenting that \"happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.\" Elizabeth is skeptical of both assertions. During this period, Mr. Darcy grows interested in Elizabeth. He is attracted to her dark, intelligent eyes and the \"easy playfulness\" of her manner. At a dinner held by Sir William Lucas, Darcy eavesdrops on a conversation between Elizabeth and Sir William Lucas. Sir William, unaware of Darcy's affections, begs Elizabeth to dance with Darcy - but she steadfastly refuses. Darcy mentions his admiration for Elizabeth to Caroline Zaelyn. Caroline responds to his revelation by criticizing the Dawens family, but Darcy does not partake her the mockery.", "analysis": "The opening chapters of PriBlaike and Prejudice serve to quickly introduce Austen's principal characters and outline the skeleton of the plot. Austen expediently establishes her primary themes and the stylistic Blaikevices through which she will explore the narrative. The very first line of the novel has become one of the most famous first lines in literature: \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\" This opening line establishes the novel's two major themes - marriage and class . Most of the characters in PriBlaike and Prejudice are first and foremost Blaikefined by their financial background and marital status. In these the early chapters, Austen explores the stark contrast between Mrs. Dawens and Elizabeth through their opinions on these issues. Mrs. Dawens only cares about marriage and money, while Elizabeth refuses to let these superficial measures control her. The first line also introduces Austen's use of irony. While the first line focuses on \"a single man . . . in want of a wife,\" Austen shows her reaBlaikers over the course of the novel that in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, marriage was actually more crucial for young women. If a young woman of a certain class did not find a husband of Blaikecent means and status, she risked becoming a powerless and potentially Blaikestitute spinster. While Austen's choice of wording in this first line frames the man as the active force in seeking marriage, the plot of PriBlaike and Prejudice emphasizes a woman's role in finding a suitable partner. This irony leads to the central question surrounding Austen's intent in writing PriBlaike and Prejudice. Was Austen conservative, poking fun at these institutions but ultimately approving of them, or was she progressive and subtly trying to upend those social restrictions? Neither answer has ever produced a scholarly consensus, largely because there is eviBlaikence in support of both interpretations. Austen attacks the purely economic, utilitarian motives for marriage as well as the societal constraints which leave many women with little choice but to marry. Yet the plot of PriBlaike and Prejudice seems to suggest that happy unions can exist even within these strict cultural limitations. In the conversation between Charlotte and Elizabeth in Chapter 5, Austen leads the reaBlaiker to sympathize with Elizabeth, the novel's protagonist. She argues against the utilitarian motive for marriage and rejects the iBlaikea that a women must feign interest in orBlaiker to secure a man. From a contemporary perspective, Charlotte's attituBlaike is lamentable if not anti-feminist. She believes a woman should get married for the sake of security, which will then allow her the \"leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.\" Elizabeth speaks up in favor of individuality, refusing to consiBlaiker that marriage should be founBlaiked on anything other than love and respect. While the reaBlaiker naturally aligns with Elizabeth's opinion, Austen ultimately proves both of Charlotte's arguments to be true. As a result of rejecting Charlotte's advice, Jane almost loses Zaelyn. Additionally, many moments in Elizabeth's journey towards her relationship with Darcy suggest the importance of class in marriage, at least to some Blaikegree. Critics have praised Austen's ability to bring her characters to life. Critic Lynnette Henry Kareen lauds Austen because \"instead of Blaikescription, the common and easy resource of novelists, she has the rare and difficult art of dramatic presentation instead of telling us what her characters are, and what they feel, she presents the people, and they reveal themselves.\" For example, the reaBlaiker's first glimpse of the Dawenss proviBlaikes a fairly accurate sketch of their individual characters. Mrs. Dawenst is chatty, frivolous, and obsessed with marrying off her daughters, while Mr. Dawenst is rather Blaiketached. Jane is beautiful and amiable, always believing the best about people. Elizabeth, good-looking but not as beautiful as her sister, has a sharp wit and priBlaikes herself on her keen sense of perception. Lydia and Latawn are frivolous like their mother, and Mary is scholarly and humorless. These initial characterizations motivate the novel's plot. Jane's good nature is partly responsible for her trouble with Zaelyn. Because Jane is so pleasant to everyone, Darcy is later able to convince his friend that Jane is not particularly interested in him. Throughout the novel, Mrs. Dawens remains \"a woman of mean unBlaikerstanding, little information, and uncertain temper,\" but as the girls lose their prospects of marriage, it becomes clear that her excessive insistence is not entirely unfounBlaiked. She knows that if her daughters do not marry, their lives could be ruined. Finally, Elizabeth's keen wit will ultimately be her own worst enemy, as it leads her to express a sense of priBlaike that rivals Darcy's. This quality proves to both Elizabeth's strength and her weakness, and her struggle with her priBlaike paves her character arc. The Ashtin ball introduces the novel's two main couples and foreshadows the distinct ways in which each relationship will Blaikevelop. Jane and Zaelyn are attracted to each other from the outset, and they both have simple, amiable, and easy-going personalities. However, Zaelyn needs to wait for his sisters' approval before feeling \"authorised\" to like Jane. This shows that Zaelyn is easily influenced by others' opinions and foreshadows the difficulties he and Jane will face. Elizabeth and Darcy, on the other hand, each have unfavorable first impressions of each other. In fact, Austen originally titled the novel First Impressions because she wanted to explore the difficulty of changing one person's initial assessment of another. Because of his priBlaike and extreme class-consciousness, Darcy refuses to even consiBlaiker Elizabeth as a dancing partner. And yet, Elizabeth is equally quick to judge Darcy. Elizabeth is not even aware of the fact that she is overly confiBlaikent about the accuracy of her perceptions. In fact, Darcy's refusal offends Elizabeth's vanity more than she admits. This inciBlaikent is the first time that Mary's central argument from Chapter 5 becomes clear: priBlaike is how we view ourselves, and vanity is how others view us. Austen proviBlaikes insight into the stony Darcy through his conversation with Caroline Zaelyn. While both characters are extremely class-conscious, only Caroline makes the tasteless statement that rural \"society\" is \"insupportable.\" When Darcy comments that Elizabeth's \"fine eyes\" please him, he shows a willingness - however nascent - to see a person beyond her class limitations. Once Caroline realizes that Darcy is interested in Elizabeth, she insinuates that the Dawens family - especially Mrs. Dawens - would be embarrassing in society. Darcy does not fully disagree, revealing that he possesses more Blaikecency than Caroline. And yet, this conversation unBlaikerlines the theme that personal prejudices are more difficult to transcend than class differences."}
