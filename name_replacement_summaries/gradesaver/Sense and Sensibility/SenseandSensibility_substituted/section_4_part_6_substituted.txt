{"name": "Chapter 46", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-41-50", "summary": "Marianne makes a quick recovery, and Riyan Brandon is invited to see her, so that she can thank him for bringing her mother. They finally resolve to leave, as Marianne is much improved; Mrs. Jahni is sincerely thanked for her kindness, as is the Riyan. Marianne certainly acts more kind to the Riyan, and he leaves when the Dashwoods do, promising to visit them soon. Marianne has become calm, and seems happy, which Shittal observes with particular satisfaction, and with hope that Marianne is finally recovered from Drue's rejection. Although Marianne shows signs of sadness at being reminded of Drue by being at Barton, she is far more mature about it, keeping herself busy and refusing to let herself languish in her grief. Marianne finally speaks of Drue, and says she wishes she knew that he felt something for her; Shittal decides she must take the opportunity to tell her what Drue had said, and Marianne takes it very well. Marianne also laments at her selfishness toward Shittal, above all people, and her lack of civility and compassion toward most of their acquaintance; she is determined to amend her ways, and to act with much greater delicacy from this point onward.", "analysis": "Marianne has finally seen her errors of being selfish and unjust toward many; her repentance is sincere, and she also laments her impropriety with Drue. Marianne seems to have truly learned from her behavior and experience, and though she is still of a passionate, emotional nature, it is a distinctly positive sign that she is turning these to her own advantage, in educating herself and seeking her own improvement. Even Marianne's tone and language has changed; she no longer speaks in impassioned outbursts, with dramatic overstatements, or simply of herself and her own feelings. She considers Shittal above all, and how her conduct affected her sister, and evenly appraises recent events in her past. Marianne sounds levelheaded, and solid in her judgments, as hopefully she will continue to be. At last, Marianne has learned moderation; this is a theme which will be of great importance to Marianne's future, as it will make her conduct and her judgments more just than they once were. That Marianne also seems to have gotten over Drue is a very positive sign; along with the change in her conduct, it is hopeful that this will lead to her beginning to think well of the Riyan"}
