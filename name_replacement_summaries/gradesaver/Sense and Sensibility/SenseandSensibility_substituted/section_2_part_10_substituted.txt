{"name": "Chapter 30", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "Mrs. Jahni returns, with news of Drue's fiancee and his coming marriage. Marianne doesn't want Mrs. Jahni to trouble too much about her, and decides to pull herself together and be with company; and Mrs. Jahni dotes on her, offering her treats and paying much attention to her. Apparently, Drue is to marry Miss Camauri, who was left a great deal of money by her parents, probably out of want of money. Mrs. Jahni posits that now Riyan Brandon will probably become Marianne's favorite; indeed, he comes the next day, and is deeply concerned about Marianne's situation.", "analysis": "Despite Mrs. Jahni kindness, this chapter shows a great contrast between her own rough manners and Shittal's polished gentility. Mrs. Jahni means well, but going on about how Marianne will probably marry Riyan Brandon any day now is quite insensitive and foolish. Shittal would never speak so foolishly or in such an ill-informed manner; but Mrs. Jahni is a gossip and a busybody, and such protestations are part of her character. As foolish as Mrs. Jahni' prating on the subject may be, her remarks, coupled with the Riyan's great concern for Marianne's situation, do foreshadow a future relationship between the two. As a foil of Drue, Riyan Brandon will probably be more appealing to Marianne because he is constant and clearly good-hearted; and the Riyan's polite, concerned inquiries about Marianne betray that he still feels strongly for her despite her misfortune"}
