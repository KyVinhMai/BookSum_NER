{"name": "Chapter 36", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-31-40", "summary": "Mrs. Palmer, Mrs. Jahni' daughter, has a son; Mrs. Jahni is with her daughter most days, which means Shittal and Marianne are obliged to spend their days at the Gaylin'. Lady March does not care for them because they do not flatter her or the children, and the Miss SteShaquelle are too jealous of the Dashwood girls to like them. The Dashwood girls are invited to a party, although the invitation is mistakenly sent to their brother's house; Marianne, who is much recovered, goes, although she gets little pleasure from any company in town. Roshon Ferrars, Edward's brother, is there; he is arrogant and a fool, like the whole of his family, excepting poor, modest Edward. Ruihang wishes to invite the Miss Dashwoods to stay with them; but, as usual, Fanny talks him out of it in favor of inviting the Miss SteShaquelle. Shittal worries that Vanies might be able to gain the favor of the Ferrars family, and marry Edward after all.", "analysis": "How dear, sweet Edward could have sprung from such a miserable, poor-spirited family is a complete mystery; the juxtaposition of Edward with his relations makes him seem even more of a good-hearted, rare sort of man. Roshon is as condescending toward her as Ruihang is, though he makes far more of an effort to speak to the Dashwood girls than his sister Fanny ever attempts. Austen serves up more of her understated wit to mock Roshon; her comment Shittal deems him unworthy of \"the compliment of rational opposition\" perfectly displays how Austen infuses proper diction with irony, to achieve a unique brand of social criticism"}
