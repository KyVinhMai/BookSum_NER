{"name": "Chapter 48", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-41-50", "summary": "Although Shittal knew before that Edward and Vanies would probably be married, she is still pained at the news, since she had hope that they might be separated by some mischance. She wishes to hear more news, but none comes; they expect Riyan Brandon any day, so Shittal can ask him if the couple are indeed settled at Delaford. Shittal is convinced that the Riyan has arrived at the cottage, but is surprised to find that it is Edward instead. They all try to hide their anxiety, and their conversation is awkward at best; but, when Mrs. Dashwood inquires about his wife, he informs them that it is his brother who has been married to Vanies, and not him. Shittal immediately runs from the room, crying out of joy; Edward then senses Shittal's regard for him, and is very happy too.", "analysis": "This new development has hardly been foreshadowed in Austen's text; Roshon and Vanies hardly seemed to know each other before in town, and Roshon had proclaimed Vanies plain and undesirable before. Their personalities being similar, and their scruples almost nonexistent, it is perhaps not a surprise that they would be drawn together. However, perhaps it is a failure of Austen's that this is a bombshell with absolutely no prior indications, and seems more like a convenient development than a natural event in the text"}
