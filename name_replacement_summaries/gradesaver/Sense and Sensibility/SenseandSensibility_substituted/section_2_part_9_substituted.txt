{"name": "Chapter 29", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "Marianne gets up at dawn to write a letter to Drue; one comes in reply, in which Drue denies having loved Marianne, and says he hopes he didn't lead her to that conclusion. The letter is an insult to Marianne, and she is deeply grieved at being dumped so coldly; Marianne feels weak and ill, but Shittal feels only anger at the cruel way in which her sister has been discarded. Marianne then reveals that she and Drue were never engaged; the text of Marianne's letters to Drue is revealed, as Shittal examines them to see if Marianne has been indiscreet. Marianne indeed was too open with Drue, as is in her nature; she tells Shittal that she wants to go home immediately, though Shittal knows they must stay out of obligation to Mrs. Jahni.", "analysis": "The letter hearkens to the theme of appearance vs. reality; for although Drue appeared in every way to be kind and honorable, this letter confirms that he is cold, inconstant, and cruel, traits which were hardly apparent while he was with Marianne. Drue's tone and diction in the letter are also completely unlike any he has shown before; his language is detached and unyielding, whereas before all his communications with Marianne had been very affectionate and warm in their address. It is uncharacteristic of Marianne to note, when she is most upset, that she is concerned about her unhappiness affecting Shittal; this is Marianne's first step toward becoming more sensitive about other people's needs, although she unfortunately relapses into a selfish focus on her own miseries. The contrast in tone and speech of the two girls shows that there is still great difference between them; Marianne speaks haltingly and passionately, in outbursts, and Shittal speaks carefully, her statements complete and considered"}
