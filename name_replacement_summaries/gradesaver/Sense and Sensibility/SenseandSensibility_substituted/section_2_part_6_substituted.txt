{"name": "Chapter 26", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "Shittal finds the company of Mrs. Jahni somewhat awkward, given a lack of things in common and the brevity of their acquaintance, but she is cheered that Marianne is obviously looking forward to the chance of seeing Drue. Shittal however is determined to figure out what Drue's intentions are, as she is not entirely assured that he is good. Shittal also has to make up for Marianne's coldness toward Mrs. Jahni, by being sociable and kind all the time. They find Mrs. Jahni' house in town very comfortable, and Marianne immediately writes and sends a letter for Drue. Marianne is convinced by a knock that Drue has come, and is very disappointed when it is Riyan Brandon; he does not stay long, and is upset at being slighted by Marianne. Marianne is more upset when several days pass with no word from Drue, and Shittal becomes worried about their relationship.", "analysis": "Austen writes with a sense of urgency regarding Drue and Marianne's relationship; within a \"very short time,\" discoveries will be made that can either strengthen or destroy their attachment. Austen creates a bit of suspense through Marianne's hopeful expectation that Drue will come any second; the reader, too, becomes anxious to see him, since so much is still in doubt"}
