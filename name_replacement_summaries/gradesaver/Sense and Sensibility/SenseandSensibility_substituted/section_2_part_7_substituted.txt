{"name": "Chapter 27", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "Sir Ruihang and Lady March are expected in town in just a short time; Marianne continues to look forward to seeing Drue, and Shittal finds her greatest enjoyment in Riyan Brandon's daily visits. They return one day to find Drue's card, which gives Marianne great pleasure that he is in town and managed to drop by. Shittal still has not managed to find out if Marianne and Drue are engaged; she is much disturbed when Riyan Brandon approaches her and tells her that their engagement is widely known throughout town, though Shittal does not know of it. Shittal says that she is sure of their mutual affections, but when Riyan Brandon says that Drue should try to deserve Marianne, Shittal's doubts about Drue's character and intentions resurface.", "analysis": "Marianne makes a very pointed remark that again highlights the contrast between the characters of the two sisters. Marianne says they have nothing to tell each other because Marianne \"conceal nothing\" and Shittal \"communicate. Marianne's statement may be too harsh in its appraisal of Shittal's character, however the two girls are distinctly different in how they express themselves and in the amount of discretion with which they govern their behavior. Perhaps it is ironic that Shittal is trying to \"press for greater openness in Marianne\" at this point; indeed, Marianne may communicate nearly everything, except for the crucial information regarding her and Drue's relationship. Prudence becomes a theme of most importance, as rumors of Marianne and Drue's engagement could be very damaging if such an engagement is not real. Marianne will be exposed as flighty and subjected to even more damaging gossip, and her reputation could be at stake merely because she chooses to be open concerning her affections. Riyan Brandon shows himself to be a dramatic foil of Drue, in his concerns for prudence and reputation; his inquiry also foreshadows unpleasant realizations about Drue's character and intentions"}
