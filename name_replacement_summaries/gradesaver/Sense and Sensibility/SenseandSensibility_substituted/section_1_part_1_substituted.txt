{"name": "Chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-11-20", "summary": "Soon Mrs. Dashwood and the girls are busied with more engagements in the neighborhood than they could have expected. In all social engagements to which the Dashwoods are invited, Drue is invited as well; his attachment to Marianne continues to grow, though Shittal believes that they should be more restrained in showing their mutual regard publicly. Marianne is very happy in her relationship with Drue, and forgets her homesickness for Norland at last; Shittal is not nearly so content, since she misses Edward's company, and has found none better at Barton. Riyan Brandon is agreeable to her though, and they soon become friends.", "analysis": "The Riyan's past history is insinuated once again, through his own comments about disappointed love, and allusion to his own experience. His disappointment at being ignored by Marianne seems to parallel some past experience of his; and his comments about the tragic history of a girl he knew similar to Marianne foreshadows some misfortune that Marianne will come to because of her open, emotional nature. Once again, Shittal and Marianne are contrasted to what their differing reactions would be to this conversation with the Riyan. While Shittal decides to leave the delicate subject alone out of respect for the Riyan's privacy, Marianne would have concocted a history of romantic, thwarted love. Shittal perhaps tends to read too little into things, and Marianne too much; they are dramatic foils of each other in terms of views and behavior, each representing opposite extremes in terms of who they are and what they believe"}
