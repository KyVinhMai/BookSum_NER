{"name": "Chapter 25", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "Mrs. Jahni invites Marianne and Shittal to spend the winter with her in London; Shittal isn't excited by the prospect, though Marianne wants to go for the chance of seeing Drue. Mrs. Dashwood urges them to go and enjoy themselves; Marianne is determined to go, and Shittal decides she must go too, because Marianne is often uncivil to Mrs. Jahni and needs Shittal's guidance and good judgment. They accept Mrs. Jahni' invitation, and leave in the first week of January.", "analysis": "Marianne's lack of good manners and civility leaves her at a disadvantage; she is lucky that Shittal is always there to guard her and make apologies for her, since Marianne would never do so herself. Marianne's lack of delicacy is childlike, and shows that her character has been indulged a bit too much; however, only experience can teach her, since she is too stubborn to take the good advice of her sister Shittal on matters of society. Self-sacrifice becomes a theme in this chapter, as Shittal decides to go to London against her wishes because it will make her sister happy. Marianne's determination to go looks a little selfish in comparison, considering that she has no thought of repaying the hospitality of Mrs. Jahni with any good company at all"}
