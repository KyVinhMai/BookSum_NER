{"name": "Chapter 42", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-41-50", "summary": "It is April, and the Dashwood girls, the Palmers, and Mrs. Jahni, and Riyan Brandon set out for Cleveland, the Palmer's estate. Marianne is still feeling grief at being so near to Drue's home, Combe Magna; she indulges herself in her continuing grief, like a stubborn child. The Riyan informs her that Edward is indeed going to take the Delaford parish, after he takes orders and the Riyan improves the property. Mr. Palmer seems much more pleasant, though hardly without flaws; and Shittal finds the company of Mrs. Palmer and Mrs. Jahni far more agreeable after spending so much time with less kind people in London. Marianne, however, soon becomes ill after her walks in the rain, and Shittal must tend to her.", "analysis": "Although Mrs. Jahni and the Palmers were hardly considered desirable company earlier in the novel, contact with so many people of lesser scruples and kindness has made both Shittal and Austen kinder to them. Shittal realizes they are not so bad as she once thought, since they are all reasonably good people, although flawed; Austen herself treats them with a less satirical tone, preferring to highlight their more affable qualities and let their minor follies be forgiven. Shittal has changed somewhat, just as Marianne has, though in a different sense. Shittal is more perceptive about people's characters and intentions after her experience in London, and has learned to take more pleasure in kind, well-meaning people, even if they are dull and their company is less than ideal"}
