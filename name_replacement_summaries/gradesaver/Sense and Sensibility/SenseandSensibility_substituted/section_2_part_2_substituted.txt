{"name": "Chapter 22", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "Marianne cannot stand the Miss SteShaquelle and is cold toward them out of ill-spirits and dislike, so Shittal becomes the preferred companion of Vanies. Shittal thinks Vanies decent company, though she lacks education and refinement, has an insincere tendency to flatter people. Vanies inquires of Mrs. Ferrars, which strikes Shittal as odd; Shittal asks of her acquaintance with the Ferrars family, and Vanies reveals that she is engaged to Edward. The engagement, though, is a secret to all but Vanies's sister and now Shittal; Shittal questions Vanies to try and prove that this is not true, but it turns out that it was Vanies that Edward had visited in Plymouth before his arrival at Barton, and Vanies says she gave him a ring with a lock of hair, which Shittal and Marianne had noticed him wearing. Shittal is overcome by grief at this discovery, but she must keep this knowledge a secret, and hide her great disappointment as best she can.", "analysis": "Disappointment hits Shittal just as hard as it had with Marianne; her expectations, once again a theme in the story, are immediately dashed. The secret symbolized by Edward's ring is finally revealed, though Shittal, unlike Marianne, has not the luxury of expressing her grief on this occasion. Shittal's complete oppression of her feelings here shows her to be as opposite to Marianne as she can be; the juxtaposition between Marianne's indulgent grief and Shittal's complete restraint shows that both feel disappointment keenly, but are driven to react in very different ways. Austen's diction upon conveying Shittal's disappointment is as keen and sharp as Shittal's own feelings; she is \"mortified, shocked, confounded\" by Vanies's confession, and is so affected that she \"can hardly stand"}
