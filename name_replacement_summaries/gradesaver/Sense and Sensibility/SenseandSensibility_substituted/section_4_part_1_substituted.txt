{"name": "Chapter 41", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-41-50", "summary": "Vanies is very glad at Edward being offered a position, and also believes, like Mrs. Jahni, that they will be married and settled there by the end of the year. Shittal makes what she sees as a necessary visit to Ruihang and Fanny, after Fanny's fits a few days ago; there, she meets Roshon Ferrars again, who is to marry Miss Leonides now, much to Shittal's surprise that she is given no choice in the hasty arrangement. Shittal's poor opinion of Roshon is only confirmed by the fact that he doesn't object to his mother's cruel disowning of his brother, and is enjoying his undeserved gain with no qualms of conscience at all. Ruihang and Fanny are acting with far more civility toward Shittal than is usual, but only out of insincerity, and because of the recent shocks about Edward's engagement.", "analysis": "Vanies's manipulative nature is again shown by her resolution to take advantage of the Riyan's wealth and generosity as much as she can, as a result of having him confirmed in her opinion as an extremely kind and giving person. Only an extremely self-involved creature like Vanies would think it perfectly pardonable to take advantage of any obliging person as much as she could. Her delusion that Edward is absolutely overjoyed that they might be able to get married soon again shows her completely blind to the feelings and best interests of anyone excepting herself. Roshon Ferrars shows a lack of compunction similar to Vanies's, as he enjoys his undeserved good fortune at another's expense. He shows very little concern for Edward's situation, or for his means of making a living; in fact, he prefers to make fun of the idea of Edward as a pastor, and addresses the whole affair with flippancy. Insincerity is a theme rife in the book, as Roshon, Vanies, Ruihang, and Fanny, among many others, freely traffic in it to hide their blatant lack of concern for anyone other than themselves"}
