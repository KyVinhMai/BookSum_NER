{"name": "Chapter 39", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-31-40", "summary": "Marianne is desperate to finally be gone from London; but they are to stay until they go to the Palmers' with Mrs. Jahni, which is part of the way home from London. Marianne refuses to go there, however, because of the proximity to Drue's estate, although Shittal convinces her that this is the best plan. Mrs. Jahni is convinced by an overheard conversation between Shittal and the Riyan that they will soon be a match; but, their conversation has nothing to do with themselves, but rather Edward's difficult situation. The Riyan, although he barely knows Edward, generously offers the parish at Delaford to him, though it will hardly enable him to marry; Shittal is to convey the offer to Edward, to see if he will accept.", "analysis": "Despite Shittal and the Riyan's friendship, it seems quite obvious at this point that they will not become a couple, although ironically, they are considered to be almost betrothed by many. Ironically, the conversation they have is not about themselves, as Mrs. Jahni figures it is, but about Edward, despite the fact that the Riyan is little acquainted with him. The Riyan's generous, good spirit is again demonstrated through his concern for Edward. Even more of an irony is that Shittal is to offer Edward some means for him to get married, when she is the last person who wishes this to happen"}
