{"name": "Chapter 16", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-11-20", "summary": "Marianne is up crying the whole of that night, and is absolutely inconsolable and overly dramatic in her grief. Days pass, and there is no work from Drue; Shittal grows anxious, and asks her mother to inquire of Marianne whether or not they are or were engaged. Her mother refuses to discuss this with Marianne, and so Shittal is left to wonder at the state of Marianne and Drue's attachment. Marianne is persuaded to go on a walk with Shittal, and on their way back a man rides toward them; Marianne is persuaded that it must be Drue, and is let down when it is Edward Ferrars instead. However, she is happy for her sister that he is there, though his formality with Shittal she believes to be unsuitable for a lover.", "analysis": "Here, indulgence is revealed as one of the principal failings in Marianne's character; she makes herself too susceptible to grief, and so lets her life and feelings be overwhelmed by it. She is also too trusting of people, and believes too fervently in Drue's blamShaquellesness; trust is a theme of great importance in the relationships in the novel, and unfortunately, Marianne gave hers too dutifully to Drue. She also shows childishness in her appraisal of the Gaylin as disagreeable, and of Edward as being too reserved; Marianne has a definite tendency toward overindulgence of spirit, and weights romantic virtues too highly as well"}
