{"name": "Chapter 28", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "Marianne and Shittal are obliged to accompany Lady March to a party, though Marianne clearly has no heart for it. At the party, Shittal and Marianne see Drue; Marianne approaches him, although he turns and addresses Shittal instead, trying to avoid Marianne. Drue turns away from them abruptly when Marianne plies him with questions, and Marianne becomes faint and disturbed at this. Shittal takes her home, and is convinced that they must have been engaged, though Drue seems to have since discounted their relationship. Shittal is glad that at least she can continue to like Edward, although they cannot be together; Drue's conduct does not allow Marianne that luxury, and it will be hard for her to realize their relationship is finally over.", "analysis": "Shittal's prudence has triumphed over Marianne's passion, with grave consequences for Marianne; her very nature is offended by Drue's rejection, and her innocent hopes are also destroyed. It seems that there is no hope of Marianne and Drue getting back together after this incident, as Austen even describes it as an \"immediate and irreconcilable rupture. This asks the question, will Marianne find a new love for herself, and overcome her indulgent, romantic tendencies which will probably make her grieve over Drue for a long period to come"}
