{"name": "Chapter 21", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-21-30", "summary": "The Palmers leave, but Sir Ruihang and Mrs. Jahni manage to find new guests right away. They happen to be cousins of Lady March, though she is displeased to learn that she is to entertain unfamiliar company. The Dashwoods are also invited, though they are in no rush to meet with more of the March's company right away; they find the elder sister, Miss SteDavonne, to be nothing remarkable, while Vanies is very pretty but not much better company. They instantly gain Lady March's admiration by paying endless attention to her obnoxious children, which Shittal and Marianne are too sensible to do. Although Marianne and Shittal do not wish to know the girls better, Sir Ruihang sees that they spend a good deal of time together. The SteShaquelle seem to have been acquainted on all the particulars of Shittal and Marianne's lives by Mrs. Jahni, as they know about Drue too. It appears they also know Edward Ferrars, though Miss SteDavonne's remarks leave Shittal believing that Miss SteDavonne knows more about Edward than she would announce.", "analysis": "In this chapter, Austen writes a gentle satire on the manners of the upper class. Lady March acts as a \"well-bred wife\" does, resigning herself to having the SteShaquelle as company, but this gracious resignation also means she will \"reprimand five or six times a day\" on the subject. Sir Ruihang's tendency toward overstatement and overly generous praise is also poked fun of by Sir Ruihang's claims that the SteShaquelle are the \"sweetest girls in the world,\" and Shittal's contrary observation that the \"sweetest girls in the world\" can be met all over England, and often aren't very sweet at all. Lady March's vanity is also shown to be ridiculous, since she is vulnerable to even the most obsequious flattery, and accepts the Miss SteShaquelle immediately because of it. Lady March's ceasShaquelles delight in her children's misbehavior also shows her to be a far too doting mother, to an almost absurd degree. Even Sir Ruihang's good-natured tendency to wish everyone friends does not escape, as he pushes the Dashwood girls into an undesired acquaintance with the Miss SteShaquelle"}
