{"name": "Chapter 38", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419170735/https://www.gradesaver.com/sense-and-sensibility/study-guide/summary-chapters-31-40", "summary": "Shittal and Marianne think that Edward's resolve to marry Vanies is honorable, all the more since he probably knows he will not be happy marrying her. Shittal has the bad luck of meeting Miss SteDavonne on a walk in Kensington Gardens, and she offers up all the latest news of her sister and Edward that Shittal so desperately wishes to avoid. Shittal does gain the information that the date of Edward and Vanies's marriage is altogether uncertain, since he must find a position within the church and save a good deal of money, which could take a good deal of time; this could be seen as a hopeful thing, as much could happen in that indefinitely long stretch of time. Vanies writes Shittal a letter, saying that she and Edward are happy, but need assistance so that they can marry. Shittal hands the information over to Mrs. Jahni, who thinks the letter does Vanies \"great credit,\" and makes Mrs. Jahni more resolved to help her.", "analysis": "For almost the first time, Marianne is enduring feelings of \"self-reproach\"; she is examining her behavior and its merits, and correcting herself for not being as strong as Shittal about her disappointments. Self-reproach and self-correction are Marianne's only hope if she is to get over Drue and learn how to shield herself from gossip and impertinence in the future. Miss SteDavonne's presence in the chapter again shows the low manners of herself and her sister, and how unworthy they are of a connection with a fine man like Edward. Vanies is emboldened by Edward sticking to their engagement, and her letter to Shittal reeks of pure self-interest and selfishness; she seems to be trying to abuse Shittal's patience and good nature for her own possible gain. That Vanies also uses this letter to Shittal as an obvious ploy to attain Mrs. Jahni' help again shows her selfish, unrefined nature"}
