Emma visits the Bates in order to see Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Elton is also there and tells Emma that she knows the good news about her and Mr. Knightley. Emma learns that Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax will marry soon, after an appropriate period of mourning for Mrs. Churchill.", "analysis": "With Harriet gone from Highbury, Emma is free to enjoy Mr. Knightley's presence. This chapter emphasizes the inappropriateness of Emma's friendship with Harriet Smith. Harriet is a burden to Emma with her consistent heartbreaks and fragile nature, but in this case she bears the news about Mr. Knightley well. Austen gives the sense that Harriet's disappointment is necessary and even appropriate in order to force her to settle on a man who has an equal status. Unlike her situation with Mr. Elton, Harriet is entirely to blame for any pain she has suffered because of her feelings for Mr. Knightley. Since Mr. Knightley did not mislead her, Harriet's belief that he might love her is entirely a product of her developing vanity. The chapter also reinforces the earlier theme that marriage does not simply affect the prospective husband and wife. Just as Emma and Mr. Knightley have to think about others' desires and emotions, Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill must show the proper respect to others. Marrying so soon after Mrs. Churchill died would be an affront to her memory, since it would indicate how the ill-tempered old woman prevented Frank from doing as he pleased"}
