Emma and Mr. Knightley publicly share the news of their engagement. Mr. Woodhouse dislikes the idea of Emma marrying Mr. Knightley because it would force him to change his habits. Still, he inevitably assents to the marriage, and Emma hopes that time and reassurance will inevitably soften the old man. Emma tells Mr. Knightley that she cannot call him by his first name but promises to call him George after they are married.", "analysis": "Austen explores the dynamics of marriage and courtship in this chapter with the reminder that elite parents immediately plan for their child's marriage. Just barely after she has been delivered, Anna Weston already seems a possible match for Henry Knightley. Also, the birth of Anna Weston gives additional light on the role of the governess. Emma notes that Miss Weston will be performing essentially the same job for her daughter that she did when she taught Emma at Hartfield. Other details of the formality of courtship emerge. To Emma, her fiance will be Mr. Knightley until they marry, and only then will she call him George. She still considers it improper to use his first name, even though they are engaged. Also, there is proper etiquette for revealing news of the marriage that Emma and Mr. Knightley must follow. Mr. Woodhouse, the most difficult case, must know almost immediately, and it is also proper form to tell the Westons. However, there are few members of Highbury society who can be ignored; it would even be impolite not to tell Jane Fairfax and Miss Bates the news"}
