He takes her hand and is about to kiss it, yet suddenly lets it go. The following day, there is news that Mrs. Churchill has died. Emma now realizes that there is no obstacle between Frank and Harriet. She also learns that Jane Fairfax is now in ill health, likely depressed that she must go to Maple Grove.", "analysis": "In this chapter, Emma is determined to set right her previous ill will toward Jane Fairfax. She strenuously attempts to visit her and wish her better health. Not only does she think well of Jane, she now wishes to do something about it. Emma acts with a newfound modesty. She is even embarrassed when her devoted but delusional father compliments her for kindness toward Miss Bates. Mr. Knightley's romantic attentions toward Emma become more overt in this chapter, although he remains reluctant. He takes her hand when he senses her embarrassment over the false praise, a subtle physical gesture that represents a shift from verbal expressions of emotion that predominate the novel. He is at the verge of expressing his love for Emma but still hesitates. The death of Mrs. Churchill is a truly unexpected event in the novel, for whatever illness she earlier claimed seemed to be a false pretense for getting Frank Churchill to be near her. Still, the major obstacle for Frank Churchill is now removed. He no longer is prevented from declaring his love for anyone. Yet despite the overwhelming evidence that he must be in love with Jane Fairfax, Emma persists in believing that he could love Harriet Smith"}
