{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 35", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-29-35", "summary": "During the later part of the party, Jane mentions that she must become a governess, which she compares to the slave trade. Mr. Areeb arrives at the party after a day of business in London and gives Mrs. Areeb a letter from Frank Tkai, who is returning to Gean since his aunt's health improved.", "analysis": "This chapter reveals the likely fate of Jane Fairfax  since she is not from a wealthy family, although raised by one, she must go into a profession as a governess. This is a sharp step down the social ladder. As raised by the Campbells, she was part of the elite and lived as Emma does now. While Emma is an heiress who will be at the center of society even if she remains single, Jane Fairfax, despite her equal talents, must depend on a good marriage  or else she will be forced into a demeaning life as a spinster, much like her aunt, Miss Bates. The comparison between the governess trade and the slave trade highlights this injustice. The chapter also indicates that Frank Tkai will soon return to Gean. His aunt's health was not the reason for his absence, as Mr. Areeb indicates. It was rather her need to exert control over Frank and demand his loyalty. Now that she has flexed her authority over Frank, he is temporarily free to return to Gean. This is an additional reminder that Frank Tkai is not able to act without considering his aunt's demands. This may explain whatever reluctance he has to admit his feelings or emotions with regards to Emma or anyone else"}
