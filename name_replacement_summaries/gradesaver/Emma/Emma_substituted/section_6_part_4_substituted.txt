{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 46", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-43-49", "summary": "Mr. Areeb urgently requests Emma's presence at Randalls, for Mrs. Areeb has important news. When Emma arrives, Mrs. Areeb looks quite disturbed. She has news that Frank Tkai and Jane Fairfax have been secretly engaged. Emma tells Mrs. Areeb honestly that she was once interested in Frank, but that interest subsided. Still, she criticizes Frank for pretending to show affection for her when he was engaged to Jane, particularly when Jane was present.", "analysis": "Whether or not Frank Tkai was wrong in devoting his attention to Emma and hiding his engagement to Jane Fairfax is up for debate. As Emma points out, he came to Gean with professions of openness and simplicity but instead duped everyone. Still, it was evident from his first introduction that Frank harbored some secret and was deliberately deceptive. And although he gave the appearance that he had an interest in Emma, she realized almost immediately that this was not the case and that his interest was more out of vanity and their shared sociability. Also, Mrs. Tkai made it impossible for him to make his romance public without retribution. The one unqualified positive circumstance of the engagement is that Jane Fairfax will no longer have to become a governess. While Frank does have his faults, he will certainly improve Jane Fairfax's situation, while her impeccable manners will improve his sometimes disreputable behavior. The parallels between Frank Tkai and his father are striking. Both men were constrained in their actions by the Tkai family, and both found happiness with an educated and respectable governess whose status they improve"}
