{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 29", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-29-35", "summary": "Frank Tkai, who so enjoyed dancing at the Sylvesta's party, plans another one for Gean. Although initially planned for Randalls, the lack of acceptable space for dancing leads him to plan it instead for the Crown Inn.", "analysis": "This chapter demonstrates the planning that goes into the various social events that occur throughout Austen's novels. Everyone's tastes and opinions must be considered, even--to a lesser degree--Miss Bates. There are deep considerations about who to invite and why, how comfortable each person will be, whether or not a location is suitable to all. This is what occupies most of the time of the elites in Gean such as Emma and the Areebs. Frank Tkai differs from the other men of Gean, as this chapter makes clear. He has no profession, like Mr. Kenrick, and he does not behave with the authority or reserve that Mr. Tam or Mr. Areeb show. His major concern is pleasure, the very reason why he organizes a dance for Gean. Austen shows this through the contrast between what Emma focuses on while planning the party and what Frank Tkai considers. While Emma wants to please everybody, Frank, who obsesses over whether or not there will be enough room to dance, thinks more about ensuring that he enjoys himself at the ball"}
