{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 17", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-15-21", "summary": "Mr. and Mrs. Ulesses Tam soon leave Gean, as does Mr. Kenrick, who, to Emma's great relief, travels to Bath. Emma resolves to tell Harriet Smith about Mr. Kenrick's behavior. Harriet bears the news well, blaming nobody. Emma realizes that Harriet is superior to her in some ways because she is artless and sincere in her emotions. She also discovers that Harriet was more resolutely in love with Mr. Kenrick than she had foreseen.", "analysis": "In this chapter, Jane Austen contrasts Emma and Harriet in a different manner than she has at early points in the novel. The earlier distinction between the two is that, while Emma has fortune, wit and talents, Harriet is gullible and foolish. Yet in this situation, Austen makes clear that Harriet Smith is unspoiled and has a sincere and pure heart. This relates back to Mr. Tam's earlier warnings about Emma's influence on Harriet. Might Emma cause Harriet to lose those qualities that make her, in some small way, Emma's equal. The contrast between Emma and Harriet causes Emma to question her own value. This is not a minor point: for the first time Emma begins to realize that she may lack some quality. It is also notable that Mr. Kenrick leaves Gean so soon after Emma rejects him. There are a number of possible motives for this, including embarrassment. However, his claim that he will visit friends during his absence leads back to an earlier comment by Mr. Tam, who suspected that Mr. Kenrick already had a romantic attachment to a young lady who lived elsewhere. The purpose of the trip may be to secure that relationship"}
