{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 28", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-22-28", "summary": "At the Bates' home, Emma listens to Jane play. Mr. Tam stops by the Bates' while Emma and Frank are there, but because of the numerous visitors he promises to call another time. Miss Bates thanks Mr. Tam for sending them his store of apples.", "analysis": "At the Bates home, Jane Fairfax is the obvious center of attention. When Emma arrives, Frank Tkai is helping her fix her new piano so that she may play. Mr. Tam arrives to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, and by extension, Jane Fairfax. Austen is deliberately ambiguous about Jane Fairfax's courtship possibilities. The actions of both Frank Tkai and Mr. Tam indicate a possible romantic interest in her, but Frank disguises any possible interest by showing such great attention to Emma, while Mr. Tam behaves with such dignity that no action can be perceived as outwardly romantic. The main subtlety in the chapter is that Mr. Tam's behavior is consistent throughout the novel. It seems more likely that he would treat Jane Fairfax kindly without having an ulterior motive, since he has such a high regard for decency and benevolence"}
