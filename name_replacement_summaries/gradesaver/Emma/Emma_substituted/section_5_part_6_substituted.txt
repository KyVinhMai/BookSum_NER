{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 41", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-36-42", "summary": "Mr. Tam only grows to dislike Frank Tkai more, as he suspects double-dealing in Frank's pursuit of Emma. It seemed indisputable that Emma was the object of his affections, but Mr. Tam suspects that he had an interest in Jane Fairfax the whole time. Over tea at Hartfield, Emma, Frank, Harriet and Jane play word games in which they must guess words. The word that Frank gives Jane to guess is \"Willliam,\" which greatly annoys Jane, who promptly quits the game. Mr. Tam tells Emma about his suspicions about Frank and Jane, but she thinks that there is no romance between them. Mr. Tam is irritated by the entire situation.", "analysis": "Even though Emma is convinced that Frank Tkai has no romantic interest in her, Mr. Tam is concerned that he is still pretending to have an feelings for her. He believes that Frank and Jane are having an affair and, as Mr. Tam has been consistently correct in judging others' actions, this suspicion is almost significant evidence of the affair. Where he errs is in the idea that Frank Tkai will harm Emma through the deception. Emma is perfectly clear that she does not love Frank, but Mr. Tam still feels threatened by him. This continues to build the possibility that Mr. Tam is interested in Emma. His greatest care in this situation is that Emma does not get hurt. Still, although Emma will not be hurt by Frank Tkai, his behavior is still inappropriately deceptive. He does have a manipulative nature, but does not direct it towards Emma. During the game, Frank teases and taunts Jane Fairfax to the point that she must leave the game. The purpose of Frank Tkai's games seems to push Jane Fairfax into losing her sense of reserve and to reveal her true emotions. This scene parallels the earlier incident in which Mr. Kenrick uses the riddle \"charade\" to declare his feelings to Emma via Harriet Smith. Emma finds herself yet again in the middle of a romantic game in which true feelings and emotions cannot properly be conveyed"}
