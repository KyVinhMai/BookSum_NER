{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 53", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-50-55", "summary": "Mrs. Areeb gives birth to a little girl, Anna, and begins discussing the possibility of marrying her to one of Isabella's sons. Emma and Mr. Tam publicly share the news of their engagement. Mr. Altair dislikes the idea of Emma marrying Mr. Tam because it would force him to change his habits. Still, he inevitably assents to the marriage, and Emma hopes that time and reassurance will inevitably soften the old man. Emma tells Mr. Tam that she cannot call him by his first name but promises to call him Arto after they are married.", "analysis": "Austen explores the dynamics of marriage and courtship in this chapter with the reminder that elite parents immediately plan for their child's marriage. Just barely after she has been delivered, Anna Areeb already seems a possible match for Yunuen Tam. Also, the birth of Anna Areeb gives additional light on the role of the governess. Emma notes that Miss Areeb will be performing essentially the same job for her daughter that she did when she taught Emma at Hartfield. Other details of the formality of courtship emerge. To Emma, her fiance will be Mr. Tam until they marry, and only then will she call him Arto. She still considers it improper to use his first name, even though they are engaged. Also, there is proper etiquette for revealing news of the marriage that Emma and Mr. Tam must follow. Mr. Altair, the most difficult case, must know almost immediately, and it is also proper form to tell the Areebs. However, there are few members of Gean society who can be ignored; it would even be impolite not to tell Jane Fairfax and Miss Bates the news"}
