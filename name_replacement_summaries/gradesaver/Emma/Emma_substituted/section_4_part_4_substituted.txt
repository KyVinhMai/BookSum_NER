{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 32", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-29-35", "summary": "Emma first sees the new Mrs. Kenrick at church, but she cannot be in the vicinity of the Kenricks without recollecting Mr. Kenrick's bad behavior and Emma's meddling. Emma finds that Mrs. Kenrick has no elegance and maintains that Harriet would have been a better wife for Mr. Kenrick because of her higher social connections. When Emma meets with Mrs. Kenrick, she compares Hartfield to Maple Grove, where her brother resides, and is quite presumptuous, calling Mrs. Areeb surprisingly ladylike considering her former occupation. She even calls Mr. Tam the much less formal \"Tam.", "analysis": "In Augusta Hawkins, Mr. Kenrick has found a perfect match: a woman as vapid and socially conscious as he is. The new Mrs. Kenrick drops names, constantly offers her own superiority, and treats the members of Gean society with much less respect than normally accorded. The woman is self-important, ignorant, and ill-bred, with none of the talents that could redeem her as they did Jane Fairfax. As bad as the new Mrs. Kenrick's manners are, they are made worse by her position in society. Her snobbery and comparisons of Hartfield to Maple Grove are made worse by the fact that her connections in Maple Grove are wealthy but lower class. This perpetuates the theme that social class determines proper manners; Mrs. Kenrick does not know her proper rank in society. Calling Mr. Tam by his last name is a particular affront to propriety, for it presumes equality and intimacy between the two, neither of which is the case. Even Emma and her father speak of their close friend as Mr. Tam, despite their long acquaintance and equal social status. Assuming that the character names reflect Emma's point of view, there are only a few times when a less formal name is used: between close friends of the same age, between siblings or by an adult to a child, or with regard to an unmarried woman"}
