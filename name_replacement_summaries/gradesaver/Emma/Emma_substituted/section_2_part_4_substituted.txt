{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 18", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-15-21", "summary": "The Areebs are disappointed that Frank Tkai has not come to Gean, and once again postponed his visit once. Mr. Tam suspects that the Tkais are to blame for Frank's absence, but notes that Frank is nevertheless a grown, independent man who can do as he wishes. He feels that Frank Tkai is more interested in leisure activities. Emma argues with Mr. Tam, by asserting that going against the Tkais' wishes would be impractical. Emma defends Frank Tkai at nearly every opportunity, while Mr. Tam predicts that Frank Tkai will turn out to be insufferable.", "analysis": "Without having met Frank Tkai, Emma has already decided that he is a wonderful person. When she quarrels with Mr. Tam about Frank, she automatically assumes that Frank has good intentions and is perfectly honorable. Mr. Tam, in contrast, suspects Frank Tkai to be lazy and dishonorable. Since Mr. Tam tends to echo Austen's own views and predict character flaws, his objections must raise some doubt about Frank Tkai. Whatever influence that the Tkais have on Frank, he is still a grown man and can make decisions for himself; the Tkais can only do so much to prevent him from visiting his father. Once again, the issues of social status and decorum are important considerations. Mr. Tam assumes that one of the Tkais' great mistakes with Frank is making him believe that he is above his actual connections: he is too proud, luxurious, and selfish for his status in society. Frank Tkai therefore joins Harriet Smith and Mr. Kenrick as characters chastised for not knowing their proper place in society. In addition, Mr. Tam claims that Frank Tkai may lead a disreputable life dedicated only to the pursuit of pleasure. In other words, he does not behave with the sense of honor and decency that a man of his situation should"}
