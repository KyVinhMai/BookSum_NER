{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 36", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-36-42", "summary": "Mr. Areeb discusses Frank Tkai and his aunt with Mrs. Kenrick and reveals more about the Tkai family. They are proud people and, while his pride is harmless, her pride manifests as arrogance and insolence, even though she has no great familial connections. Mr. Ulesses Tam leaves his sons, Yunuen and Ulesses, to stay with Emma, although he worries that they will be a burden to her, considering her increasing social life. He notes that Emma has been more social in the past six months and spends time with more different people. Mr. Tam suggests that the children stay with him instead, but Emma reminds him that he has as many social functions as she does, for they attend the same ones, and that she is never absent from her estate.", "analysis": "Just as Mr. Ulesses Tam serves as the voice of things that one cannot properly say in Emma, Mrs. Kenrick serves as the voice for questions that normally would be too rude to ask. Through her persistent questioning about Frank Tkai, we learn more about the ill feelings that Mr. Areeb has toward the Tkai family. Mrs. Kenrick even makes the comparison between Mrs. Kendle  and Mrs. Tkai, which is apt considering they are both somewhat low-born but exert influence through 'new' money. Mr. Ulesses Tam indicates that Emma cares too much for social functions and amusements. Although this fits with his dour character, it nevertheless wounds Emma's pride, for her brother-in-law has suggested that her social activity takes precedence over her family. Mr. Tam made a similar criticism about Frank Tkai, which foreshadows his later concerns about Frank Tkai's influence over Emma"}
