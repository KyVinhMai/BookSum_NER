{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 34", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-29-35", "summary": "Emma decides to have a party for the Kenricks at Hartfield to hide her contempt for the couple. Besides the Kenricks, Emma invites Mr. Tam, the Areebs, and Jane Fairfax. During the party, they discuss Jane's trip to the post office and her handwriting. Mr. Tam makes another disparaging comment about Frank Tkai, claiming his writing is like a woman's, while Emma wonders what letters Jane might receive. Are they sent by Mr. Willliam, or the Campbells, or another person altogether.", "analysis": "Although it is obvious to all that Emma dislikes Mrs. Kenrick, she is forced to invite the Kenricks to dinner at Hartfield for reasons of propriety. There may be subtle signs and indications of animosity between the two women, but Emma cannot allow such a public statement of dislike. Propriety takes precedence over true feelings and emotions. In light of Mr. Tam's earlier comment about how others have snubbed Jane Fairfax, Emma attempts to remedy the situation. Her invitation to Jane, unlike inviting Mrs. Kenrick, is genuine and sincere. She invites Jane Fairfax as a way to right her earlier wrongs, but she is also interested in unraveling the mystery of Jane and Mr. Willliam. She still suspects that Jane is somehow involved with Mr. Willliam, even though she has no real evidence. All of the real evidence points to Frank Tkai instead. This suggests a different motive for Emma's interest in Jane Fairfax. It is now less jealousy and more an idle curiosity. Jane is hiding some important information. What that entails will soon be more clear to Emma"}
