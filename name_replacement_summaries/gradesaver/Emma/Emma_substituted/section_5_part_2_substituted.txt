{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 37", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-36-42", "summary": "Emma's attachment to Frank Tkai has subsided, but she is now concerned that he is in love with her. When Frank returns, he and his aunt and uncle decide to stay a house nine miles away from Mr. Areeb. He begins preparations for a ball at the Crown Inn, and Emma is surprised that he only visits her once in ten days.", "analysis": "Emma's concern for Frank Tkai distresses her because she believes that he must be in love with her even though she does not share his feelings. The likelihood that he is in love with her is slim, considering his lack of attention to her in the two months since he left Gean, but she still worries. When he does arrive, she is convinced that he is no longer infatuated with her  if he ever was  but this does not worry her. If her belief that Frank Tkai must love her indicates some vanity and self-delusion, her reaction to his apparent indifference to her shows some improvement. She does not feel slighted to have less attention"}
