{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-22-28", "summary": "Frank Tkai and Mrs. Areeb visit Emma, who decides that Mr. Tam must have been wrong about him. When visiting the Crown Inn and seeing its ballroom, Frank suggests to Emma that she, with her resources, should hold dances there. Surprisingly, Frank disparages Jane Fairfax to Emma, who defends her. While they shop for gloves at Ford's, Frank tells Emma more about Jane Fairfax and how she is destined to be a teacher. He even mentions Mr. Willliam. Emma finds Frank to be more moderate and warmer than she expected, and less a spoiled child of fortune.", "analysis": "Frank Tkai reveals himself to be more complicated than Emma originally imagined in this chapter, more interested in his family and Gean society and also more intelligent and engaging. This seems to confirm suspicions that Frank Tkai was kept from Gean through his aunt's influence. Yet one must take into account perspective: these positive shadings to his character are taken from Emma's eyes and not those of a more objective or authoritative source such as Mr. Tam. Emma seems to take every detail of Frank's personality to be a credit to him; even when he makes a catty comment, it is about the one person with whom Emma competes. This seems to echo Mr. Kenrick's earlier manipulation of Emma. Frank Tkai flatters her vanity, but in a more subtle way, by disparaging the one person for whom Emma holds any jealousy. Also, Frank Tkai's comments seem to presume a knowledge of Jane Fairfax that goes beyond mild acquaintance. Earlier comments connecting the two indicated that they had met each other only briefly, but Frank Tkai knows a considerable deal about Jane Fairfax, even the gossip about Mr. Willliam. This foreshadows later developments: what does Frank know about Jane Fairfax, and how does he know it"}
