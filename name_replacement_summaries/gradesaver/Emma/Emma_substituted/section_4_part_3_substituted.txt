{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 31", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-29-35", "summary": "Emma has no doubt that she is in love but wonders how much she can actually love Frank Tkai if she is no less happy during his absence. She realizes that she is not in love to her vow never to marry or quit her father. Emma starts to wonder if Frank might instead be a good match for Harriet. Emma scolds Harriet for worrying about Mr. Kenrick, claiming that it is a constant reminder of her mistake. She asks Harriet to speak less of Mr. Kenrick for her own sake, and Harriet apologies for being ungrateful.", "analysis": "After Emma has opened herself to the idea of falling in love with Frank Tkai , she realizes that she does not truly love him. Her realization shows a practical reasoning and introspection previously uncharacteristic of Emma. Still, although she does not love Frank Tkai, she still enjoys his attention. It bolsters her own very high self-regard to know that a man such as Frank is so attentive to her. However, Emma continues to make the same errors that caused her so much aggravation earlier in the book. She has not learned the lesson of Mr. Kenrick and fancies the idea of making a match between Frank Tkai and Harriet. She knows the dangers of such thinking and actions but is inordinately tempted. What Emma does realize with regard to Harriet Smith is how unfortunately obsessive she can be with regards to Mr. Kenrick. This vexes Emma for a number of reasons. It is a reminder of Emma's mistake in judgment, and, in talking about Mr. Kenrick, Harriet does not serve her primary purpose to Emma. Harriet is useful by flattering Emma, and, in this situation, she annoys. The situation is only remedied when Harriet apologizes and resumes her role as the obedient, dutiful friend"}
