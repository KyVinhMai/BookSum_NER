{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-8-14", "summary": "Emma decides that Mr. George Knightley must dine with them upon his brother's visit, as a means for reconciliation over their argument about Harriet and Mr. Martin. Although Emma has no plans to concede the argument, she wishes to restore their friendship. Isabella mentions Jane Fairfax in conversation, claiming that only she could be as accomplished and superior as Emma, a more suitable companion than Harriet Smith.", "analysis": "Despite Emma's numerous faults, she has a near-faultless sense of politeness and decorum. She will not admit that she was wrong concerning Harriet Smith and Robert Martin, but her stubbornness is not enough to stand in the way of her friendship with Mr. Knightley. Interestingly, Austen points out that Emma is not as worldly as she would like to believe. While Isabella and her husband travel a great deal, Emma admits that she has never even seen the ocean. Her father never travels, which is to be expected considering his anxiety over his health, but it is peculiar that Emma never leaves Highbury, when there are numerous instances when other characters do travel often. Perhaps Emma never leaves Highbury because there is no need: she has everything she desires there. This chapter is also significant for the mention of Jane Fairfax, whose talents and bearing make her a continual aggravation to Emma. Austen contrasts the ideal Jane Fairfax, who would be Emma's intellectual match, with Harriet Smith, who will only flatter Emma. Significantly, only Mr. Woodhouse, who refuses to think badly of his daughter under any circumstances, thinks that Harriet is a perfect friend for Emma"}
