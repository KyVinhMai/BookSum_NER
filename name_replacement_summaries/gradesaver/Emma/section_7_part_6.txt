{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 55", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-50-55", "summary": "Harriet writes to Emma about Robert Martin and admits that she was silly to consider Mr. Knightley. Harriet has learned the truth about her parents: her father was a respectable tradesman who could provide for her stay at Mrs. Goddard's school. Emma meets Robert Martin and becomes convinced that Harriet will be happy with him. Harriet marries Robert Martin, Frank Churchill marries Jane Fairfax, and later, after Mr. Woodhouse is placated, Emma marries Mr. Knightley.", "analysis": "Everything is set right in this chapter: Harriet becomes a respectable member of society when she learns of her family connections and finds happiness with Robert Martin. She is, as Emma had hoped, from a decent family and can now enter society without any undue suspicion. Not surprisingly, Mr. Woodhouse becomes supportive of his daughter's marriage when he realizes that it will benefit his own comfort. He agrees to the marriage after a string of robberies because he thinks that Mr. Knightley's presence at Hartfield will keep him safe. Emma herself finally fulfills Austen's expectations and is married to Mr. Knightley. Upon her marriage, she is set to leave Highbury for a vacation to the ocean, the first instance in the novel in which she leaves her home. If Emma has conceded some of her independence to Mr. Knightley and allowed herself to be less than the center of attention, she has opened herself to new experiences and the possibility of a life in which things remain acceptably beyond her control"}
