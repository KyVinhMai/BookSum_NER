{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-8-14", "summary": "Mr. John and Mrs. Isabella Knightley visit her father and sister at Hartfield. They discuss Frank Churchill, noting that he has not yet visited the Westons since they have been married. When discussing the Westons, Mr. John Knightley reminds Emma that she is not a wife, and says that few think highly of the Churchill family. Emma dislikes her brother-in-law and wishes to contradict him, thinking that his comments reflect badly on Mr. Weston. Yet, she holds her tongue for the sake of her sister and keeping the peace.", "analysis": "John Knightley's pointed remark about Emma's marital status is yet another reminder that Emma has more power as a single woman than a married one. While Emma often seems petty and self-centered in her dealings with Harriet Smith and Mr. Knightley, here she reveals herself to be more honorable, letting her brother-in-law's rude comments about Mr. Weston's social activities pass in order to keep the peace. She behaves with propriety. This interaction also confirms Austen's use of manners to define the value of each character. The first descriptions of Mr. John Knightley and his wife mention their manners. While Isabella's manners are acceptable, her husband's are too reserved to be pleasing, and he is too judgmental towards other's behavior. He criticizes Frank Churchill for qualities without possibly knowing whether he possesses these negative qualities. This chapter also returns to the story of Frank Churchill, foreshadowing that he will soon play an important place in the novel. The fact that he has not yet visited his father since his marriage is presented as an affront to propriety. However, since there is every indication that he has proper manners, there must be a reason that why he has not visited Highbury"}
