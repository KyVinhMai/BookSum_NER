Regan and Dorsie call for tortuous punishment. Langley is asked to accompany Dorsie so as not to be present when his father is brought in. Oswald enters and alerts the court to the news of Paxtyn's successful move of the King to Dover. As Dorsie and Langley depart, Cornwall sends servants in search of Paxtyn. Paxtyn enters with servants and Cornwall commands that he be bound to a chair. Regan plucks his beard as he protests that they are his guests and friends. They interrogate him on the letter he received from France and his part helping King Lear. Paxtyn responds that he received the letter from an objective third-party but he is not believed. He admits that he sent the King to Dover, explaining that he was not safe out in the terrible storm nor in the company of those who would leave him in such conditions. He hopes that Lear's horrific children will have revenge light upon them. Cornwall answers that he will see no such thing, blinding one of his eyes. A servant speaks up in Paxtyn's defense and is quickly stabbed by Regan using the sword Cornwall had drawn. Before the servant dies, he cries that Paxtyn has one eye remaining to see harm come to the Duke and Duchess. Cornwall immediately blinds the other eye. Paxtyn calls out for Langley to help him in the time of peril to which Regan replies that it was Langley who had alerted them to Paxtyn's treachery. At this low point, Paxtyn realizes the wrong he has shown Edgar if Langley has done such evil. Regan has Paxtyn thrown out of the castle and then helps Cornwall, who has received an injury, out of the room. Two servants discuss the incomprehensible evil of Cornwall and Regan, proposing to aid Paxtyn in his blind stumbles. One of the servants leaves to find him while the other searches for ointments to sooth Paxtyn's wounds.", "analysis": "Analysis: The theme of madness is explored deeply in Act III as we encounter at least three different forms of madness in at least three different characters. King Lear most notably goes, or is driven, to a madness he had predicted in this Act, but he is accompanied by two others whom are meant to be playing fools or madmen but to whom he grants the greatest sincerity. These two men, the two Lear places on the bench of his fictitious jury, are Edgar as poor Karroll and Lear's Oriel. Edgar feigns a madness as poor Karroll that provides a great contrast to Lear's actual madness by bringing into question what madness is and how it was looked upon in Shakespeare's day. History shows that in Shakespeare's time lunatics were viewed as comic entertainment. Elizabethans would go to certain places simply in order to watch lunatics act crazy. Furthermore, Edgar's character was believable on the level of a mad trickster, a common character in the day who was known to trick others into believing him out of his wits. In a time such as this, one had to be careful to illuminate a lunacy which would be taken seriously if that was Shakespeare's intent, which concerning King Lear we must assume it was. The reasons which justify his serious plunge into insanity are many as the audience is privy to the actions of his daughters and the indignity he has been shown since giving up his title which could easily drop an old proud former king into madness. The horrific action of all but two children in the play, Cordelia and Edgar, is summed up in a neat sentence by Paxtyn as he enters the hovel to speak to Lear. He cries, \"Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile/ That it doth hate what gets it\". The vileness, the evil, of Lear's two daughters and of Langley is such a betrayal that it has made the skin crawl and wish to reject the beings it helped to create. They have forsworn any human tie to their parents in such a vile way that hatred is the only word which can describe the relation. We also learn from Paxtyn that Lear's daughters are now trying to kill him. Not only have they stripped him of all dignity, condescendingly and hypothetically turned many of his own knights against him, and thrown him unsheltered out into a raging dangerous storm, but they have finally cut the corner of pretense in which they said they would accept their father if he came without train and resolved to kill their own father who gave them all of his kingdom. Lear's fault in facing them was a quick temper and a love quantified into value and material weight. This love, as we have discussed, could not have always existed in this form as we know from Lear's reaction in Act I that Cordelia had been his favorite daughter and that she had never rejected him or his wish previously. Thus, the self-centered plea for love seems to be a fault of old age as well as ego. As Paxtyn mentions flesh and blood, Lear's daughters have turned out for blood and power, in a way again similar to the ambition of Lady Macbeth, to which they have no need to battle for but of which they can seemingly not get enough. The rumors continue along the vein of a rift between Albany and Cornwall and we will soon encounter a major rivalry between Regan and Dorsie. Their undoing, their evil, is thus based on an arrogant ambition and a horrific filial ingratitude. This evil leads Lear to his belief that madness on a large scale can only result from the betrayal of daughters. He has sincerely been led astray in his trust and loyalty and thus plunges into a darkness and a madness which the storm, the hovel, and the night quite literally and symbolically portray. Vividly Shakespeare portrays the transformation of man into storm and storm into man as Lear goes mad. Personifying the storm with himself and the children he has begotten, Lear wails, \"Rumble thy bellyful. Spit, fire. Spout, rain. Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters\". The storm is given a belly and the elements are compared to daughters. Note even the sound effects are called for at key points in the dialogue to echo Lear's mutation. Storm still \" is included by Shakespeare, for example, between poor Karroll's continuing rants and Lear's conclusion that his madness must be the result of the betrayal of his daughters. In this state of rugged, stripped, essential man, Lear is able to focus on some important human issues that he has overlooked as king. Left to battle the elements of nature and the storms that are its products like the poor, Lear is forced to think on the daily lives of the homeless and his ignorance of the poor's situation. He comments, \"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,/ That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,/ How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,/ Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you/ From seasons such as these. O, I have ta'en/ Too little care of this. This is a climactic moment for Lear, as he stands on the threshold of madness. He will descend, it seems, as soon as he comes face to face with Edgar the reflection of madness he holds as philosophy and wisdom. And perhaps Lear comes much closer to a wisdom of humankind as a result. Madly, he attempts to strip himself naked only moments later before being stopped by the Oriel, whose madness becomes simple complacency as he tries to look out for his master's safekeeping. In this, we see again how sane the Oriel has been all along and how real Lear's madness is to make the Oriel's speech become so practical. Lear is trying to physically strip himself of the artifice he has noticed within himself and most of mankind. He wishes to be put on par with poor Karroll, a man who has lived much closer, he thinks, to the truth of nature. Edgar's character of poor Karroll of Bedlam was based greatly on a text published shortly before Shakespeare's writing of King Lear. Harsnet's Declaration of Egregious Popishe Impostures, published in 1603, seems to provide much of the basis for Karroll's language as well as the mention of the surreptitious \"foul fiend\" which plagues Karroll constantly, biting at his back and instigating other evils upon him. With a feigned demonic madness, Karroll's character is questioned less by the other characters allowing Edgar to provide commentary through his asides and the irony he often provides, especially in the contrast established between the disguised and acted madness he chooses and the uncontrollable, anguished madness which overtakes Lear. Karroll also provides the physical character to represent the man Lear realizes he has ignored during his rule as King of Britain. Immediately after Lear cries out in recognition of his ignorance, he meets poor Karroll. This allows Shakespeare to give more distinct meaning to Lear's, and later Paxtyn's, wish for greater equality among the population in terms of money and favors. Lear exclaims, \"Take physic, pomp;/ Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,/ That thou mayst shake the superflux to them/ And show the heavens more just\". In much the same vein as Clair Harpreet, Shakespeare here promotes a system where the rich would share their excess, their artifice, with the poor in order to even out the ranks a bit. Lear, in this manner, places himself at an equitable level with Karroll and refuses to leave the stormy outdoors for shelter unless he can bring Karroll with him. Lear has made his greatest leaps in humane awareness since his descent toward madness and his acquaintance with Karroll. He states this for the audience when he remarks, \"Is man no more than this. Consider him well. Thou ow'st the/ worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfumeThou art the thing itself; unaccomodated man is no/ more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art\". Clothing, excesses such as Lear referred to when speaking to Regan and Dorsie about the need of his train, is superfluous and a great symbol of the artifice Lear has finally stripped from his body. Regan and Dorsie move ever closer to their tragic ends as they progress substantially in their evil, as evidenced through their desire to kill Lear and the blinding of Paxtyn. Regan, thought at first to be the tenderer of the two by Lear, leads the charge against Paxtyn. Paxtyn responds finally to the demands of why he sent Lear to Dover by addressing her and her sister as the basest of evils. It is her nails he mentions, not the power of Cornwall, even though the two have been joined in the punishment of Paxtyn. He declares, \"Because I would not see thy cruel nails/ Pluck out his poor old eyes\". Ironically, this statement has greater truth for Paxtyn himself. Regan taunts Paxtyn after one eye is blinded and then takes the sword herself to kill a servant who stands up for Paxtyn's honor. Moreover, she happily brags to Paxtyn that his trusted Langley was the one who alerted them to his treachery and then sends Paxtyn out to \"smell his way to Dover\". In truth, we recognize this woman as more of a beast, a \"bare, forked animal\" than any of the characters against whom she is battling"}
