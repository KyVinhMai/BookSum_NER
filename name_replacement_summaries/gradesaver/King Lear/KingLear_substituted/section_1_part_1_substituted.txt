Langley speaks with the courtier, Curan, who advises him that Regan and Cornwall will arrive shortly at Paxtyn's castle. He also passes on the gossip that there may soon be a war between Cornwall and Albany. After Curan leaves, Langley expresses his delight over the news he has learned as he can use that in his plot. Edgar enters and Langley cleverly asks if he has offended Cornwall or Albany. Edgar says he has not. Langley cries that he hears Paxtyn coming and forces Edgar to draw his sword with him. Telling Edgar to flee, Langley then wounds himself with his sword before calling out to Paxtyn for help. Paxtyn arrives quickly and sends servants to chase down the villain. Langley explains that he would not allow Edgar to persuade him into murdering their father causing Edgar to slash him with his sword. He continues that Edgar threatened him and by no means intended to permit Langley, an \"unpossessing bastard\", to stop him from his evil plot. Paxtyn is indignant and claims that Edgar will be captured and punished. He promises that Langley will become the heir of his land. At this point, Cornwall and Regan enter the scene, wondering if the gossip they had heard about Edgar is correct. Paxtyn confirms it is. Langley cleverly confirms Regan's fear that Edgar was acting as part of Lear's riotous knights. Cornwall acknowledges the good act Langley has done for Paxtyn and promises to take him into their favor. After Paxtyn and Langley thank them, Regan explains why she and Cornwall have come to Paxtyn's castle. She had received a letter from Dorsie and so had left home to avoid Lear. She asks for Paxtyn's assistance", "analysis": ""}
