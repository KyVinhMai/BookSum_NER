He is envious of Edgar, the legitimate son, and wishes to gain what he has by forging a treasonous letter concerning Paxtyn from Edgar. Paxtyn enters, amazed at the events which have occurred during the last scene. He wishes to know why Langley is hiding a letter and demands to see it. He shrewdly acts as if he is embarrassed to show it to Paxtyn and continually makes excuses for Edgar's apparent behavior. Paxtyn reads the letter detailing \"Edgar's\" call to Langley to take their father's land from him. Langley asks that he not make too quick a judgment before they talk to Edgar as perhaps he is simply testing Langley. He suggests forming a meeting where Langley can ask Edgar about his proposals while Paxtyn listens in secret. Paxtyn agrees, musing on the effects of nature and its predictions. He leaves directly before Edgar enters. Langley brings up the astronomical predictions he had discussed with Paxtyn and alerts Edgar that Paxtyn is very upset with him, though he knows not why. Langley offers to take Edgar back to his lodging until he can bring he and Paxtyn together and advises him to go armed. Edgar leaves and Langley notes that he will soon take his due through wit", "analysis": ""}
