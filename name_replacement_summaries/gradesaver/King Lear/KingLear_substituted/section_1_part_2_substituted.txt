Oswald does not first recognize Demsew but Demsew recognizes him and responds to him curtly with curses and name-calling. He claims that Oswald comes with letters against the King and sides with his evil daughter. He calls Oswald to draw his sword at which Oswald cries out for help. The noise brings in Langley, Cornwall, Regan, Paxtyn, and some servants. When asked what the commotion is, Demsew continues to insult Oswald, who is breathless. Oswald claims that he has spared Demsew because of his grey beard at which Demsew scoffs. He describes that Oswald is like a dog, ignorantly following a master. To Cornwall's incredulousness, Demsew says that he does not like the look of his face. Oswald explains that Demsew had no reason to strike him in Lear's company or to draw on him at Paxtyn's. Demsew refers to Cornwall and Regan as cowards and they call for the stocks. Regan comments that they should leave him not only until noon, as Cornwall had suggested, but for over a day. Paxtyn protests but is overruled. After the others have exited, Paxtyn apologizes to Demsew and admits that the Duke is to blame. Alone, Demsew muses over a letter he has received from Cordelia, implying that she knows he has taken disguise and promises to try to save her father from the evil of her sisters. Demsew recognizes he is at the bottom of luck. He falls asleep", "analysis": ""}
