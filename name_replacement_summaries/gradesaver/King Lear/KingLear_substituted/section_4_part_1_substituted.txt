Regan approaches Langley, sweetly asking him if he loves her sister and if he has ever found his way into her bed. He replies that though he loves in \"honored love\" he has done nothing adulterous or to break their vow. Warning him to stay away from Dorsie, Regan threatens that she will not put up with her sister's entreaties to him. Dorsie and Albany enter as Dorsie tells the audience that her battle for Langley is more important to her than the battle with France. Albany informs Regan of Cordelia and Lear's reunion. Regan wonders why he brings up the subject of the King and his grievances. Dorsie points out that they must join together against France and ignore their personal conflicts. As the two camps separate, Regan pleads with Dorsie to accompany her instead of the other camp where Langley will be present. Dorsie refuses at first but then sees Regan's purpose and agrees. Edgar finds Albany alone and asks him to read the letter to Langley from Dorsie he had intercepted. Though he cannot stay while Albany reads it, he prays him to let the herald cry when the time is right and he will appear again. Albany leaves to read it when Langley reenters to report of the oncoming enemy. In soliloquy, Langley wonders what he will do about pledging his love to both sisters. He could take both of them, one, or neither. He decides to use Albany while in battle and after winning, to allow Dorsie to kill him. Moreover, he plans to forbid any mercy Albany may show Cordelia and Lear because his rule of the state is his highest priority", "analysis": ""}
