Oswald points out that Dorsie is the better soldier and informs Regan that Langley did not have a chance to speak with Albany. Regan asks what the letter which Oswald brought from Dorsie for Langley says but Oswald knows only that it must be of great importance. Regan regrets blinding Paxtyn because allowing him to live arouses sympathy which results in more parties turned against Regan and her company. Stating that Langley has gone in search of Paxtyn to put him out of his misery, she then claims that he is checking out the strength of the enemy forces. She urges Oswald to remain with her because the roads are dangerous. She is jealous of what she fears the contents of the letter may be, namely entreaties to Langley for his love. Advising him to remind Langley of the matters he had discussed with her considering their marriage, Regan allows Oswald to continue. Oswald agrees to halt Paxtyn if he comes upon him and thus show to whom his loyalty lies", "analysis": ""}
