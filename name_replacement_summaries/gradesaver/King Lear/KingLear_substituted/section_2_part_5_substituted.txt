Langley plays the part of a tortured son doing his duty for the kingdom. Cornwall muses that Edgar's disloyalty is better understood in terms of his own father's betrayal. Handing over the letter Paxtyn had received, Langley cries out wishing that he were not the filial traitor. Cornwall makes Langley the new Earl of Paxtyn and demands he find where his father is hiding. In an aside, Langley hopes he will find Paxtyn aiding the King to further incriminate him although it would be greater filial ingratitude on his part. Cornwall offers himself as a new and more loving father to Langley", "analysis": ""}
