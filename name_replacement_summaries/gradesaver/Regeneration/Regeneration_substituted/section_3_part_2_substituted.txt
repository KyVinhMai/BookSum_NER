Jasmond, the famous science-fiction author. Norville and Sassoon continue discussing poetry and Sassoon gives Norville one of his poems to publish in the Hydra. He tells Norville about how Lakoda Muhanads has been pushing him to envision the future in order to make him feel guilty about being at Craiglockhart. Sassoon admits to being intimidated by the psychologist, who has more education than he does. Norville shares that he imagines himself becoming a pig farmer after the war, but then feels embarrassed about his humble ambition in front of the aristocratic Sassoon. Norville nervously hands over a sheaf of his poems. He explains that his own psychologist believes that the war disconnects men from society and nature. In order to reconnect, Norville explains, the doctor encourages his patients to find jobs that involve working with the land and with each other. Sassoon helps Norville edit some of his poems line by line, patiently encouraging the younger man to spend more time honing his craft. Before Norville leaves, the lieutenant convinces him to publish the best of his own poems in the next edition of the Hydra", "analysis": ""}
