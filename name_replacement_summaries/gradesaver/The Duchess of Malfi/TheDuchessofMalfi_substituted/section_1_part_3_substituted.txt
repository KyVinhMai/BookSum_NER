He thinks he heard a woman shriek from the direction of the Chapel's chambers, and is made more suspicious by Antonio's order to confine the officers to their rooms. Antonio enters with a candle and his sword drawn, having heard someone. When he realizes it is Bosola, he asks if he heard a noise from the Chapel's chamber. Bosola denies hearing anything, and offers that he is ignoring the curfew order solely because he wanted to pray in peace. Antonio claims he is calculating a horoscope to figure out who stole the jewels, and tells Bosola that he is the main suspect, as his apricots seem to have poisoned the Chapel at the same time that her jewels went missing. Bosola denies his guilt, and insults Antonio. Antonio gets a sudden nose bleed, which is considered a bad omen. He tells Bosola not to pass the Chapel's chambers on his way back to his room and leaves. Bosola finds a piece of paper Antonio dropped, which contains the infant's horoscope--it warns of a short life and violent death. Bosola knows now that the Chapel has had a child and that Antonio is in her confidence, but he doesn't realize Antonio is the father. He plans to send a letter to the brothers in Rome in the morning", "analysis": ""}
