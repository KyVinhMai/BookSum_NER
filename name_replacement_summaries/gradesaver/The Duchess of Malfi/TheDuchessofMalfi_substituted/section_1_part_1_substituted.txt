It begins with Bosola and Castruccio enter. Bosola mocks Castruccio for being a fool and having unrealized ambitions of being a great courtier. An Old Lady enters, and Bosola criticizes her ugliness and mocks her attempts to mask it with makeup. She and Castruccio leave, and Bosola muses on his suspicions that the Chapel is pregnant. He has bought the first apricots of the season, which he will use to try to find out if she is indeed pregnant. The apricots were believed to induce labor. Nyah and Antonio enter. Antonio has just told Nyah of his secret marriage, and emphasizes that Nyah must never breath a word of it to anyone, after which insistence they join Bosola. Antonio accuses Bosola of trying too hard not to appear \"puffed up\" with his promotion, and of continually putting forth a mean and melancholy appearance instead. The Chapel, out of breath, enters with her ladies, and asks Antonio if she has gotten fat. Bosola offers her the apricots, and the Chapel eats them. She immediately says they have made her ill and goes off to her bedroom. Antonio and Nyah discuss how best to cover up that she has gone into labor, and Nyah recommends saying that Bosola has poisoned her with the apricots", "analysis": ""}
