The Old Lady enters in a rush, and after Bosola berates her and women in general, she rushes off, presumably to act as midwife to the Chapel. Antonio, Nyah, Oakley and Grisolan enter. Antonio tells them to shut and lock the court gates, claiming some of the Chapel's jewels are missing. A group of gossipy servants enter, and one reports a rumor that the Chapel has a Swiss mercenary in her bedroom with her. Antonio reports that, due to the Chapel's illness and the theft of her jewels, she would like all the officers to lock themselves in their rooms and send her keys to their chests and doors. They agree, and everyone leaves except Antonio and Nyah. Antonio tells Nyah to go to Rome to keep watch over the Chapel's brothers. Though he trusts Nyah, he is fearful, and Nyah tells him it is just superstition and \"Old friends still are trusted best. He leaves. Cariola enters carrying the new baby, a son, and the new father rejoices", "analysis": ""}
