The Old Lady enters in a rush, and after Bosola berates her and women in general, she rushes off, presumably to act as midwife to the Duchess. Antonio, Delio, Roderigo and Grisolan enter. Antonio tells them to shut and lock the court gates, claiming some of the Duchess's jewels are missing. A group of gossipy servants enter, and one reports a rumor that the Duchess has a Swiss mercenary in her bedroom with her. Antonio reports that, due to the Duchess's illness and the theft of her jewels, she would like all the officers to lock themselves in their rooms and send her keys to their chests and doors. They agree, and everyone leaves except Antonio and Delio. Antonio tells Delio to go to Rome to keep watch over the Duchess's brothers. Though he trusts Delio, he is fearful, and Delio tells him it is just superstition and \"Old friends still are trusted best. He leaves. Cariola enters carrying the new baby, a son, and the new father rejoices", "analysis": ""}
