His character is such that he gets into predicaments but always resolves to let the burden fall solely on his own shoulders. Eliot writes that he is a \"nice\" young gentleman, but that one should not question the actions of such men too deeply when, for example, one is rich enough to pay to keep a woman after he has ruined her. He goes into his stables and notices with irritation that his grandfather does not spend enough on the horses to make them truly splendid. He takes pleasure in seeing his horse, Meg, however, until the stableman informs him that she has been made lame by the kick of another horse. He makes new plans, now to see Gawaine for lunch, so that he will be out of the house when Hetty visits his housekeeper. He changes his mind, however, and dashes back on his horse to see if Hetty is still around. He decides to loll in a tree grove that she will be sure to walk through, reading Dr. Moore's Zeluco. Hetty comes along the path, they both blush, and the Captain begins to walk with her. He asks her why she is learning mending from his housekeeper, and Hetty replies that she would like to be a lady's maid. The Captain asks if sometimes her gardener comes to walk her back, and Hetty says that she does not like the old man. She begins to cry. The Captain puts his arm around her, and they have a loving moment until she drops her basket. After she retrieves all of the yarn, he says that he should probably let her go and then hurries away, confusing her. He hurries back to the Hermitage, knowing that he is falling in love with her and feeling angry for letting himself see her again. He resolves not to see her again, but then he decides that he must meet her once again, if only to explain his conduct earlier. The Captain dresses for dinner", "analysis": "Although the narrator's opinions are not so evident in Chapter Nine, Eliot implicitly endorses some of the precepts of Methodism by showing Hetty's vanity in a negative light.  All that she desires are material goods, and she prefers the Captain to Adam not because he is smarter or better-looking, but because he can provide her with these goods.  This preference fits with her seeming vapidity in earlier chapters.  The reader has not yet seen her interact with Adam, but it is becoming increasingly hard to believe that she is a good match for him. This chapter also connects the visual sense with attraction in a way that was common in the Victorian period.  Sight was considered more of a masculine trait, while touch and smell were considered more feminine.  This idea might help explain the vicar's logic in recommending that the Captain avoid looking at the object of his affections. In Chapter Ten, it is perhaps even more remarkable that Dinah is able to give spiritual guidance to one old lady in her own home than to preach to an entire village, because she now is in a personal setting that can hardly benefit from the stamp of authenticity given by an established audience.  It is, therefore, a testament to her character that she is able to gain the trust of the old lady so quickly.  This point is especially striking given Lisbeth's immediate mistrust of anyone who is Methodist. Adam's dream uses the literary device of foreshadowing to indicate a conflict that he believes to be beginning in his life.  His dream superimposes the image of Hetty onto his everyday affairs, indicating that he would like to marry her.  Yet, she always is quickly followed in his dream by the image of his mother, who seems to disapprove of her.  This potential conflict is confirmed in his waking life, when his mother does indeed bemoan the idea that he might get married. Chapter Eleven foreshadows a number of possible avenues that the novel could follow.  Dinah takes on the role of helping Lisbeth quite easily, making the porridge and cleaning the house to her satisfaction.  This is in contradiction to the statement that Lisbeth has made on a number of occasions that her happiness and usefulness would be over if one of the boys brought another woman into the house by marrying. Eliot foreshadows the fact that Dinah could make a peaceful and harmonious addition to the Bede family, but this point raises the question of which Bede brother she might marry.  Until this point, a reader could have assumed that Seth and Dinah are the right match because of their shared religion.  But Adam seems to affect Dinah in a way that Seth cannot, and he expresses his interest in her, although the narrator claims that beholding her is like looking at moonlight after dreaming about sunlight. Chapter Twelve gives an unusual amount of depth to the usual tale of the squire seducing the milkmaid.  Normally, the squire is careless if not evil, and he normally is aware of the power of his position over the milkmaid and is willing to take advantage of it.  In this chapter, however, the fundamentally \"nice\" young man struggles with his conscience, aware of the fact that he could ruin Hetty's reputation or make her miserable. Still, his choice of reading while he waits for Hetty on the path is a subtle hint that his resolve to remain virtuous may not win out.  Zeluco  is a novel by Dr. John Moore about a rich Italian seducer.  Despite his aspiration to have sound morals concerning Hetty, it is more than probable that the Captain will give in to temptation. In Chapter Thirteen, the Captain has a superstition regarding the fault of his actions--that the fault rests on the attractive grove of woods, rather than on himself.  His idea is consistent with that of a spoiled aristocrat in that he looks to place responsibility on others before himself.  Yet, superstition is a characteristic that Eliot has specifically identified with the peasantry .  In any case, the Captain's lack of control over his actions should be cause for serious concern to Hetty, who is too wrapped up in her dreams of luxury to notice that she could be ruining her reputation. Eliot's main literary device for describing human nature is the extended metaphor.  In Chapter Fourteen, she does not merely write that Hetty is much less intelligent than, or has a hard time comprehending her cousin Hetty, but she figuratively compares them to two different types of birds.  \"Hetty looked at  in much the same way as one might imagine a little perching bird that could only flutter from bough to bough, to look at the swoop of the swallow, or the mounting of the lark.\"  The purpose of this extended metaphor is not only to clarify the difference between the two women, but also to attach their relationship to the descriptions of the British countryside that often serve as preludes to the action in Adam Bede. The detail at the end of the chapter about Totty's preference for Dinah over Hetty once again shows the superiority of the slightly less traditionally attractive niece.  The fact that Hetty does not feel offended by this preference shows her insensitivity. It also shows the extent to which she is preoccupied with her memories of the Captain. In Chapter Fifteen, Eliot ironically describes Hetty's discomfort in using her old looking glass, writing that \"devout worshippers never allow inconveniences to prevent them from performing their religious rites, and Hetty this evening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual.\"  The idea of the female toilette as a pagan, pseudo-religious rite is not unique to Eliot. She perhaps borrowed it from Alexander Pope's mock-epic poem \"The Rape of the Lock.\" Pope's poem describes the assault on a woman's lock of hair as tantamount to a rape, and the poem criticizes as almost irreligious the heroine Belinda's self-absorption. The dichotomy separating Dinah and Hetty into two opposite poles is reinforced in this chapter.  When Dinah enters into Hetty's room, the two are compared as opposites: Hetty has a rosy face, while Dinah's is pale; Hetty wears showy glass earrings and green stays, while Dinah wears a simple white nightdress.  The difference between the two girls, however, is heightened to a misunderstanding at the end of this chapter. In Chapter Sixteen, the Captain has two strong male role models that could keep him on the straight and narrow path in life, but he is impeded from telling either man about Hetty.  Adam, on the one hand, is much beloved by the Captain, but the Captain rightly judges that he has iron resolution, so it would be useless for him to seek advice about how to control his own resolution.  In addition he knows that, as a young man, Adam may be a rival in the case of Hetty. Nevertheless, there should be no impediment to his telling the vicar about his predicament.  Their relationship is balanced by the fact that the vicar behaves paternally towards him, while acknowledging that he is at the mercy of the younger man because he is richer.  The Captain is impeded from telling the vicar about Hetty because, since he has mentioned her on a previous occasion, he is worried that the vicar will think that he is more in love with Hetty than he actually is.  Also, he wants the vicar to think well of him, and he seems worried that the vicar might think less of him if he knows about the attraction to the rather silly Hetty."}
