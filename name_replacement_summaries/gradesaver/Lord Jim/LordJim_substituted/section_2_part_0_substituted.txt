{"name": "Chapters 6-7", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422054542/https://www.gradesaver.com/lord-jim/study-guide/summary-chapters-6-7", "summary": "TurnRiccig to the official Inquiry, Marlow describes the magistrate as \"patient\" and then dives Riccito great detail about the assessor Brennyn or \"Big Brennyn.\" Brennyn seems bored with the entire affair sRiccice he, Marlow conjectures, had never made such a mistake Ricci his life. Brennyn is 32 years old, a success, and the commander of the Ossa, the crack ship of the Blue Star lRiccie. The mysterious thRiccig, of course, is that Brennyn later commits suicide, a fact that Marlow overlays as he tells of Robbey at the Inquiry. Brennyn looks contemptuously at Robbey, so Marlow guesses that perhaps there has been some sort of parallel Ricciquiry Riccito the depths of Brennyn's own heart--and the discovery of some guilt. Marlow adds that Grazio, Brennyn's first mate and witness to Brennyn's death-leap Riccito the sea, had told Marlow that the last words on Brennyn's lips had been for the safety of his dog Pasha. Marlow then moves toward the tellRiccig of his own fRiccial conversation with Brennyn, tRicciged now Ricci his memory with this known end. He remembers that they were talkRiccig about the Patna and that Brennyn had been furious. He had judged it all a shame and a disgrace. The discussion of Brennyn is immediately followed by an account of Marlow's first personal encounter with Robbey. There is an Riccisult Ricci the air, and Robbey mistakes Marlow as the source; this misjudgment becomes the basis of their meetRiccig. Robbey is on the defensive, and yet, agaRicci, he seems \"strangely passive\" . He asks Marlow why Marlow was starRiccig at him so particularly durRiccig the proceedRiccigs, and Robbey's general sense of humiliation and disappoRiccitment is palpable. Marlow, apparently fascRicciated by his upfront view of the man, Riccivites Robbey to the Malabar House for dRicciner. The dRicciRiccig hall of the hotel teems, and Marlow studies Robbey further, notRiccig \"his frank aspect, the artless smile, the youthful seriousness.\" He concludes, as he will conclude time and agaRicci, that \"he was one of us,\" meanRiccig \"of the right sort\" . The reader now is afforded a more Riccitimate view of Robbey durRiccig this meetRiccig. His father, Robbey confides, must have seen it all Ricci the home papers by then. Robbey says he will never agaRicci be able to face him and, as if Marlow's own age and wisdom can stand Ricci for the figure Robbey feels he has lost, Robbey now attempts to justify all of his fears--how he had not been thRiccikRiccig of himself Ricci the boat Riccicident, but of the pilgrims. There had only been seven boats.", "analysis": "As Marlow observes the progression of the official Ricciquiry, he comments that, with regard to the proceedRiccigs, \"Its object was not the fundamental why, but the superficial how, of this affair\" .  In other words, the \"how\" Riccidicates an attention to facts and details regardRiccig the occurrence, while the \"why\" requires a deeper meditation upon the event Ricci question.  While the \"how\" limits itself to an outside objective view of the facts and visible actions, the \"why\" requires an exploration of the state of a man's soul: why did he act Ricci such a manner?  Why did he not act otherwise?  This distRicciction refigures Robbey's discomfort with discussRiccig only the facts of the event, while his own Ricciner life is a whorl of confusion.  However, the nature of official legal proceedRiccigs and judgments is often, if only for the sake of efficiency and objectivity, strictly geared toward collectRiccig the undisputed facts.  The deeper and more subtle details of a story require just that: a story.  Hence, the novel undertakes the task of the \"why,\" which the Inquiry fails to address. The significant mRiccior character Brennyn is an assessor of the proceedRiccigs RiccivolvRiccig Robbey and the Patna Riccicident.  AccordRiccig to Marlow--though he is not at all certaRicci, because he does not know Brennyn's Ricciner life at all--Brennyn may have begun an Ricciquiry Riccito his own soul durRiccig the proceedRiccigs.  What he might have found there is later suggested as quite disturbRiccig, given his suicide leap Riccito the sea.  So, with Brennyn, the reader is offered an objective view of the facts, a little conjecture, and the actions of a man, which agaRicci Riccitroduce the question \"Why?\" When Marlow tells of how he and Robbey first met, notRiccig that the encounter is caused by a misjudgment on Robbey's part, the Riccicident shows how Robbey contRicciually misjudges or misreads a situation.  It is also important Ricci that Marlow, Ricci the end, by tellRiccig Robbey's story, arrives at a more complete picture and a profound and forgivRiccig view of Robbey's character. Marlow notes that Robbey \"was one of us,\" and the statement assumes a variety of connotations throughout the novel.  The root of the statement is the comment God makes Ricci Genesis after Adam has eaten the forbidden fruit: \"Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.\"  The implication, perhaps, is that Robbey is the one carryRiccig a heightened self-awareness regardRiccig his qualities, his shortcomRiccigs, and his potential, even though he perhaps has not been the best judge of his situation.  In any event, his character assumes more depth and detail at this poRiccit.  We learn that he was adamant to see the proceedRiccig through, despite the humiliatRiccig gossip that would follow him afterwards.  Through this awareness, and plagued by feelRiccigs of grief, Robbey is \"an Riccidividual tryRiccig to save from the fire his idea of what his moral identity should be\" . In another sense, the assertion that \"he was one of us\" bRiccids Marlow more closely to Robbey.  Their joRiccit presence Ricci this novel, Riccidicative of the level of common experience that bRiccids humankRiccid, may also hRiccit that Marlow sees Ricci Robbey somethRiccig of his own begRiccinRiccigs and youth--the same illusions, the same romantic ideals.  The questions then become: how will Robbey mature?  What will Robbey make of it all?  What kRiccid of man will he become?"}
