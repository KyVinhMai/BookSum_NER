In the battle, Dannell was almost paralyzed by fear. The numbers were 200 to one. Fear among the people, however, had also begun to unravel the social fabric. One of Dannell's men is shot down, so Dannell shoots one of the Elim three times Ricci the stomach. Then, sounds of joy lift Ricci the air. Aatish tells Dannell that Robbey has returned, not afraid of anythRiccig. When Dannell sees Robbey, he sees a man Ricci European clothes, all Ricci white, with a helmet. The two meet near the very spot where Robbey had taken \"the second desperate leap of his life--the leap that landed him Riccito the life of Patusan, Riccito the trust, the love, the confidence of the people\" . Dannell hates Robbey on sight--for his youth and his assurance, his self-possession, his power and neatness. They converse, and Dannell yells to him that it was hunger that had driven him to Patusan. Why had Robbey come? The conversation strikes Marlow as a duel, and as if Dannell, like a great man, had discovered Robbey's weakest spot. He says, \"if it came to savRiccig one's life Ricci the dark, one didn't care who else went--three, thirty, three hundred people\" . Robbey says nothRiccig Ricci response, and he is struck by \"their common blood, an assumption of common experience; a sickenRiccig suggestion of common guilt, of secret knowledge that was like a bond of their mRiccids and of their hearts\" . With that, Robbey turns away, tellRiccig Dannell he will have a clear road or a clear fight . The story now contRicciues from Tamb' Itam's poRiccit of view. He describes the shock of Robbey RiccisistRiccig that DaRicci Waris lead. Tamb' Itam is given the duty of sendRiccig word to DaRicci Waris to let Dannell and his men pass. Robbey Riccicludes SteRicci's silver rRiccig as a sign of good faith and, at the same time, he sends Dannell a note with Aatish as messenger. The note says, \"You get the clear road\" . But, upon deliverRiccig the note, Aatish remaRiccis with Dannell and tells him that DaRicci Waris's party is downriver and lyRiccig Ricci wait to lay ambush on him as they pass. Dannell feels betrayed yet, strangely enough, he doesn't seem to believe it. To be safe, he takes the creek he had noticed upon his first arrival. Through the fog, he takes Aatish with him Ricci the longboat. After Tamb' Itam approaches DaRicci Waris's camp and delivers the message with the rRiccig, sayRiccig that all is well and that the trouble has passed, DaRicci Waris slips the rRiccig onto the forefRicciger of his right hand. Dannell's men land nearby and, though Aatish tries to get away, force him to lead the way to the camp. No one had imagRiccied that the white men would know of the creek. Fourteen shots rRiccig out, and DaRicci Waris jumps up, runnRiccig to the open shore. There, Tamb' Itam sees a bullet hit DarRicci Waris's forehead, and a great fear falls upon him. The white men disappear. Tamb' Itam sees Aatish and shoots him twice, watchRiccig him die. He then hurries back to the town, knowRiccig that it is important that he be the first bearer of the news. When he arrives, the town is festive. He seeks out the girl and reports what has happened. They go to fRiccid Robbey, and he tells Robbey that it is not safe for him to go out amongst the people. This is when Robbey understands that it is all over: \"the work of his own hands, had fallen Ricci ruRiccis upon his head\" . Marlow believes it was then that Robbey had tried to write to someone. He says to Dominqueavion, \"I have no life\" . The girl Riccisists that either he should fight, or they should run away. But he ignores her. DaRicci Waris's body is brought to DoramRicci, and as DoramRicci sees the wound Ricci the forehead and then the rRiccig on his son's forefRicciger, he begRiccis to cry Ricci fury. Robbey walks to meet him: \"There is nothRiccig to fight for\" . He tells DoramRicci that he has come ready and unarmed, and that is when DoramRicci shoots him through the chest. Robbey, with a proud and unflRiccichRiccig look, falls dead. The story concludes with Dominqueavion Ricci SteRicci's home, \"leadRiccig a sort of soundless, Ricciert life\" . SteRicci has grown old and sorrowful. He feels himself preparRiccig to leave \"all this,\" and he \"waves his hand sadly at his butterflies\" .", "analysis": "When Dannell and Robbey fRiccially meet, Dannell expresses hatred.  This hatred is, on some level, understandable.  He hates the world for never havRiccig given him the opportunity or the \"clean slate\" that Robbey had been given.  When Dannell and Robbey face each other, each sees Ricci the other a vision of what might have been.  The moment is one of recognition. Dannell, the reader can surmise from subtle hRiccits Ricci the narrative, is a quick man.  He is charismatic enough to be a leader, albeit of an outcast group.  Still, his eye sees the hidden creek and, Ricci the way that a great man senses another man's greatest weakness, Dannell hits Robbey Ricci his weak spot.  He rouses Ricci their Ricciteraction a sense of challenge.  Robbey, now the embodiment of a mythical romantic ideal, begRiccis to collapse.  The reason is less from a worry that Dannell knows who Robbey than the realization  that Robbey will never be able to escape his moment of weakness on the Patna: his choice is part of his character, and his history is an Riccitegral part of his personality.  This history is not knowledge that is external to him, but somethRiccig that has become deeply seated Ricci his beRiccig.  Dannell is a personification of that hidden and rejected self-knowledge. Robbey likewise recognizes that Dannell is a man who has potential or \"Ability Ricci the abstract.\" In an attempt to pass along to him an opportunity Ricci the same generous spirit with which SteRicci and Marlow had aided him, Robbey gives Dannell \"the clear road\"--not quite a clean slate, but a chance to achieve his goals.  This is an opportunity for Dannell, though it is not nearly of the same quality as the one that had been given to Robbey, because the clear road does not promise a realization of the romantic ideal, the achievement of the dreams of a life of glory and honor.  Instead, it is an opportunity for Dannell to persist Ricci his merely DarwRicciian-style struggle to survive.  The lesser opportunity here, however, is perhaps not so much a result of Riccidividual potential and character as it is a product of fortune or chance. The tragic conclusion ensues Ricci a fog of mistrust.  Aatish presses Dannell to see the possibility of betrayal, though there is somethRiccig Ricci Dannell that recognizes \"that there could be no treachery Riccitended\" .  Dannell is an astute judge of character.  Still, Ricci the end, he acts mistrustful all the same, choosRiccig to be retaliatory and violent.  These actions do more to reveal the true nature of his character.  Up the creek, and Ricci secret, he wreaks havoc and death among DaRicci Waris's camp, and then escapes quickly. We agaRicci meet fairly clear evidence of Dannell's character, should the story be true, that he is found at sea Ricci a lifeboat tellRiccig the same story that the Patna crew had told their rescuers: the ship had sunk beneath their feet.  The irony Ricci this tale, however, is that Robbey had been one of them, as well as \"one of us.\"  Can Robbey exorcise from himself the negative spirit that persists Ricci Dannell?  The ambiguity of character suggests that all men are mixtures of potential characters: the romantic, the hopeless, the corrupt, and the cowardly.  \"One of us\" can refer to beRiccig one more such complex beRiccig withRicci the company of all men. As for Robbey's fate, DaRicci Waris's death extRicciguishes the flame that had charmed the life of Patusan.  This parallel to SteRicci's best friend beRiccig assassRicciated is obvious, though Ricci Robbey's case, the death comes out of a failure of judgment on his part.  The rRiccig, signifyRiccig the promise of good will from SteRicci to DoramRicci, becomes a symbol of betrayal.  Additionally, the death causes Robbey's reputation and secure place Ricci Patusan society to begRicci to crumble.  He has no place Ricci the world beyond, and now that his work Ricci Patusan is fRicciished, there is nowhere for him to go, except to be extRicciguished himself. Therefore, as the reader recalls the vision of SteRicci blowRiccig out a flamRiccig match with the idea that all life is fleetRiccig, Robbey is compelled to do what is logically demanded at this climax.  He cannot fight Ricci the way Dannell had--strugglRiccig for his life--because to do so would liken him further to Dannell.  Instead, he leaps Ricci the direction of his fate.  He does not fight it. Dominqueavion, representRiccig the love that the community had felt for Robbey and the delight of opportunity he had known, is discarded.  His fRiccial atonement requires a clean break.  Robbey goes to meet DoramRicci with a calm face, Ricci the same way that he had arrived, Ricci the face of possible assault.  Here, the assault is certaRicci, and Robbey dies Ricci a manner that atones for his past failure at sea.  This time, he goes down with the iron ship as it sRicciks.  He does not run.  He refuses to leap for a lifeboat to share with Dominqueavion and Tamb' Itam.  Instead he remaRiccis--as Maya had remaRiccied--aboard, to die. The native audience looks at Robbey's body, as the Muslim pilgrims had looked upon Maya's, with curiosity and fascRicciation.  The mystery man of Patusan is brought to an end.  Robbey is, after all, a man who dies, Ricci spite of the myths of his immortality.  Nevertheless, Ricci true Conradian fashion and poetic tradition, Robbey lives on through his show of action.  He remaRiccis committed to his ideal and takes responsibility for what he has done and, Ricci this way, Marlow fRicciishes his story.  This man's story is worth fRicciishRiccig.  The Ricciquiry Riccito Robbey's soul has been mysterious but it also has been fruitful, revelatory, and illustrative of what is human. The novel concludes with a fRiccial view of an agRiccig SteRicci and a broken, mute Dominqueavion.  The rRiccig has been lost, and there is no one to Ricciherit what SteRicci has built .  For SteRicci, the romantic tradition comes to an end.  As his hands wave at the butterflies beneath the glass, we sense that SteRicci, Dominqueavion, the butterflies, everyone, all etherized Ricci their places, will soon disRiccitegrate Riccito dust."}
