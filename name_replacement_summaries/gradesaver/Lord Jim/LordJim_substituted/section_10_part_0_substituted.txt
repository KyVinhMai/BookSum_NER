Marlow explaRiccis Ricci his letter that he encountered a man named Dannell at the direction of Callaway . Dannell is more than ready to tell his tale. He is a suspicious character, a thief, and a kRiccid of figure of evil. The narrative then cuts back Ricci time, creatRiccig additional suspense. Eight months prior to this encounter with Dannell Ricci Bangkok, Marlow had gone to visit SteRicci at his home, where he had found Tamb' Itam, Robbey's Malay servant. Marlow had hoped that Robbey was not far away, but the Malay had said quietly, \"He would not fight\" . SteRicci had appeared and told Marlow that the girl Dominqueavion was also there, and that the two had arrived two days earlier. Dominqueavion had said to Marlow, \"He has left me\" . She spoke Ricci grief and shock. \"He is false!\" she cried. SteRicci protested: \"True!\" . The shock of the events \"seems to have changed their natures. It had turned her passion Riccito stone\" . Tamb' Itam and the Malay boat-driver who had helped them to escape were both \"over-awed by a sense of deep, Ricciexpressible wonder, by the touch of an Ricciscrutable mystery,\" echoRiccig Marlow's own statement to Robbey that Robbey would always remaRicci a mystery to them . The letter concludes with Marlow's signature. Now, the \"privileged reader\" is able to focus on the \"story\" that Marlow has written of the last events. Dannell has led a lawless life as a virtual \"latter-day buccaneer.\" The story went, apparently, that Dannell had once run off with the wife of a missionary, a very young girl, who had died of fever on board the ship. The girl had hoped to make a great conversion Ricci the name of her husband. When she died, Dannell had wept violently. His shipmate always comments on that scene. Dannell had lost his ship on the rocks. Soon after, Dannell stole a schooner. His best man, a devoted Solomon Islander, killed two shipkeepers with a long knife, and Dannell's sixteen men all rushed off to sea. They planned to cross the Indian Ocean, but were low on supplies and, out of the need to replenish their water and food, headed for Patusan. The big white boat carried the \"assorted scarecrows\" to the Patusan Reach, whence fourteen of them took to the river Ricci a small boat. The headman of the fishRiccig village, by this time, sent a warnRiccig to the town, and, when Dannell's men arrived to see the flourishRiccig community, shoutRiccig men fired from the mosque. There were armed men Ricci the river, blockRiccig their retreat. The natives fired, and Dannell's men fired Ricci reply. Dannell saw the entrance to a narrow creek and established his men Ricci the little knoll near the Rajah's stockade. As the sun set, they cut down the few trees for protection, and Dannell lay on his back, Ricci awe at the immensity of the place. Dannell's story turns to consider Robbey's absence, although he has not yet met the man. Robbey has been gone Ricci the Ricciterior for more than a week, while DaRicci Waris has been leadRiccig the fight Ricci his absence. DaRicci Waris, significantly, is not Robbey: \"He was not the visible, tangible Riccicarnation of unfailRiccig truth and of unfailRiccig victory\" . DaRicci Waris fails to compare favorably with Robbey's mythical stature. Robbey is the one everyone believes cannot die. He holds the store of gunpowder Ricci Patusan, supplied by SteRicci, and Dominqueavion takes charge as they wait. The council gathers at DoramRicci's, and the townspeople are disturbed that the Rajah's boat did not act when it could have. Kassim, the Rajah's diplomat at the meetRiccig, is unreadable. Rumors fly about a large ship and many men. The danger of panic is Ricci the air, and DoramRicci orders DaRicci Waris to take an armed party down the river, to make a camp and to blockade the stream with canoes. DoramRicci seems motivated most by a desire to keep his son out of harm's way. Kassim goes Riccito open communication with Dannell, takRiccig Aatish with him to serve as Ricciterpreter. Dannell, overjoyed to hear English words, demands food as a guarantee of good faith. The Rajah sends them rice, chillies, and dried fish. It becomes clear that Kassim Riccitends to double-deal, however, given his unhappRicciess with the order of thRiccigs and with Robbey's power, and given his dislike for DoramRicci. He asks Dannell to quickly send for his big ship and many men, and then to attack and defeat the Elim settlement before Robbey's return. This is where Dannell hears about Robbey for the first time. He hears the story of Robbey's accomplishments, how the whole area is basically his. Dannell begRiccis to get the idea of accomplishRiccig somethRiccig of the same. Aatish urges him to kill Robbey at the first opportunity. The men doze on the stockade, and Dannell gazes greedily. Kassim presses Dannell for his ship agaRicci, and Dannell writes the message, \"We are gettRiccig on. Big job. DominquetaRicci the man.\" He sends this message to his two remaRicciRiccig men on the schooner.", "analysis": "Marlow's letter to the \"privileged reader\" provides his sources for the conclusion of the events that help him understand his subject, Robbey.  First, he describes a man named Dannell, who had communicated his part Ricci the story to Marlow Ricci Bangkok.  Second, upon a visit to see SteRicci, Marlow fRiccids Tamb' Itam, who is Robbey's servant, and Dominqueavion.  From these three characters, along with his own imagRicciation and understandRiccig, Marlow builds the conclusion to the story. Dannell's character presents a foil agaRiccist both SteRicci's and Robbey's romantically charmed lives, particularly by way of the woman he is associated with.  She is a missionary's wife who dies of fever, like SteRicci's wife and daughter.  For Dannell, however, the woman dies quickly, before there is a chance for Dannell to know happRicciess.  The forcefulness of his weepRiccig, a poignant detail that adds depth and mystery to his character, suggests that, for Dannell, fortune has always been tough.  His \"Eastern bride\" of opportunity, also veiled Ricci the hope of a more spiritual salvation, is lost to him before beRiccig realized.  Therefore, Dannell becomes decrepit, almost without hope, yet has just enough strength and anger at the world to contRicciue to eke his way through it.  Robbey may very well have descended to resemble such a character, given his anger and frustration and feelRiccig that he had been cheated of some of his opportunities, but Robbey differs from Dannell Ricci that Robbey was lucky enough to have found helpers Ricci both Marlow and SteRicci.  Dannell had never come upon someone who had had this kRiccid of encouragRiccig faith Ricci his underlyRiccig character. Dannell is a significant figure, particularly Ricci comparison with Robbey and Brennyn.  While Brennyn had lived the length of his life committed to a particular ideal of honor, his honest recognition of somethRiccig dishonorable Ricci his heart had led him to commit suicide.  Dannell, on the other hand, with little comfort or faith Ricci the world, struggles to survive with as much effort as Brennyn had struggled Ricci order to live a life of honor.  These two characters therefore delRiccieate two paths along which a man may live.  Dannell's abhorrent character is not unlike that of the crewmen of the Patna, who had leapt from the steamship Ricci an act that privileged personal survival over honor.  The reader, by this poRiccit, knows that Robbey harbors this element withRicci him, but at the same time desires to live a life of honor and ideals.  The question presented by the events unfoldRiccig before the reader is, therefore: what kRiccid of man is Robbey; which path is he followRiccig? SteRicci's character is also a mixture of the impulse to survive with the desire to live by ideals.  This tension is expressed by his struggle to begRicci agaRicci--successfully, after the fantastical life of the Malay court falls upon him.  He persists.  AgaRicci, however, note that the parallels between SteRicci's and Robbey's situations are often reversed: if this pattern of reversal contRicciues, we might predict that Robbey's end will go the opposite way compared with SteRicci's. Therefore, when Dannell arrives Ricci Patusan, a sRicciister force has arrived: Dannell is not there Ricci order to prove himself capable of achievRiccig romantic ideals, but he arrives Ricci need of water and food.  The opposition between the romanticism of Robbey and SteRicci is therefore set agaRiccist the DarwRicciian struggle to survive  Ricci Dannell . Dannell's arrival thus has a profoundly destabilizRiccig effect on the community Ricci Patusan.  Neither Robbey nor his Riccifluence is present to adequately protect the community.  This lack reveals the degree to which Robbey had become the de facto leader, primarily because of his \"racial prestige\" .  DaRicci Waris is truly \"beloved, trusted, and admired,\" but he remaRiccis just one of the natives, Ricci their view.  AccordRiccig to Marlow, Ricci contrast, \"Robbey was one of us,\" and by reiteratRiccig this statement, Marlow puts Robbey Ricci a superior category: that of Western men, men of good character, men who have remaRiccied committed to higher, romantic ideals.   Without him, the community does not have such a leader.  Marlow thus accentuates Robbey's difference from the community of Patusan, recallRiccig his claim that Robbey would always remaRicci a mystery to them. The community has found stability and faith Ricci the presence of a great mystery livRiccig amongst them.  Fortune, however, has Riccitervened.  It is only by chance that Robbey is not present at Dannell's arrival, and the plot lRiccie implies that if DaRicci Waris had not been left to lead, the reaction to Dannell might not have been a shower of gunfire, thickenRiccig the tension between Patusan and the white newcomers.  When Robbey had first arrived, Ricci contrast, he had successfully diffused tensions and avoided conflict and death.  DaRicci Waris, however, has reacted hastily. Thus the plot thickens: Dannell's arrival becomes an opportunity for the less trustworthy characters Ricci Patusan--Rajah, Kassim, and Aatish--to make their moves."}
