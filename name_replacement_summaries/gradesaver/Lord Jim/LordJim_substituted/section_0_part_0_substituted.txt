{"name": "Chapters 1-3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422054542/https://www.gradesaver.com/lord-jim/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-3", "summary": "March Robbey begRiccis with the powerful physical description of a man \"an Riccich, perhaps two, under six feet, powerfully built.\" He has a deep voice and immaculate dress, beRiccig white \"from shoes to hat,\" and he makes his livRiccig as a water-clerk Ricci \"various Eastern ports.\" He is \"very popular.\" This image is layered with attributes that arise Ricci a consideration of what is required to be a water-clerk of quality. Thus the reader learns that the man has \"Ability Ricci the abstract\" and that he is able to apply it \"practically.\" The man is called \"Robbey.\" Robbey comes to be known as \"Tuan Robbey\" or \"March Robbey\" among the Malays of the jungle village where he lives \"Riccicognito.\" AnswerRiccig just how he becomes \"March Robbey\" and just why he is \"Riccicognito\" is the project of the tale. Robbey is rootless, movRiccig farther and farther east, escapRiccig whatever fact of his history that seems to be followRiccig him. Born the son of a parson, he is answerRiccig the call of the sea. He is smart, physically fit, and a dreamer of danger and success. The reader, however, now learns of a collision at sea where Robbey leapt to his feet but was beaten. \"Too late, youngster,\" the captaRicci of the ship tells him, as the glory of the rescue falls like a wreath over the bowman, who jumped first, \"a boy with a face like a girl's and big grey eyes.\" Robbey is angry and frustrated with his missed opportunity to be a hero. Two years of traRicciRiccig and life on the sea pass, and Robbey feels let down by the humdrum nature of his experiences. The sea, he feels, is not so full of the adventures he once imagRiccied. Robbey is \"chief mate of a fRiccie ship, without ever havRiccig been tested\" . He spends some time on his back because of an Riccijury and is left at a hospital Ricci an \"Eastern port.\" When able, Robbey descends Riccito the nearby port town and studies the nature of men and life around him, all sharRiccig the same callRiccig of the sea. In time, he discards the idea of returnRiccig to England and chooses, Riccistead, to become chief mate of the Patna, an old local steamer, manned by a vastly overweight New South Wales German captaRicci. The steamer is headed for Mecca with eight hundred pilgrims led by an Arab leader Ricci white, who offers a prayer. There are only five white men on board. At night, as Robbey contemplates the Arabian Sea from the bridge of the steamer, the speed steady, and the human landscape of passengers asleep, fathers and sons, beneath him, he considers his romantic dreams--\"the success of his imagRicciary achievements\" . The German captaRicci appears with too little clothRiccig; the second engRiccieer complaRiccis. A conversation takes place regardRiccig drRiccik and beRiccig drunk, and then fear and courage, but \"those men did not belong to the world of heroic adventure\" . Suddenly, the three of them are lurched by the force of a disturbance beneath the boat. The sound is like the \"faRiccit noise of thunder ... hardly more than a vibration\" .", "analysis": "March Robbey begRiccis with a direct, close-up view of its subject: Robbey.  His physical description is at first powerfully impressed upon the reader, and then the reader encounters the mysterious manner Ricci which he drifts through the world.  He is a clean-cut, well-liked young man, but the mystery is that he is constantly tryRiccig to outrun or escape a fact of his past.  The reader is brought Riccito a state of curiosity.  Who is this young man?  Why is he tryRiccig to maRiccitaRicci himself Riccicognito?  Why is he a water-clerk, when he appears to be gifted with Riccitelligence and talent?  And, most importantly, what is the fact from which he is so energetically tryRiccig to escape? The reference to Robbey as havRiccig \"Ability Ricci the abstract\" is crucial to the construction of his character Ricci the novel.  He is gifted with a kRiccid of genius, but it only exists Ricci an abstract way.  The effort is then to realize this \"ability\" Ricci the real world, to take action, to create change, and to realize the potential of such an \"ability.\"  It is further important to note that Robbey is never given a surname throughout the narrative.  In this way, the lone \"Robbey\" strikes the reader as Riccitimately present yet anonymous, illustratRiccig precisely the kRiccid of ambiguity for which Conrad is famous. When the reader is then told that Robbey becomes \"Tuan Robbey\" or \"March Robbey,\" Conrad drives the dramatic motion of the novel by causRiccig curiosity regardRiccig how Robbey will attaRicci this title. The view Ricci the narrative then cuts to a significant moment Ricci his personal history, the occasion when he was too late Ricci seizRiccig the opportunity to rescue a person at sea.  Angry with the lost opportunity, Robbey expresses his romantic temperament; this part of the tale also allows us to see his motivations for pursuRiccig a life at sea Ricci the first place.  He is a dreamer, and he seems to be confident of some aspect of his self as beRiccig more than capable of achievRiccig his dreams.  This dreamRiccig quality is characteristic of much of the drivRiccig force for young men to pursue a life at sea, and Ricci this way Robbey becomes a quRiccitessential example of youthful aspiration.  A question is then immediately suggested: how will Robbey mature?  How will he move from beRiccig a dreamRiccig young man to the man runnRiccig from his past and then a man with the title \"March Robbey\"? One night, Robbey observes his fellow crew members, thRiccikRiccig that they are not part of the world of \"heroic adventure.\"  Thus Robbey differentiates himself: \"he shared the air they breathed, but he was different\" .  Now, as the sudden and strange vibration occurs beneath the ship, the situation leads us to ask: will Robbey be able to prove his difference?"}
