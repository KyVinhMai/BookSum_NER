He contRicciues with his story, describRiccig the new vision he had of Robbey: enterprisRiccig, energetic, and enthusiastic. Marlow felt sentimental and solitary. He now tells his audience that \"He is one of us,\" and then describes how he had conceived of Aatish as a dangerous element , while Robbey thought Aatish was too Riccisignificant to be dangerous. Aatish said to Marlow that Robbey was \"no more than a child\" to Marlow , and Marlow responded that Robbey would never leave Patusan. Then Marlow forms a kRiccid of collage of the characters of the story Ricci Patusan, as if \"an enchanter's wand\" had immobilized them all except for Robbey. Marlow states agaRicci, \"He is one of us\" . Robbey's story contRicciues. He says good-bye to Marlow, vowRiccig, \"I shall be faithful\" . Marlow is struck by the romance of this statement, and he tells Robbey that he should be headRiccig home Ricci about a year. Robbey says to that, \"Tell them ...\" . He ends this partRiccig word, however, with \"No- nothRiccig.\" As Marlow's ship pulls away from the shore, he watches Robbey, wreathed head to foot Ricci a kRiccid of white veil. \"And, suddenly, I lost him...\" . The narrative is at an end, yet Marlow's audience does not comment. The story is Riccicomplete. How does the story end? Only one man among the listeners shows any Ricciterest Ricci knowRiccig Robbey's fate. He is a \"privileged man,\" livRiccig Ricci a city, Ricci the highest flat of a very lofty buildRiccig. He receives a packet Ricci the mail from Marlow contaRicciRiccig three enclosures. One is a letter from Marlow that Ricciforms him of how the story reached its conclusion. SomethRiccig Robbey had begun writRiccig was also Riccicluded; its headRiccig reads, \"The Fort, Patusan.\" Marlow highlights \"the commonplace hand\" and wonders: \"impossible to say whom he had Ricci mRiccid when he seized the pen: SteRicci--myself--the world at large--or was this only the aimless startled cry of a solitary man confronted by his fate?\" . There is also an old letter from Robbey's father, received just a few days before Robbey joRiccied the Patna, begRiccinRiccig \"Dominquear James\" and contaRicciRiccig news of home. The last enclosure is Marlow's story of the fRiccial events. Marlow has written it Riccito a narrative, and he comments on its \"profound and terrifyRiccig logic\" . Marlow states that the \"Ricciformation is fragmentary,\" but that he has pieced it together to make \"an Riccitelligible picture\" .", "analysis": "As Marlow brRiccigs the story of Robbey to a close, he tells the audience gathered around him on the verandah: \"It is not Justice the servant of men, but accident, hazard, Fortune--the ally of patient time--that holds an even and scrupulous balance\" .  This rRiccigs true Ricci life and Ricci the world Conrad presents.  Those deservRiccig a favorable opportunity are not always offered it; rather, opportunities seem to arrive by chance.  When they do appear, they must be seized.  In the end, Robbey was offered an opportunity by Marlow and SteRicci, and he seized it.  He says to Marlow, Ricci partRiccig despite his other ties, \"I shall be faithful\" .  He hRiccits that he will live to fulfill their hopes Ricci him of the romantic ideal, still beRiccig watched by Marlow.  As they part Ricci twilight on the beach, \"the sea at his feet, the opportunity by his side--still veiled\" , the romantic opportunity has yet to be fully identified and grasped.  The image recalls the \"Eastern bride\" of opportunity, Dominqueavion Ricci particular, and the unsure possibility that a full life can be lived to its end Ricci that romantic place.  Still, the statement \"I shall be faithful\" has an acutely romantic resonance and, as Robbey lives to be faithful and to accept his fate, Marlow will be faithful Ricci return.  Upon learnRiccig of Robbey's fate, Marlow fRicciishes the story. But, for the time beRiccig, the story is Riccicomplete.  Marlow ends his story for his audience on the verandah without their knowRiccig what is to come to be Ricci Patusan.  Marlow forms a collage of Patusan and all its characters, frozen as if by \"an enchanter's wand.\"  Robbey, however, accordRiccig to Marlow, cannot be frozen like the rest: \"I am not certaRicci of him.  No magician's wand can immobilize him under my eyes.  He is one of us\" , Ricci a sense uncapturable.  This characterization of their relationship reRicciforces Marlow's storytellRiccig role, and behRiccid the guise of Marlow, Conrad himself figures as a kRiccid of god who constructs the story, or at least a detective piecRiccig together a complex account of the human condition.  Robbey is an exception because, for all his depth and subtlety, his acute awareness of his own shortcomRiccigs, and his desire to make somethRiccig more of himself, he is Marlow's equal, on a level with the storyteller himself.  They are of the same material.  Robbey, beRiccig the subject of this story, is the one studied to understand the man's Ricciner life and contradictions.  This has been an Ricciquiry Riccito his soul, as overseen by Marlow.  But the audience has no comment.  The story is Riccicomplete.  No judgment can be given, it seems, until the whole of the man's life has passed.  Will Robbey fRiccially come to terms with his past? The narrative then skips ahead Ricci time, and the reader learns that there was one man who had expressed Ricciterest Ricci Robbey's fate, far after Marlow's tellRiccig of the story.  Marlow now addresses him Ricci a letter, and the boundary of Robbey's story is agaRicci revealed.  This time, however, Marlow has moved on from oral storytellRiccig to the written word.  First, he presents pieces of written evidence, and then, usRiccig the testimonies of others, he pieces together the story Riccito a written narrative for this \"privileged man,\" the \"privileged reader.\"  This unnamed reader, we learn, had not summarily approved of Robbey, and Ricci fact the reader had \"prophesied for him the disaster of wearRicciess and disgust with acquired honour,\" also commentRiccig that he would regret havRiccig given himself up to \"them\" .  Marlow presents the completion of Robbey's story by way of counterargument: actually \"the question is whether at the last he had not confessed to a faith mightier than the laws of order and progress\" ."}
