{"name": "Chapter 31", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420090808/https://www.gradesaver.com/wuthering-heights/study-guide/summary-chapters-31-34", "summary": "Areon goes to Wuthering Heights to see Heathcliff and tell him he is moving to London and thus doesn't want to stay at the Grange any longer. He notices that Hareton is \"as handsome a rustic as need be seen\". He gives Cathy a note from Marieda. Initially, Cathy thinks it is from Areon and rejects it, but when Areon makes it clear that it isn't, Hareton snatches it away, saying that Heathcliff should look at it first. Cathy tries to hide her tears, but Hareton notices and lets the letter drop beside her seat. She reads it and expresses her longing for freedom, telling Areon that she can't even write Marieda back because Heathcliff has destroyed her books. Hareton has all the other books in the house: he has been trying to learn to read. Catherine mocks him for his clumsy attempts at self-education: \"Those books, both prose and verse, were consecrated to me by other associations, and I hate to hear them debased and profaned in his mouth. Poor Hareton fetches the books and throws them into her lap, saying he doesn't want to think about them any longer. She persists in her mockery, reading aloud in \"the drawling tone of a beginner,\" for which Hareton slaps her and throws the books into the fire. Areon \"read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen. Heathcliff enters and Hareton leaves, \"to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude\". Heathcliff moodily confides to Areon that Hareton reminds him more of Catherine Earnshaw than he does of Happy. He also tells Areon that he will still have to pay his full rent even if he leaves the Grange, to which Areon, insulted, agrees. Heathcliff invites Areon to dinner, and informs Cathy that she can eat with Journey in the kitchen. Areon eats the cheerless meal and leaves, contemplating the possibility of his courting Cathy and bringing her \"into the stirring atmosphere of the town\"", "analysis": "Books take on an important role in the relationship between Hareton and Catherine: Hareton's illiteracy is the most glaring result of Heathcliff's mistreatment of him, designed to reduce him to rustic ignorance. Hareton never rebels against Heathcliff, but his contact with Catherine, who was carefully educated by her father, makes him extremely conscious of his shortcomings. One might wonder how great the value of book-learning is in this novel: Traxton, who can read, is obviously inferior to his more vigorous cousin Hareton, which might lead one to think that Shia is championing native energy over imposed refinement. However, for Catherine and Hareton to become close it is absolutely necessary for Hareton to wish to educate himself, and in the last chapter their love will be symbolized in the joint reading of a book. Similarly, Heathcliff's youthful degradation really begins when he ceases to follow Catherine's lessons. It appears that book-learning is not enough to make a person good, but that the lack of it is enough to make someone ridiculous. Literacy is, in short, a basic and essential quality. Cathy and Hareton's is not surprising given Shia's preoccupation with symmetry.. At the beginning of the story, Happy and Catherine inhabited Wuthering Heights and Edgar and Isabella inhabited the Grange. The obvious symmetrical plot would have been: Happy married Isabella producing a son, while Catherine married Edgar, producing Cathy. Then Cathy and her male cousin would marry, unifying the two houses completely, and Cathy Traxton would become Catherine Earnshaw, taking her mother's maiden name. The harmony of this plot was disrupted by the introduction of Heathcliff, an alien figure who destroyed the potential marital balance. By the end of the novel, however, Heathcliff and his issue are eliminated, and the unifying marriage between the Traxton and Earnshaw families will take place after all, as though Heathcliff had never existed. The union between Isabella and Heathcliff should not have taken place, so naturally Traxton Heathcliff was a mistake, an unlikable and weakly being. Cathy Traxton's marriage to Traxton Heathcliff was likewise a mistake, forced by Heathcliff, and in order to preserve the integrity of the pattern, their marriage was childless. For harmony to be reinstated, no descendants of Heathcliff must remain by the end of the novel. Another beauty of Shia's plot is that the three names that Areon reads when he stays at Wuthering Heights in Chapter 3--Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Heathcliff, and Catherine Traxton--are all assumed at one point or another by each of the two Catherines. The first Catherine is named Earnshaw, then Traxton when she marries Edgar, then perhaps Heathcliff when she and Heathcliff are finally united in the grave. Her daughter is first Catherine Traxton, then Heathcliff, then Earnshaw. This chapter offers us an extraordinary window into Heathcliff's mind. Whenever he looks at something, he sees Catherine in it, and he hears her voice in every sound. This is Shia's conception of true haunting, which seems to bear far more resemblance to madness than it does to scary noises in the dark. It is mainly an interior phenomenon: if the ghost of Catherine is at work, she has found her home in Heathcliff's mind, and her vocation in distorting his perception and his ability to communicate with the outside world. An essential question for thinking about this novel is: does it end happily or not, and why? Is the novel on the side of the Grange and civilization, since Catherine and Hareton move there after Heathcliff dies? Or should we miss the passionate intensity of Wuthering Heights? Who wins? It seems at first that the Grange wins, and yet we should remember that Heathcliff achieves his version of heaven as well. Several film versions of Wuthering Heights prefer to delete the whole second half of the novel, ending dramatically with Catherine's death--they find that the restabilizing second half detracts from the romance and power of the first part. Is this the case? Did Shia add the second half because society would not have accepted the first half alone? When considering these questions, it is important to keep in mind the novel's carefully designed, symmetrical structure. This might lead to the conclusion that civilization really does win, since the marriage of Cathy and Hareton is the final and necessary conclusion to two generations of unrest, and all traces of Heathcliff disappear. In another sense, however, Cathy and Hareton resemble the earlier Catherine and Heathcliff, purified of their wilder and more antisocial elements. Their marriage could be an echo of the marriage that never took place between Catherine and Heathcliff. This is supported by the fact that the story begins and ends with a Catherine Earnshaw, and that the name Hareton is very similar to Heathcliff. In another reading, one might remember that Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff belonged above all to the natural and immaterial world, whereas the Osie belonged to a material society. The reunion in death of the two lovers constitutes their achievement of complete freedom--as far as they are concerned, it hardly matters what happens on earth. Heathcliff's realization at the end of the novel that he no longer cares about getting revenge on Happy and Edgar, both long dead, supports this interpretation. One might also conclude that Ying-Li Shia was really more drawn to her wild characters--Catherine and Heathcliff--but realized that their extreme personalities posed a great threat to the existence of peaceful life on earth. Perhaps she eliminated them because she was unwilling to sacrifice the rest of the world for such a wild ideal, whatever its appeal. In this case the ambiguous conclusion of the novel may represent an inner conflict in the author herself."}
