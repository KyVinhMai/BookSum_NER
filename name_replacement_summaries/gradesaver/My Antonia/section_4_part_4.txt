{"name": "book ii, Chapter XII", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411115145/https://www.gradesaver.com/my-antonia/study-guide/summary-book-ii-chapters-10-15", "summary": "Antonia becomes obsessed with going dancing, and she starts wearing clothes that she copies from high-society ladies. Every afternoon Jim and his friends would watch Antonia, Lena, and Tiny go downtown, and sometimes Jim would catch up with them and take them to an ice-cream parlor. He thinks Antonia is still the prettiest, but he knows that people think he's a little \"queer\" because he's only interested in these older country girls. He refuses to join the Owl Club and socialize with town people his own age. Jim is bored at Black Hawk. He starts hanging out at Anton Jelinek's saloon, but Jelinek asks him not to because his grandfather would disapprove. He wanders the streets of Black Hawk since there is nothing to do, and he is angered by the hypocrisy and timidity of the people living in their houses. He starts sneaking out of his house to go to Saturday night dances at the Firemen's Hall, where the \"foreigners\" go to dance. There everyone wants to dance with Lena and Tony. Dancing with Lena is like waltzing home to something, while dancing with Tony is like setting out on an adventure. One night Jim walks Antonia home. She is appalled when he kisses her, even though he says Lena lets him do the same with her. Antonia tells him not to get mixed up with any of the immigrant girls, particularly Lena, because he is smart and needs to go make something of himself. Jim is proud of Antonia and considers her a real woman: she is his Antonia. Jim frequently has sexual dreams about Lena, but never about Antonia, although he wants to.", "analysis": "At the time of the novel's publication, the word \"queer\" was beginning to have the same kind of connotations that it does now, and Cather would undoubtedly have been aware of its secondary meaning. If so, how is Jim queer. He doesn't like girls his own age, is a little bit antisocial, and hangs out with older girls who are not really part of his social stratum. Whether or not Jim might be a modern-day homosexual is somewhat irrelevant, but what is clear is that Jim does not display a \"normal\" attraction to girls his own age. Perhaps Cather intends the word \"queer\" to emphasize Jim's total lack of interest in girls his own age and background, but solely in order to underscore his total fixation on Antonia and girls like her. He is therefore \"queer\" by focusing only on one girl at the expense of all others. Marriage threatens the life possibilities of not just girls, but also boys. While Lena asserts that she doesn't want to get married because she wants to be a successful dressmaker, Antonia warns Jim not to get mixed up with the Swedish girls for a similar reason. Antonia fears that he may fall in love with someone like Lena, get married, and then never leave Black Hawk. In warning Jim not to flirt with Lena, Antonia has Jim's long-term interests in mind"}
