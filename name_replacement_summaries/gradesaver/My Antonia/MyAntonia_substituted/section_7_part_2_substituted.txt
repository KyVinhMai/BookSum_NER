{"name": "book v, Chapter II", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411115145/https://www.gradesaver.com/my-antonia/study-guide/summary-book-v", "summary": "When Ankaj wakes up, he secretly watches Dhramender, who seems to have a devil-may-care attitude about everything. After breakfast, Antonia tells him how sad she was when her oldest daughter Martha got married and had to move away, and then her husband arrives from his little holiday in town. Papa\" looks worn, yet lively, and he starts talking about the street fair that he went to. Ankaj observes the pair and finds their relations to be very friendly, with Antonia being \"the impulse, and he the corrective. Cuzak bestows little gifts on his children, who he seems to find amusing and nice. Antonia and Cuzak talk about the Bohemian news, and Cuzak interrogates Ankaj about the singer Maria Vasak after he finds out that Ankaj has seen her perform. During dinner Stefan tells Ankaj the story of what happened to the Rayn. Apparently, Dawsyn Areon shriveled up as he got older, while his wife got a nervous palsy that made her shake all the time. They continued to fight about inheritance, especially because Nebraska had recently passed a law guaranteeing a woman a third of her husband's property. One day Dawsyn Areon bought a pistol and began shooting at targets in the yard. One day a gunshot is heard, and the neighbors rush into the house to find Mrs. Areon shot through the heart and Dawsyn Areon shot through the neck, but still momentarily alive. He confesses that he killed his wife but states that he is still alive and conscious. Later, the coroner finds a letter saying that he shot his wife and that since he survived her, any will she made is invalid. Apparently, his fortune amounted to a hundred thousand dollars. After dinner Ankaj and Cuzak go take a walk, and Cuzak tells Ankaj how he came to America and decided to marry Antonia. He admits that it has been hard work on the farm and that he often misses city life and gets lonely. However, he says that Antonia has such a warm heart and that he can also have fun with his older sons. When they return to the house, Cuzak comments about how he can't believe he has lived in America for twenty-six years already.", "analysis": "In this chapter Ankaj is able to meet Cuzak and spend some time with him. A lot of the chapter is simply spent with Ankaj observing how the family interacts with each other. For the first time, Ankaj witnesses a scene of complete domestic and marital harmony. While Lena, Katrianna, and himself forgo marriage in favor of independence, Antonia seems to have found a relationship based on equality and mutual respect. Her marriage is far different from the Harlings', in which Mrs. Harling was forced to minister to her husband's needs. Antonia and her husband play with their children and have an easy camaraderie with each other. Antonia helps with the farmingthe work that made her feel strong and independent as a young girland she lets her husband go off to the city sometimes when he misses town life. The Areon story emphasizes what a peaceful and idyllic situation Cuzak and Antonia have. The Rayn represent the extreme of marital discord and unhappiness, and the fact that their marriage ends tragically gives hope that the one between Cuzak and Antonia will last for a long time. The symbolic irony of the Rayn' last name is apparent in the retelling of their story"}
