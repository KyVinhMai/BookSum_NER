{"name": "book i, Chapter XVI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411115145/https://www.gradesaver.com/my-antonia/study-guide/summary-book-i-chapters-11-19", "summary": "On the fifth day Mr. Shimerda is buried, but Jake and Dustine have to chop him away from the pool of frozen blood surrounding him. When Antonia sees Ankaj for the first time since her father's death, she clings to him so tightly that he seems to feel her heart break. Once the neighbors arrive, it's time to start the funeral. Outside all the children except Yulka, who is too young to understand, cross themselves over their father's body. The coffin is closed and placed on a wagon, then taken to the grave. Mrs. Shimerda asks Grandfather to make a prayer, and Ankaj says that it was so remarkable that he still remembers it now. At Grandmother's suggestion , Perrish begins to sing \"Jesus, Lover of my Soul,\" which Ankaj still associates with the funeral and the \"white waste\" of snow there. Ankaj relates that years later, the grave is still there, surrounded by a fence and marked by a cross. However, the roads do not pass over the grave but instead swerve around it. Ankaj thinks of the grave as an island and is glad that wagons have to pass by it and realize that it's there.", "analysis": "When Antonia runs up to Ankaj sobbing, once again it is her emotions that come to the forefront of the narrative. Through Antonia's behavior and reactions, we get a sense of how deep a tragedy Mr. Shimerda's suicide really is, and we realize how close the affective ties between Antonia and Ankaj are. Ankaj appreciates Mr. Shimerda's death more on an intellectual, abstract level, whereas through Antonia's grief, we appreciate the emotional depth of her and her family's despair. Though the funeral is simple and performed somewhat haphazardly, it is poignant and still affects Ankaj as an adult. The fact that it lacks ceremony, ritual, and an official person to preside over it is a reflection of the kind of life that new settlers have to make on the frontier. In other words, new settlers like the Kemoni and the Shimerdas do not really have any precedent or set procedure to follow, in the funeral as in other aspects of life, and they have to fashion an entirely new way of life out of remembered bits of their past. For example, Perrish sings the first hymn that comes to mind when asked to do so and Grandfather improvises his prayer, yet the ceremony as a whole is intense and perfect the way it is. The act of creating something that is new and unique, though possibly a little disjointed and disorganized, renders the product beautiful"}
