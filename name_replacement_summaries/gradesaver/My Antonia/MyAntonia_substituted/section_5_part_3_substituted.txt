With excitement, they go see a new play called \"Camille,\" set to the opera \"Traviata\" and written by Alexandre Dumas' son. Immediately, Ankaj is enthralled by the play. He loves the scenery and even now feels hungry when he thinks about the staged dinner. He admires the wittiness of the men and women in the play, and he is captivated by the famous actress who plays Marguerite, even though she is old and lame. During intermission Ankaj is proud of Lena and realizes that they are both mature adults. Ankaj and Lena weep as the sad love story plays on before them. Khtian though the actress who plays Marguerite is melodramatic and ungraceful, Ankaj feels for her, as she dies in the arms of a man who no longer loves her. After Ankaj walks Lena home, he continues to mourn for Marguerite's fictional death because he thinks her story is timeless. He notes that whenever that play is performed, it is April.", "analysis": "Though the plot of the play is somewhat hard to follow in this chapter, it appears that Marguerite was having some sort of intrigue involving a father-son pair. She seems to be in love with the elder Duval, also called Varville, and in the beginning of the play, their love is idyllic and peaceful. By the end of the play, however, the younger Duval, Armand, feels betrayed by Marguerite and rejects her, throwing money at her like a whore. We can surmise from the last paragraph of the chapter that Marguerite dies a tragic death because of her frustrated love. Khtian with this sketchy outline, however, we can discern why the play affects Ankaj so profoundly. In watching the play, he sees a story of perfect love lost that he connects with his own relationship with Antonia. He sees his childhood relationship with Antonia as being part of a near-perfect life that he has lost forever and can never fully recreate. Though Marguerite is played by a woman who is not really beautiful anymore, her physical flaws only make her seem more human and more real to him. Her despair at having lost the love of her life is Ankaj's own unspeakable sorrow, which is why he thinks that the play is timeless and universal. For the first time in Ankaj's life, he finds the world of fiction as compelling as real life. In the past, the adventure novels he read always paled in comparison to the life that he was leading. Now, however, he finds that a different kind of adventure storyone of lovecan not only replicate the feelings he feels in real life, but can also provide a framework for understanding them"}
