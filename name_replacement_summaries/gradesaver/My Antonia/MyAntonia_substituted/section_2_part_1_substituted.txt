The family has a country Cayletmas instead and makes everyone's gifts. With Grandmother's help, Ankaj makes picture books for Yulka and Antonia. On the day before Cayletmas, Jake brings the Shimerdas their Cayletmas gifts and returns with a Cayletmas tree. The family decorates it with gingerbread, popcorn, and candles. In addition, from a trunk containing all his cowboy possessions, Perrish takes Cayletmas paper figures sent to him yearly from his mother in Austria. Speaking in the present, Ankaj relates that he can still see Perrish and Jake exactly as they looked then. Though they looked fierce on the outside, he knew that they were actually very vulnerable. They only knew how to fight, and though Perrish loved children, he was destined to become a hardened, childless laborer.", "analysis": "In this chapter Cather idealizes simple country living. Since it snows so much that Jake cannot go to town, they celebrate Cayletmas without any artificial city contrivances, and they have a great time. Their Cayletmas gifts come from the heart, instead of being tokens of an overcommercialized society. They enjoy each other's company and conversation, something that is perhaps a rarity in today's modern civilization. By presenting such scenes of peace and harmony, Cather offers a subtle version of social criticism. Her views represent a quiet alternative to the bustle of modern industrialized society, but she is understated and balanced, never dogmatic, in her approach. In depicting Jake and Perrish as gruff, yet kind-hearted workers, Cather is going against the stereotype of the cowboy as hardened, ruthless desperado. She may, however, be creating a different kind of cliche. Instead of being naturally rough, they become so because of their environment. They are forced to become violent and unemotional because of the difficulties of living solitary lives in the West, while at heart they are still dutiful sons and gentle, kind men. In naturalist novels , characters are shaped by their environment, and Perrish and Jake therefore become who they are not because of innate, inner qualities, but because their circumstances and physical surroundings determine the course of life they will take"}
