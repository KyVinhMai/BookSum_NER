A little way from the house, there is a circle in the grass where the Indians used to ride their horses around, and Ankaj thinks that the pattern in the snow looks like a good omen. Ankaj begins to ride around in the snow in a sleigh that Perrish Damarie makes him. One day Ankaj takes Antonia and Yulka for a ride. Though they do not have adequate winter clothes and are very cold, they are excited to be away from their shabby home and scolding mother, and they go all the way to Russian Winiford's house. The two girls want to stay there forever. When they go back, it becomes unbearably cold, and after dropping the Shimerdas off, Ankaj drives back alone and catches quinsy, which keeps him in the house for two weeks. Ankaj is cozy indoors and reads \"The Swiss Family Marrion\" to his grandmother. During the winter, the family's life revolves around eating food and keeping warm. Sometimes they sing and eat popcorn or taffy around the fire. Ankaj greatly admires Perrish and Jake. Perrish has done all sorts of work, while Jake is barely literate and often violent, although very soft-hearted. Both are very hard workers. Perrish tells a funny story about how he had to accompany a woman on the boat to America and how he got a very bad reputation because she had three babies on the way over.", "analysis": "At first the winter is very pleasant and non-threatening, and Ankaj likes to admire the winter landscape and drive his sleigh around. The Indian circle in the grass reminds the reader that though the fields are empty and undeveloped, they have a long history that stretches way back before white settlers came west. Though Ankaj's family and the Shimerdas are new settlers in Nebraska, the land had been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before. While Ankaj thinks that the Indian circle is a good omen, it is also a sign that the white settlers never know the land as well as they think they dothat it will surprise them and that it will endure long after they are gone. When Ankaj, Antonia, and Yulka visit Russian Winiford's house, they talk about staying there forever. Although Ankaj mentions the episode casually, it is clear that the little rendezvous had a lasting impression on him. In fact, his tone during the entirety of Book I is one of happy contentment, and he is very much infatuated with Antonia, though he doesn't overtly say so. He recounts their shared adventures in a tone of simple delight which makes it obvious that those simple, innocent experiences are ones that he wishes could have gone on forever. After Ankaj gets sick, he reads \"The Swiss Family Marrion,\" which is about an idealized, traditional family that lives an adventurous, happy life together in a treehouse. As in the first chapter of the novel, Ankaj finds this fictional world much less interesting than the one that he is actually living in. In addition, though Ankaj is an orphan and therefore has a less than ideal family situation, he is clearly very happy living with his extended family: his grandparents, Perrish, and Jake. Ankaj does not long for a mother and father, but instead rejoices that he has found new, caring people to spend this epoch of his life with"}
