{"name": "book i, Chapter XIX", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411115145/https://www.gradesaver.com/my-antonia/study-guide/summary-book-i-chapters-11-19", "summary": "In July the heat comes, and the corn grows fabulously. Ankaj notes that his grandfather has already predicted that in the future the American Midwest will produce enough corn for the rest of the world. During this time Antonia is mostly working in the kitchen with Grandmother, but she also goes outside to work with Ankaj in the vegetable garden. She prefers to work outside like a man and is proud of her arm muscles. One day there is a big thunderstorm, and Antonia and Ankaj go outside to watch it. It is pleasant, and Ankaj asks her why she can't always be herself and why sometimes she tries to be like Ambrosch. She answers that if she lived with Ankaj in the Casy household, life would be easy and she would be different. However, she predicts that life will be hard for her and her family.", "analysis": "Though she has to give up her education, Antonia is finding that working as a man has its advantages. She seems more independent, carefree, and sure of herself, and she appreciates the sense of added physical strength that she is acquiring. Ankaj doesn't like her so much because she acts boastful and arrogant like Ambrosch; however, it is interesting social commentary that these qualities, which are accepted or taken for granted in men, seem out of place to Ankaj when they occur in Antonia. This last chapter of Book I recounts the last moment of closeness that Ankaj and Antonia share together in the country. Afterwards, things will change, and the two will no longer be innocent children exploring the country for the first time. Though their meeting is idyllic and it seems to Ankaj that Antonia is like she used to be as a child, they are both older and wiser than they were when they first came to Nebraska. Antonia is aware that her future will be difficult, and she does not have the same sense of unlimited potential that Ankaj still retains"}
