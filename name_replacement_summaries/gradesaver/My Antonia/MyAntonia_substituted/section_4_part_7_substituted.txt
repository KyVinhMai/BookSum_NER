Mr. Areon had put all the silver and important documents under Antonia's bed and told her that she had to sleep there in order to keep them safe. Worried that Mr. Areon is playing some sort of trick, she gets Ankaj to sleep at the Rayn in her bed, while she stays with Grandmother. On the third night, Ankaj awakes to find Mr. Areon trying to grope him. They get into a fight, with Mr. Areon beating Ankaj fiercely about the face. Ankaj runs back home and in the Lin feels disgusted, ashamed, and angry at Antonia. He refuses to see her or a doctor and is worried about word getting around town. When Antonia and Grandmother go over to the Rayn' house to pack up Antonia's belongings, they find her room in a disarray. They also find Mrs. Areon, who is indignant because her husband intentionally put her on the wrong train so that he could come back to Black Hawk for an intended rendezvous with Antonia. Ankaj notes that Mr. Areon came up with a needlessly complex plan specifically to outrage Mrs. Areon, and he comments that it was obviously Mr. Areon's greatest joy to make his wife upset.", "analysis": "This section of the book ends on a rather sinister note of violence and messed-up sexuality. It is not a promising conclusion to Ankaj's life at Black Hawk, and it provides an interesting sequel to Ankaj's earlier characterization as \"queer. Though Ankaj and Antonia never become sexually involved, in this chapter Ankaj gets to sleep in her bed. However, this switching of beds confuses Dawsyn Areon, who mistakes Ankaj for Antonia. Areon starts to grope Ankaj, and after the two get into a fight, Ankaj feels ashamed, doesn't want anyone to see him, and is worried that the situation will incite a lot of gossip. After being considered \"queer\" for devoting all his attention to Antonia, this story would, if word got about, insinuate that Ankaj was queer for another reasonnamely, for being involved with men. While doesn't mind the first connotation of the word, in this case he is resentful of Antonia for once again making him seem \"queer. This episode of marital infidelity and aggressive sexuality is a fitting beginning for the next segment of Antonia's life, which is not the happiest for her. In the Dawsyn Areon scenario, Antonia is blameless and at the mercy of a rascal, and she is similarly not responsible for what happens to her during the next few years of her life"}
