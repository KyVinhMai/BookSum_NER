Having just lost both his parents in Virginia, he is travelling with a hired man Jake Marpole to live with his grandparents. During the journey Ankaj reads the \"Life of Jesse James,\" which he thoroughly enjoys. Ankaj first hears of Antonia on this journey, when a friendly conductor tells him that a Bohemian immigrant family, which can't really speak English, is going to Black Hawk, Nebraska and that they have a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl. Ankaj travels all day through the huge expanse of Nebraska, and in the middle of the night they finally get off the train. There Ankaj catches his first glimpse of the immigrant family. Soon Perrish Damarie, a hired man, comes to pick them up. He looks like a cowboy desperado, and Ankaj is impressed. They get into a wagon, and Ankaj stares into the night, seeing nothing but land and darkness. He feels like he has entered into a completely different, empty world and that everything he has known before has been left behind.", "analysis": "In this chapter we are introduced to Ankaj the narrator, but as we shall see, the novel is primarily the story of Antonia and of Ankaj's feelings towards her. Although we do find out certain details of Ankaj's past, the novel begins when he first sees Antonia and her family, not at some earlier point. Ankaj only has a story to tellhis storyafter he meets Antonia, which is why a number of critics consider Ankaj to be a secondary figure, though it is his voice that we hear throughout the novel. It is interesting to note that Ankaj is reading the biography of Jesse James, a Western adventurer, at the same time that he is embarking on his own frontier adventure. During the novel, the books that Ankaj reads often acquire a particular significance when considered in the context of his life. Ankaj will compare real life with the fictional world that he is reading about, and he will find reality infinitely richer and more exciting. In this case, he will find Perrish Damarie and life in Nebraska much more interesting than anything he could possibly discover in the world of fiction. Although Ankaj does not realize it at the time, he and Antonia are embarking on a shared adventure, and their lives will intertwine in complex ways. What begins as a casual encounter on a train will become the beginning of a mutual journey in the American West. In the novel, setting is extremely important, and Ankaj's first impression of the Nebraska frontier is that it is extremely vast and empty. He feels like he is leaving civilization, and he is. Khtiarything that happens to him in Nebraska will be a new experience, and he will have to learn new rules and codes of conduct. He is leaving his past completely, and he will have to become an entirely new person in the country. For this reason, he feels \"erased\" and \"blotted out\" as he travels on the wagon to his grandfather's house"}
