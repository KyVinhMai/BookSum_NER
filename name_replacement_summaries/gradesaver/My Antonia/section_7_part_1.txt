He had sent her pictures of Bohemia when he went to visit, and he had visited Tiny and Lena in San Francisco, who told him that Antonia had remarried a Bohemian man named Anton Cuzak, had a hard life, and had about ten or eleven children. Jim was afraid to see the effects of twenty years on Antonia but finally decides to go see her. While walking up to Antonia's house, he is greeted by a number of her children in succession, and right before meeting her, he feels terrified and nervous about seeing her. He recognizes her immediately, but she takes awhile to figure out who it is. When she does, however, she is very excited. She then introduces all her children to Jim. Her favorite is twelve-year-old, mischievous Leo, who was born on Easter. Jim finds that though Antonia has lost some of her teeth, she is still full of life and energy. Antonia and all the children show Jim their cave full of all kinds of fruit and their orchard, full of trees that Antonia and her husband Anton watered individually. Everything is peaceful, alive, vibrant, and harmonious. Antonia tells Jim that she worked hard all her life to help her husband, who had no experience farming. She is happy in the country and never gets depressed the way she did in the city. She is glad she lived in the town because there she learned how to cook, keep house, and raise children. Jim takes a walk with the two older boys, Ambrosch and Anton. He is impressed with how well-made and upright they are, and he tells them to always respect their mother because he used to be in love with her and knows how special she is. They tell him that their mother talks about him a lot. Afterwards, there is a lively and pleasant supper, followed by musical performances by the children. Then they all look at old photographs, and Jim realizes that Antonia's relationship with her children is very much like her relationship with him and the Harling children years ago. Antonia provides stories and entertainment. Jim goes to sleep in the haymow with two of the boys. As he lies awake, he sees a succession of images of Antonia and realizes that \"she lent herself to immemorial human attitudes which we recognize by instinct as universal and true. She \"reveals the meaning in common things,\" and Jim thinks of her as \"a rich mine of life, like the founders of early races.", "analysis": "In this chapter Jim sees Antonia in her ultimate incarnation as an earth mother, the bringer of new life. Everywhere life surrounds her: in her innumerable children, in the plethora of fruits and trees surrounding the house, in the myriad of farm animals running around, and in the playful interactions of her and her children. Expecting to see a tired, worn-out woman, Jim is surprised at how energetic and full of life Antonia is among her brood of children. Instead of draining her energies, her children seem to feed it, and their enthusiasm is contagious as Jim discovers firsthand. Jim admires all of Antonia's children, and the strong, manly boys in particular. Antonia is not raising a gaggle of uncontrollable children; instead, Jim sees her as the mother of a new race of people who love the land, each other, and life itself. As Jim realizes as he falls asleep, Antonia captures universal human attitudes in herself and brings them out in other people: she is Woman, and though she may not be the most financially successful person, she is the richest in life and love. After pitying Antonia for so long for not making more of herself, he realizes that she has achieved her ultimate destiny and is repaying the land, which nurtured her in her youth, with new life, her own innumerable offspring. Jim realizes that Antonia has achieved a success much more lasting than Tiny's or Lena's. Though Jim is not physically present during twenty years of Antonia s life, he is very much present in her imagination and those of her children. It is obvious that Antonia talks about him a lot to her children and that she cherishes his memory. Similarly, Jim holds Antonia's memory dear, which is paradoxically why he puts off seeing her for so long. Jim and Antonia have an emotional attachment that stretches across time and distance and which guarantees that their story will never really end. They continue to exert an influence on each other, though their actual physical interaction is actually quite limited. For this reason, the story of Jim's life is also the story of Antonia's"}
