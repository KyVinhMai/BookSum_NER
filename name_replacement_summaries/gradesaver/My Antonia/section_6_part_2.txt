{"name": "book iv, Chapter II", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411115145/https://www.gradesaver.com/my-antonia/study-guide/summary-book-iv", "summary": "Jim takes his grandparents to have their picture taken, and while at the photographer, sees an elaborately framed portrait of Antonia's baby. He decides that he must see her and is happy that Antonia is not too ashamed to hide her baby from public view. Larry Donovan is a passenger conductor for the railroad and acts like a superior, underappreciated individual. He spends a lot of time getting women to sympathize with his sad plight, and he convinces them that he is much better than he really is. Jim goes to Mrs. Harling and tells her he wants to know about Antonia's aborted marriage. She tells him to go ask the Widow Steavens, who knows the entire story and loves to talk.", "analysis": "Though Jim is disappointed in Antonia's current mode of life, he does not feel disdain or contempt for her. Rather, he still feels a great deal of affection for her and is pleased that she feels no shame about having a child out of wedlock. By displaying her baby's portrait so prominently, she is indicating to Jim that she is still as strong and independent as ever and will do what she wants regardless of what people say, just as she did when she was working in the fields for Ambrosch. It is this quality that perhaps Jim most admires in Antonia, though it is also the quality that sometimes causes him pain and distress"}
