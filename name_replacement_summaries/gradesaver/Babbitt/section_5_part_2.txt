{"name": "Chapter XX", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210802030545/https://www.gradesaver.com/babbitt/study-guide/summary-chapters-xix-xxii", "summary": "At Paul's hotel, Babbitt tells the clerk that he is Paul's brother-in-law in order to be allowed to wait in Paul's room until his return. After three hours, Paul arrives, upset with Babbitt for \"butting into affairs\". When Babbitt chastises him for being an immoral husband, Paul breaks down and explains that he \"can't go Zilla's hammering any longer\" and that he is too tired of her torture to be moral. With May Arnold, things are pleasant and simple. Babbitt apologizes and agrees to help Paul by telling Zilla that they ran into each other in Akron, where Paul is supposed to be. After sending her a postcard from Akron on the way home, Babbitt drops in on Zilla back in Zenith to casually remark that he ran into Paul in Akron. Zilla confides that she is extremely worried that Paul is having an affair, and Babbitt denies it, convincing her that she should be nicer to Paul or she will eventually drive him into the arms of another woman after all. When Paul returns, Zilla is much kinder, but Paul tells Babbitt that \"it's too late now\"; he is determined to \"break away from her\" someday", "analysis": "In a passing, casual way, Lewis's allusion to the unethical deal that Babbitt makes with the Zenith Street Traction Company emphasizes the moral depravity indicated by the previous chapters on inadequate religion. Eathorne makes an off-the-books loan to Babbitt to complete the \"triple-crossing\"  deal. In the past, Babbitt has been professionally dishonest, but he has always been able to convince himself that his actions were just. In this case, Babbitt acts in a way that he knows to be dishonest. He has fallen so far from his image of the Solid Citizen  that he no longer upholds his former values and standards. Lewis's explanation that \"In the midst of closing this splendid deal ... Babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person working for him\"  drives the nail into the coffin of this moral condemnation in that it reveals Babbitt's shameless hypocrisy. The focus of this section now shifts back to the relationship between Babbitt and Paul, who has an affair and is convicted of killing his wife on the grounds of temporary insanity. When Babbitt sees Paul at the table with May Arnold, his reaction is strongly negative. He has \"so strong an impulse to go to Paul that he  feel his body uncoiling, his shoulders moving, but he  desperately that he must be diplomatic\" . He finds May Arnold \"doubtful\" and \" withered\"  and a \"dried-up hag\" . These feelings betray his jealousy. George is so persistent that he waits in Paul's hotel room for three hours in the middle of the night, reminding himself that he must be careful not to say \"foolish dramatic things to Paul\" . After a brief argument about morality upon Paul's return, Babbitt stands beside Paul, \"patting his shoulder, making soft apologetic noises\" . Later, in the cab on the way home, \"Babbitt incredulously  tears crowding into his eyes\" . Reviewed together, all of these reactions indicate a possessiveness, intimacy, and depth of emotion that exceed the boundaries of a typical male friendship. Babbitt is more shaken by Paul's affair with May than he has been about anything else thus far. He does not even understand his emotions, since he realizes that the situation does not call for such anxiety and distress. The suggestion of a homoerotic attraction seems stronger now. This suggestion is strengthened by Babbitt's reaction to the news that Paul has been thrown in jail. In an act of selflessness of which he seems almost incapable, he offers to commit perjury in order to save his friend. He will not tolerate it if his friends or family discuss the event. When Paul is finally thrown in prison, Babbitt must confront \"a world which, without Paul,  meaningless\" . It becomes clear now how much of Babbitt's life has really centered around Paul in a way that seems to surpass Babbitt's relationship even with his wife.  Although extremely close male friendships do not have to be homoerotic, this one, on Babbitt's part, might be."}
