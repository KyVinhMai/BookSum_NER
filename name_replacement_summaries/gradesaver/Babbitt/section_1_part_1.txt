{"name": "Chapter IV", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210802030545/https://www.gradesaver.com/babbitt/study-guide/summary-chapters-iv-vi", "summary": "Babbitt writes an advertisement for a cemetery on Linden Lane before returning to the monotony of \"routine details\" , which include constructing an illogical and futile scheme to quit smoking. He calls an old friend, Paul Riesling, and they decide to meet for lunch at the Athletic Club. Babbitt reflects on his own expertise in the real estate business, yet it is clear that he lacks the exhaustive knowledge of the city required of a truly informed salesman. In fact, his actions and beliefs seem to challenge each other in constant hypocrisy. He has a conference with Conrad Lyte and Archibold Purdy in which he convinces Lyte to buy to lot adjacent to Purdy's grocery store for thousands of dollars more than it is worth, and subsequently he convinces Purdy to buy the lot for several times its worth", "analysis": "Babbitt's ineptitude, inner conflict, and constant hypocrisy are perhaps most evident in his alleged attempts to quit smoking. He stops smoking \"at least once a month\"  by coming up with a new elaborate plan involving several steps and a very detailed schedule. He does most of what he sets out to do--except stop smoking. He consistently forgets that he has resolved to quit. He even buys himself an electric cigar lighter. This is more than mere hypocrisy. Lewis's biting sarcasm here indicates that Babbitt's behavior is a reflection upon his lack of inner resolve and his inability to determine what he wants and believes. Appropriately, his professional life is also devoid of integrity and meaning . Although he considers himself an honest and competent salesman, Lewis makes it clear through the plot and satire that he is, in fact, regularly unethical in his business dealings and that he does not know nearly \"everything about his own city and its environs,\" despite his claim that this is the \"duty and privilege of the realtor\" . He relies on newspapers and the Church to tell him what to think and believe. His drive toward conformity has completely obliterated his agency as an individual. Babbitt shows how easily persuaded he is during his conversation with Ted about getting his education by correspondence. Despite the fact that these advertisements, included in full, are the victims of brutal satiric ridicule, he is nearly convinced that with minimal effort and money, his son really can learn the art of \"Prosperity and Domination\" and can hold all the secrets of a masterful personality. In addition to the ways in which these ads undermine themselves with ludicrous rags-to-riches stories of expensive automobiles and unparalleled social status, Lewis offers an unexpected blow with the address listed on the posting: \"Shortcut Educational Pub. Co., Desk, WA, Sandpit, Iowa\" . These courses offer nothing more than a shortcut to nowhere, and Mrs. Babbitt is the only one sensible enough to notice  that Ted must go to college in order to attain money and prestige.  Far from the decision is any idea that an education is a good in itself as part of an individual's personal development. The Zenith Athletic Club is subject to a similar brand of satire. Lewis notes that it is \"not athletic and it isn't exactly a club\" . It also has a fireplace without a fire, musicianless musicians, and members who criticize other clubs but join a club the moment they are invited. Despite the focus on Babbitt's complacent conformity and inept hypocrisy, these chapters also hint at the rebellion that is floating through his consciousness. At lunch with Paul, he reveals that, though he feels guilty about it, he is significantly dissatisfied with his wife and family. He explains that he has fulfilled the requirements of the American Dream ), yet he feels that his life is empty. Paul explains that he, too, is dissatisfied and unhappy, and he suspects that plenty of the other upstanding gentlemen whom they know are in the same position. Their conversation is a reflection on how the merely external aspects of the American Dream, once achieved, leave the superficial person  feeling restless, unhappy, and betrayed."}
