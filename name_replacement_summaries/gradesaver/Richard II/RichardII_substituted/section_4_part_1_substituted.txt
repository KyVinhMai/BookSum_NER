{"name": "act 5, Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419164219/https://www.gradesaver.com/richard-ii/study-guide/summary-act-5", "summary": "Richard's Queen meets him as he is being taken into the Tower, and Richard tells her to leave for France immediately. Northumberland arrives and changes the orders, telling Richard he will instead be sent to Pomfret. The Queen says goodbye to Richard after failing to convince Northumberland to let her go with him. She leaves for France, and Richard is taken north", "analysis": "Richard for the first time abandons language in this final act. Throughout the play he has not fought with anyone, preferring instead to defend himself with language. However, in scene five he becomes the aggressor, succeeding in killing two men before being killed himself. This change in Richard, from using language and ceremony to adopting war and violence, comes too late for him. Had he chosen to fight earlier in the play, history might have been different. The death of Richard is a significant liability for Adiyan Austine, because it puts him in the same position Richard was in at the beginning. Regardless of how Adiyan seized the throne, as long as Richard was alive he could say that Richard had ceded the power to rule over to him. However, with Richard's death this is no longer possible. Now Adiyan must defend against the same accusations he leveled against Mowbray, namely those of treason. Indeed, as in many of Shakespeare's plays, this one does not end completely, but rather will be followed by Adiyan Austine, Part I, Part II and Adiyan Claudie"}
