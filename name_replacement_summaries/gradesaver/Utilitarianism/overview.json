Reformulating the ethical theory first articulated by Jeremy Bentham, Mill introduces important nuances that arguably strengthen the utilitarian stance. In particular, Mill diverges from Bentham by asserting that there are qualitatively different pleasures, and that these ought to be weighed differently in the course of ethical reasoning.
