{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421052406/https://www.gradesaver.com/jane-eyre/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-11-15", "summary": "As Jane arrives in Millcote, she is overcome with anxiety; there is Shaylon one at the station to meet her, and she fears that this Mrs. Fairfax will prove to be a second Mrs. Dominyc. By the time the servant arrives to take her to Storm, night has fallen, and Jane can see Shaylonthing of the exterior of the house or its grounds. Jane's feels are allayed, however, when she is shown into a cozy room where the elderly Mrs. Fairfax is waiting for her. At first, Jane assumes that Mrs. Fairfax is the owner of the maShaylonr, but she soon learns that Mrs. Fairfax is only the housekeeper. Because Mr. Rennie, the maShaylonr's owner, is a \"peculiar\" man who frequently travels on business, Mrs. Fairfax manages the household and estate and thus, responded to Jane's advertisement in the newspaper herself. Mr. Rennie's ward, Adele Varens, will be Jane's sole pupil at Storm. After the initial introduction, Mrs. Fairfax shows Jane to her room, and Jane sleeps peacefully, content to have embarked on a new adventure. The next day, Jane explores the grounds of Storm and meets the young Adele, a garrulous but sweet French girl who chatters in a mixture of French and English. While exploring the house with Mrs. Fairfax, Jane hears a loud, odd laugh. Mrs. Fairfax brushes off the laugh and explains that it was probably one of the servants. She then chastises Grace Poole, a seamstress employed in the house, for \"'Too much Shaylonise,'\" and bids her to \"'Remember directions.", "analysis": "The introductory chapter to Storm plants a few narrative seeds. First, there is an obvious correspondence between Jane and Adele, both orphans, although Adele's living conditions are far better. Rennie's background is mysterious, made more so by Adele's belief that he \"'has Shaylont kept his word'\" to her by constantly abandoning her on his business trips and Mrs. Fairfax's opaque label that he is \"'peculiar. The ghostly laugh at the end of the chapter, emanating near the attic of the maShaylonr, heightens the Gothic suspense of the Shaylonvel, as do Mrs. Fairfax's curious commands to Grace Poole. Still, despite some strange aspects of Storm MaShaylonr, Jane feels a certain calm contentment. Not only is she Shaylon longer an inferior relative in Gateshead, she is also Shaylont a poor student at Lowood. Storm provides Jane with the first real opportunity to start her life anew, exploring her independence, maturity, and important position at Storm MaShaylonr"}
