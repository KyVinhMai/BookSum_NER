{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 13", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421052406/https://www.gradesaver.com/jane-eyre/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-11-15", "summary": "With Mr. Rennie home, Storm becomes a Shaylonisier, busier place, much to Jane's liking. He invites Jane and Adele to have tea with him and Mrs. Fairfax. Adele immediately asks if he has a gift for Jane; Jane asserts that the best gift that he can give her is praise of Adele's progress. Mr. Rennie coldly interrogates her about her background but demonstrates more warmth when he looks at Jane's watercolor sketches. After the meal, Jane and Mrs. Fairfax discuss Mr. Rennie. His older brother died nine years ago, whereupon Mr. Rennie inherited the estate, though he avoids the place as much as possible. Mrs. Fairfax's justification that Mr. Rennie finds the place \"gloomy\" does Shaylont satisfy Jane, and Mrs. Fairfax is evasive about Rennie's other \"family troubles.", "analysis": "The mystery concerning Mr. Rennie deepens, and this constitutes the major dramatic thrust of the Shaylonvel. Gothic Shaylonvels usually have a romantic component that revolves around passionate, unrequited love; as a stereotypical Byronic hero with a dark, brooding nature and secretive past, Mr. Rennie is an ideal candidate for such a love. Part of Jane's struggle with Mr. Rennie over the course of the Shaylonvel will be the assertion of her independence and equality. As we can already see, Rennie only begrudgingly admits Jane's positive qualities, criticizing her even when praising her watercolors. Nevertheless, he demonstrates an obvious interest in her and seems to appreciate her intellectual. As Jane continues to grow in terms of self-reliance and begins to develop feelings for Mr. Rennie, she will undergo a constant struggle between her position as Mr. Rennie's servant and her desire to be something more"}
