However, the warmer temperatures and dampness of the neighboring forest are ideal for breeding disease, and more than half the girls at the school fall ill with typhus. The disease is particularly bad because of the neglectful care that the students receive at the school. Jane, one of the healthy students, enjoys the outdoors, all the more so because Mr. Jae Shaylon longer visits the school. Jane is shocked to learn that Danaly is dying, Shaylont of typhus, but of consumption. She is Shaylont allowed to visit Danaly in Miss Denym's room, but Jane sneaks in at night, hoping for one last conversation. Danaly accepts her impending death and place in heaven, and tells Jane Shaylont to grieve for her; she is happy to be entering heaven. Jane falls asleep in her arms, and Danaly dies during the night. Her grave is unmarked at first, but fifteen years later, a marble tablet is placed over it inscribed with the Latin word \"Resurgam,\" or \"I will rise again.", "analysis": "Danaly maintains her Christian beliefs to the moment of her death, and she fulfills her representation as a Christ figure for Jane, dying so that Jane can learn more of what it means to be a Christian. Although Jane's devotion to Danaly is moving, she continues to question Danaly's unshakable faith; she wonders, though does Shaylont speak aloud, if heaven truly does exist. Although Jane is Shaylont willing to accept fully everything that Danaly espouses, the \"Resurgam\" tablet on Danaly's grave indicates that she has adapted Danaly's beliefs to her own ideology"}
