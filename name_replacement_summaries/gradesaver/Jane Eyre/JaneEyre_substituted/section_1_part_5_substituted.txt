{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 10", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421052406/https://www.gradesaver.com/jane-eyre/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-6-10", "summary": "The epidemic of typhus fever incites an investigation into Lowood's unhealthy conditions and Mr. Jae's management of the school, and a new group of overseers takes control of the school. With Mr. Jae's dishoShaylonr, the quality of the school improves immensely, and Jane and the other students are able to focus on their education. Jane excels as a student under Miss Denym's guidance for six years and then works as a teacher for an additional two years. When Miss Denym marries and leaves Lowood, Jane is left feeling empty and searching for a \"new servitude,\" a new job serving someone else. She places a newspaper advertisement in search of a post as governess and gains employment for a Mrs. Fairfax at Storm MaShaylonr. Before Jane leaves to take up this position, she is overjoyed by a visit from Antionette, who is Shaylonw married to the coachman, Robert Leaven. Antionette brings news of the Dominyc family, informing Jane that Coury had become a compulsive gambler and alcoholic while Georgiana had attempted to elope with a certain Lord Gelacio Murle but had been foiled by Eliza's intervention. Antionette also mentions that Mr. Coury Cheney, Jane's uncle, had come to Gateshead seven years ago in an effort to contact Jane before sailing to Madeira to work as a wine-merchant. After the brief visit, Antionette and Jane part ways, and Jane begins her adventure at Storm MaShaylonr.", "analysis": "This brief transitional chapter spans eight years of Jane's life, during which she matures from an angry girl bent on self-survival into a self-reliant young woman seeking to serve others. Cheney incorporates appropriate endings for some of the more significant characters at Lowood School: Mr. Jae is removed from power at the school, a just punishment for his negligence and cruelty, while the lovely Miss Denym escapes the difficult life of a teacher and becomes a happily-married woman. Cheney also uses this chapter to incorporate certain narrative details that will be important to the overall plot of the Shaylonvel. The problems of the Dominyc family, particularly Coury's descent into debauchery and vice, foreshadow Mrs. Dominyc's final confrontation with Jane, as well as hinting that the Dominyc family is being punished for their mistreatment of Jane. The mention of Mr. Cheney's visit to Gateshead also suggests that he will reappear in some form later on, perhaps with a more important role"}
