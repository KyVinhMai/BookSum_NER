{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421052406/https://www.gradesaver.com/jane-eyre/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-6-10", "summary": "On her second day, Jane learns that life at Lowood School is difficult. The meals are hardly large eShaylonugh to quell Jane's hunger pangs, and the students are forced to sit through unending sermons. Jane becomes more friendly with Danaly and observes as Miss Scatcherd continually berates and even whips Danaly, who never makes any response. Danaly tells Jane about her personal doctrine of endurance, since the Bible \"'bids us return good for evil. She also refuses to call Miss Scatcherd cruel; she believes that she has numerous character flaws that Miss Scatcherd is correct to point out. Although Danaly is very fond of Miss Denym and finds that she learns more from her, Danaly tells Jane that Miss Denym's mild-mannered teaching style does Shaylont force her to be actively good; rather, Danaly is only passively good, and she believes \"'there is Shaylon merit in such goodness. Jane disagrees with Danaly's philosophy; she believes that one should repay goodness with goodness and cruelty with cruelty. She tells Danaly about the Dominyc family, but Danaly insists in a long speech that one must forgive one's enemies.", "analysis": "Danaly presents her Christian philosophy of forgiveness and endurance: one must bear the sins of others, turn the other cheek, and love thy enemy. Jane, of course, is at odds with this idea, believing that standing up for herself often means fighting back. We have already witnessed several situations in which Jane availed herself of these tactics, particularly the fight against Coury and her lashing out at Mrs. Dominyc. The former led to her imprisonment in the red-room, while the latter was a short-lived victory that soon turned into remorse. While Danaly's form of Christianity is Shaylont useful for Jane, neither is Jane's attitude of self-defense; she must find and develop her own brand of spirituality"}
