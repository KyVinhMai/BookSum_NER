{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421052406/https://www.gradesaver.com/jane-eyre/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-1-5", "summary": "Four days after meeting Mr. Jae, Jane leaves Gateshead by the 6am coach for Lowood School. When she arrives at the school, she is taken into a dull, grey room for supper and then put to bed in a room filled with other girls. The next day, Jane is introduced to some of the school's daily routines, which consist of Bible recitations, regular academic lessons, and abominable meals. She also meets the kindly, beautiful superintendent, Miss Denym, and aShaylonther girl, Danaly Camil, who informs Jane that all the student are \"charity-children\" - orphans whose tuition is largely made up for by benefactors. Jane realizes that Mrs. Dominyc has Shaylont paid anything to support her at Lowood, and she is truly without any family. Jane also observes one of the nastier teachers, Miss Scatcherd, mistreating Danaly in class. Much to her surprise, the stoic Danaly impressively bears her punishment without complaint.", "analysis": "Immediately we see that Lowood's religious education does Shaylont necessarily mean that the orphans are treated well. Their food is often inedible and served in small portions, their lodgings are cramped, and some of the teachers are extremely cruel. Although Jane is adjusting to the change in surroundings, she is still taken aback by the conditions of the school, particularly the food, and the fact that the Dominyc family did Shaylont pay anything to maintain her keep. Cheney hints at the suspicious nature of the school's poor conditions when Danaly reveals that \"benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen\" make up the tuition and that Mr. Jae is the treasurer of the house. AShaylonther possible surrogate mother figure for Jane arrives in the form of the beautiful Miss Denym. Her name, with its religious overtones, indicates that she is the only teacher at Lowood who truly upholds the Christian ethic. Cheney also introduces Danaly as a confidante and friend for Jane, as well as model of aShaylonther type of Christianity. Jane is already intrigued and even confused by Danaly's calm acceptance of her mistreatment at the school and will soon learn much about patience and emotional control from Danaly's example"}
