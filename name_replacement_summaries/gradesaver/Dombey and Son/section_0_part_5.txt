Mrs. Chick suggests that Miss Tox be made Paul's godmother, and Mr. Dombey agrees, although he makes it clear that he does not want anyone to ever act as a rival for Paul's affection and chooses Miss Tox because she is inoffensive and uninteresting. The night, Miss Tox and Mrs. Chick sit in the nursery and discuss Florence, who they believe will never gain her father's affection. Waking up and overhearing this, Florence is distressed and asks to be put in bed with her brother, because she clings to the fact that at least Paul loves her. After Miss Tox and Mrs. Chick leave, Miss Nipper expresses her anger at them for so blatantly favoring Paul. Shortly afterwards on a cold and dismal day, Paul's christening takes place. As part of the celebrations, Mr. Dombey announces that he has paid for Polly's eldest son to attend a charity school known as the Charitable Grinders. While Polly tries to be grateful, she is saddened to think of her son, whom she has not seen for a long time. Nipper suggests that she, Richards, and Florence go to visit Richards's family. Richards hesitates, but then agrees", "analysis": "The opening chapters introduce the web of characters whose lives will intersect over the course of the novel. Several of the major themes immediately become clear. A number of different family dynamics are presented and contrasted. Mr. Dombey is able to give his children economic privilege and elevated social standing, but he also sees them as projections of his own ego. He values his infant son because of the potential for continuing a family legacy, and is not only disinterested in, but also actively jealous of Florence. On the other hand, the Toodle family, or Uncle Sol and his nephew Walter, while in much more precarious economic straits, and in fact dependent on the Dombeys for their income, show much more genuine love. The idea of families being created from unlikely combinations of individuals, which will reoccur as eclectic groups of characters form bonds throughout the novel, takes root as it becomes clear that Susan Nipper and Richards are the ones actually providing love to Florence and Paul. At the same time, their position as working-class employees ensures that they are viewed with suspicion: Mr. Dombey insists on isolating Richards from her family, and even renaming her, because he fears what influence she might have on Paul. Efforts to insulate the Dombey children, however, prove unsuccessful. There is an irony to the impetus for the catastrophic expedition to Stagg's Garden: a misguided belief on Dombey's part that he is benefiting Biler Toodle by providing him with some form of education only makes his mother more aware of the poignancy of him growing up without her. Not only the decision to leave the Dombey mansion, but also to take the children to a working class neighborhood, would be a direct reflection of Dombey's worst fears for his son. And while Florence does indeed have a traumatic experience, her horizon is also permanently broadened by the contact she makes with Walter and his uncle. Without this serendipity, she would almost certainly never have encountered someone from so far outside of her own social position. Despite Dombey's attempts to control his children, just as he controls his business, the complex social and economic web around him will still impact his life."}
