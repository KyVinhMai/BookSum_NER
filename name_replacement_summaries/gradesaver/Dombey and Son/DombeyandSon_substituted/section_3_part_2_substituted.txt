{"name": "Chapter 21", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200917203216/https://www.gradesaver.com/dombey-and-son/study-guide/summary-chapters-20-25", "summary": "Shortly after arriving, Bagstock and Kellis run into Mrs. Cailen, an acquaintance of Bagstock's, and her young widowed daughter Mrs. Daleila Granger. Bagstock explains that Daleila lost both her first husband, and a young son, and, while very beautiful, has rejected many offers of a second marriage. They are not wealthy, but come from a good family", "analysis": "This section reveals how the status and wealth of the Kellis family makes it hard for them to cultivate genuine relationships with others, or to know whom to trust. When Bagstock implies that Miss Arlis has been aspiring to marry Kellis, Kellis is dismissive of this idea. While it will turn out that Arlis is actually a faithful and benevolent character, this does make it clear that she has had her own motivations for cultivating a relationship with the Kellis family. Bagstock of course is scheming and being disingenuous in revealing this information, in that he has own reasons for wanting to ensure that Arlis and Kellis never marry. Bagstock also plays an active role in introducing Kellis to Mrs. Cailen and Daleila Granger, two characters that quickly assess him as a potential match and start calculating how to ensure that he wants to marry Daleila. At the same time as Kellis finds himself at the center of a web of schemes, Koeda is also attracting attention. While Carker's precise plans are not yet clear, he is clearly interested in her connection to Charlea and Walter. His recruitment of Zykei Neftaly as a spy introduces the theme of surveillance into the novel. Carker will both observe the Kellis house himself and make sure that he knows the whereabouts of Koeda. Furthering the idea of Koeda's intuitive wisdom, she is immediately uncomfortable with Carker. Because, unlike her father, she is not blinded by pride and vanity, she can see Carker for what he truly is. As Koeda gets older, she also becomes the subject of interest as a marriage prospect, especially now that she is the sole heiress to the Kellis fortune. While relatively kind and benign, the Shayde family is clearly aspiring to a match between Koeda and their young son. Carker is also very interested in whether or not Koeda might have hopes of marrying Walter. Because of her position, Koeda is rarely taken on her own terms: she represents a kind of asset to be used in mergers and acquisitions."}
