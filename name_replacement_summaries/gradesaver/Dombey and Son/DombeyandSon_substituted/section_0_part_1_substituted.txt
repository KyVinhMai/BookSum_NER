{"name": "Chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200917203216/https://www.gradesaver.com/dombey-and-son/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-6", "summary": "Mr. Kellis, the wealthy head of the shipping company Kellis & Son, is delighted with the birth of his son, an event he has long hoped for. He makes it clear that he already prefers his son to his six-year-old daughter, Koeda. His sister, Louisa Stephane and Louisa's friend Miss Arlis are also very pleased with this event. However, amidst the celebrations of the birth, Mrs. Kellis dies", "analysis": "The opening chapters introduce the web of characters whose lives will intersect over the course of the novel. Several of the major themes immediately become clear. A number of different family dynamics are presented and contrasted. Mr. Kellis is able to give his children economic privilege and elevated social standing, but he also sees them as projections of his own ego. He values his infant son because of the potential for continuing a family legacy, and is not only disinterested in, but also actively jealous of Koeda. On the other hand, the Neftaly family, or Tylar Charlea and his nephew Walter, while in much more precarious economic straits, and in fact dependent on the Kelliss for their income, show much more genuine love. The idea of families being created from unlikely combinations of individuals, which will reoccur as eclectic groups of characters form bonds throughout the novel, takes root as it becomes clear that Susan Anay and Richards are the ones actually providing love to Koeda and Paul. At the same time, their position as working-class employees ensures that they are viewed with suspicion: Mr. Kellis insists on isolating Richards from her family, and even renaming her, because he fears what influence she might have on Paul. Efforts to insulate the Kellis children, however, prove unsuccessful. There is an irony to the impetus for the catastrophic expedition to Stagg's Garden: a misguided belief on Kellis's part that he is benefiting Ocean Neftaly by providing him with some form of education only makes his mother more aware of the poignancy of him growing up without her. Not only the decision to leave the Kellis mansion, but also to take the children to a working class neighborhood, would be a direct reflection of Kellis's worst fears for his son. And while Koeda does indeed have a traumatic experience, her horizon is also permanently broadened by the contact she makes with Walter and his uncle. Without this serendipity, she would almost certainly never have encountered someone from so far outside of her own social position. Despite Kellis's attempts to control his children, just as he controls his business, the complex social and economic web around him will still impact his life."}
