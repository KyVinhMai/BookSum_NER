McMurdo continues to rise in the organization. One Saturday night before the lodge meeting, Morris comes to see McMurdo. He is visibly afraid and anxious and says he has a secret that is burning inside him. He finally bursts out that a detective is on the union's trail. Astonished, McMurdo says there are always people trying to get them. Morris replies that it is one of the infamous Pinkerton detectives and is thus very serious. McMurdo earnestly grabs Morris and says he must tell him everything. Morris explains he had a friend back East who sent a telegram asking how the Scowrers were doing, and noting that he heard the Pinkertons and their best detective, Birdy Edwards, were on the case. McMurdo feels as if an abyss is before him. He asks if Morris would know what this Edwards looked like and Morris says no; even his friend would not know this. McMurdo suddenly bursts out that he knows who it is, and vows to take of it. To Morris's relief he says he will leave Morris's name out of whatever happens next. Before the meeting McMurdo tells Ettie he is finally ready to go, and to wait for his word soon. That night the meeting commences. McMurdo stands up and declares he has a matter of urgency. This quiets everyone down; the rules state everyone must heed this business before anything else. McMurdo explains that he has a letter telling him of Edwards and the Pinkertons, and that he knows exactly who the man is. A ripple of astonishment and fear sweeps the hall. McGinty says the man must not be allowed to leave the valley. McMurdo agrees and asks leave to form a committee to discuss the plan. That night the lodge's revelry is subdued; for the first time the men see the arm of the law reaching closer to them. McGinty, McMurdo, Baldwin, and the other men selected for the committee meet to discuss the plan. McMurdo identifies the man as Steve Wilson, lodging at Hobson's Patch; Wilson was pretending to be a reporter. McMurdo then says his plan is to go to Wilson with his \"secrets\" of the Lodge for a price. This could happen at the trusty Widow MacNamara's house. The seven men will meet there by nine; Edwards will show up, and they will take care of him", "analysis": "The novel comes to a close with the revelation that McMurdo, Birdy Edwards, and John Douglas are all the same person; it also adds a disturbing coda in that Moriarty has Douglas killed on behalf of the Scowrers who hired him. Moriarty's involvement seems a little flimsy, but it emphasizes how connected, efficient, and deadly the Professor actually is. However, anyone hoping to learn more about Holmes's enigmatic foe is bound to be disappointed. Critic Catherine Wynne ties this in to the larger Irish issue: \"Occlusion of criminal Irishness is more explicit when we examine Moriarty's faction, which retains its decidedly nebulous and pernicious quality throughout the canon. Moriarty's organization is never defined, never named.\" She thinks Holmes's explanation of how Moriarty was involved is unsatisfactory and \"that the master criminal's reputation rests on the annihilation of a middle-aged and retired Pinkerton detective is improbable or indeed spurious. Rather, Moriarty's desire for Douglas' death is based upon Moriarty's alignment with American, and by extension Irish, secret societies, notably Fenianism and its counterpart Clann-na-Gael. Doyle, then, is unobtrusively allying Moriarty and his criminal organization with Irish physical force separatism.\" Wynne connects Moriarty's shady organization to that of criminal Irish groups. This aligns with how Holmes describes Moriarty's modus operandi: \"I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death\" . However, this is not a blanket condemnation of all Irish organizations or the Irish nationalist groups. Wynne writes of how Doyle's entire oeuvre is a move toward rapprochement with his Irish lineage. The \"early short stories examine militant Irish nationalism while attempting some understanding of the social conditions that propagate such extreme political movements. The Holmes stories investigate the nature of the secret society: Moriarty's criminal gang, the Pennsylvanian Scowrers who invoke Irish Molly Maguireism and finally Fenianism\"; Moriarty is the link to Fenianism, and he challenges the detective in the same way Irish militancy posed a challenge for Doyle. Ultimately, though, after The Valley of Fear, the story \"The Final Bow,\" Wynne says, \"finally shatters the concept of identarian unity and racial purity.\" Holmes leaves off his detective work and \"Doyle retreats into the world of spiritualism--a world where the conflicting demands of British imperialism and Irish nationalism would have no place.\" Finally, the last chapters give readers an interesting moral question in whether or not McMurdo's undercover actions are justified, and he answers this to an extent when he says, \"Maybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they like, as long as I get you\" and \"there's many a thousand that will call me a deliverer that went down to hell to save them\" . McMurdo beat, terrorized, and perhaps even killed, but he justifies this by saying that it is all for the greater good. And it is indeed difficult, given such a black-and-white depiction of the Scowrers, to defend those whom McMurdo deceived."}
