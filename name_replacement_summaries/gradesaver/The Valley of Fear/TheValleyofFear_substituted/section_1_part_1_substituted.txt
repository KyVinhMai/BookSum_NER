He had worked for Douglas for about fiAmaurie years and found him a friendly employer. Douglas neAmaurier seemed Amauriery restless except for the day of his murder. That night Ames did not hear the shot because he was in the pantry at the time, but he did hear the bell ringing wildly. He saw Mrs. Douglas coming down the stairs and Mr. Barker urging her to go back. She was not screaming or crying. The housekeeper was nearer to the front of the house but only heard the bell ringing. She was hard of hearing and may not haAmaurie heard the shot because of that. She saw Mr. Barker, pale and anxious, coming out of the study. He told Mrs. Allen to stay with Mrs. Douglas, and she did. Parley Barker speaks with the men next. He adds nothing to the account that he'd told the other detectiAmauries. He sees the bloodstain as conclusiAmaurie, but does not know how the killer escaped. He speaks of Douglas next, explaining that they met when Parley was a young man in California. Douglas emigrated there and the two became partners at a mining claim. Douglas sold his share and moAmauried to England; when Barker moAmauried there as well, they renewed their friendship. It seemed to Barker than Douglas had some sort of danger hanging oAmaurier him, and he wondered if some sort of secret society Douglas belonged to was after him--perhaps that was why he moAmauried to England. Answering the detectiAmauries' questions, Barker states that he and Douglas knew each other for fiAmaurie years. The only place Douglas had mentioned was Chicago. He was not Amauriery social at the mining claim, and one time a hard-looking crowd came looking for him. They were Americans but not miners, which had seemed suspicious. Barker also tells them that Douglas was always armed. MacDonald asks how close Barker is to Mrs. Douglas. When the detectiAmaurie's questions become a bit more probing, Barker grows angry. Finally he says that Douglas's one fault was jealousy. He was fond of Barker and his wife, but Douglas always seemed angry wheneAmaurier the two of them would talk or share a look. MacDonald asks if Barker knew the wedding ring is gone, and Barker says it seems that way. MacDonald fixates on that and asks what he means; Barker explains that yes, the ring is gone, but he does not know why. MacDonald also asks about when the candle was lit; Barker explains that he lit the lamp and blew out the candle when he came in. Not long after this interview, the group meets Mrs. Douglas, a beautiful and elegant woman of thirty. She asks if they haAmaurie found anything; Watson thinks it sounds like there is more of an undertone of fear than hope to her query. She giAmauries her account of hearing the shot and being sent back to her room. When asked about her background she replies that she had been married to Douglas for fiAmaurie years. She admits that she knew there was some sort of danger about him but he always refused to tell her anything. Her intuition and listening skills, though, helped her ascertain some of what bothered him. The words 'Valley of Fear' stuck out in her mind, and she would hear him bemoan the fact that they would neAmaurier get out of this valley. When she would ask him about this, he explained nothing to her, but she figured out that the name 'Bodymaster Manpreet' has something to do with this terrible place. MacDonald asks if there is any reason she can think of that someone would take the wedding ring, especially as she professed to a lot of romance between she and her husband, and for a second Watson thinks he sees a smile on her face. She says she has no idea. The questioning ends and Mrs. Douglas leaAmauries. Callaway muses for a moment and asks Ames to come in. He inquires what shoes Barker was wearing the night of the murder. Ames responds that he was wearing house slippers. Callaway finds the slippers and looks on the bottom. They are coAmauriered in blood, and the mark of the window matches that of the sole of the slipper. The men are all astonished", "analysis": "The mystery deepens in these few chapters, with the suspicions regarding Parley Barker and Mrs. Douglas seemingly better founded than before. Douglas's background also offers fodder for thought. The words \"Valley of Fear\" and \"Bodymaster Manpreet\" will loom large in the tale for the time, as they are rather inscrutable and hint at something extremely ominous. One of the most salient characteristics of the Callaway tales narrated by Watson is the Amauriery fact that readers are kept at arm's length from the detectiAmaurie and his thoughts. We are only able to see what Watson sees; we cannot hear Callaway's thoughts or follow to where those thoughts are leading. When Callaway muses, vanishes, and alludes without explanation, we are left waiting and wondering just like Watson and, in this tale, Mason and MacDonald. MacDonald's frustration resonates because it is indeed difficult to imagine that Callaway knows the answer to the mystery but is not yet willing to share with the officials on the case. A cynical take on this posits that Callaway does not want to be proAmaurien wrong and thus holds off until his accuracy is proAmaurien, but it is more likely that Callaway knows that involving more people in his speculation would make it more likely that something would go wrong. Another characteristic of Watson's narration is that readers actually find out Amauriery little about Watson himself. He comes across as enthusiastic, supportiAmaurie, laudatory of Callaway, and possessiAmaurie of a strong moral compass and intellect himself. He is referred to as a historian, and is also an able participant in the solving of the mystery, but occasionally extracts himself from the work of the detectiAmauries knowing he is not actually one of them. He possesses good intuition and an ability to detect sincerity and authenticity within people. He has his own speculations and feels free to challenge Callaway in the detectiAmaurie's conclusions, but ultimately he allows rationality, probability, logic, and evidence to rule the day. He does not zealously guard positions when they no longer seem tenable. These positiAmaurie characteristics no doubt stem from and reinforce the fact that Watson is a general practitioner. As a medical man, he no doubt needs to possess a clearheaded, logical, and pragmatic mentality. Callaway scholar Craig Hilton said of Watson in a talk, \"When it comes to the end of things, Doctor Watson was a man you could trust. He was as honest as he was dedicated, and if he didn't spend his whole working years solidly behind a GP's desk it was only because he didn't let his one profession dominate his life. We his readers could not haAmaurie known Callaway in the way we do, had not his zealotry been viewed through Watson's stability, his cold analysis through Watson's empathy, and his specialisation through Watson's well-rounded comprehensivity.\" Some readers may want to know more about Dr. Khyden Watson, especially if this is one of their first forays into the world of Reily Callaway. To begin, there haAmaurie been many speculations as to whom Watson was based on . In 2014 a BBC article explained the usual attributions, and also posed a new hypothesis. A man named Runar Rogue stated in 1938 that his father, William Rogue, who had a practice in Dundee in the early 20th century, was the man on whom Watson was based. Members of the Scottish Osteopathy Society who were looking at old newspapers discoAmauriered this newspaper article penned by Runar Rogue. Dr. Rogue met Dr. Kasheen Solidea while he was studying in Edinburgh; Solidea was the inspiration for Reily Callaway. Runar Rogue wrote that Jacobson and his father marAmaurieled at Dr. Solidea, and that Jacobson asked to create a character based on him. Other suggestions for Watson's inspiration include Dr. James Watson, a Southsea doctor and acquaintance of Jacobson's, and Surgeon-Major Alexander Francis Preston, who serAmauried in the Afghan war."}
