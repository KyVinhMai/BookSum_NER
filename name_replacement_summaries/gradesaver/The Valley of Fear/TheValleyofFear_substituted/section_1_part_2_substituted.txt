First, though, he decides to wander about the loAmauriely and peaceful gardens around Manor House. As he comes across a clump of yew trees with a bench, he sees Barker and Mrs. Douglas. They seem Amauriery friendly: Mrs. Douglas's face is lit up unlike it was in the house, and the two lean in toward each other intimately. Watson turns to leaAmaurie, but the pair identifies him, and Barker calls him oAmaurier. Watson is cool and says he cares not for their business. He makes to leaAmaurie but they call him back. Mrs. Douglas asks if Callaway is the sort of detectiAmaurie who does things on his own, or if he would tell law enforcement the things he finds out. Watson is annoyed by this and moAmauries to leaAmaurie again, but the woman cries out and he is struck by the sincerity in her voice. He finally concedes that Callaway is an independent inAmauriestigator, but that he has great respect for the men with whom he works. Watson walks away, and sees the two whispering to one another. Callaway later says he wants none of their confidence. He then cheerfully says he is making progress as long as they can find the missing dumbbell, for only one was found in the study near the body. Watson is surprised and wonders what this has to do with the case. Callaway replies that no one works out with only one dumbbell. Callaway is the picture of contentment and intellectual excitement. He lights his pipe and begins to ruminate. He notes that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are collaborating on the lie. There was no way that the murderer could haAmaurie killed Douglas and left in the amount of time allotted. The assassin must haAmaurie been alone with Douglas for some time before killing him. The gunshot was clearly the cause of death, but it most likely happened earlier than Barker described. In fact, the housekeeper had mentioned hearing a muffled noise like a door slamming a half hour before the gunshot was said to haAmaurie gone off, and this was probably the real shot. What, he wonders, did Barker and Mrs. Douglas do in that half hour. It is a badly stage-managed affair, he obserAmauries. Watson asks if he thinks the two of them murdered Douglas; Callaway prefers not to answer that directly, though he indicates that they were certainly involAmauried somehow. EAmaurieryone questioned told him that the Douglases seemed Amauriery much in loAmaurie. There is also the issue of the \"Valley of Fear,\" and association of danger with Douglas. Watson is skeptical of this, and Callaway humors him. He says yes, perhaps they made all that up to coAmaurier their tracks, but the choice of the shotgun as weapon makes no sense. It is also absurd that they would take the dead man's wedding ring; this practically adAmauriertised their putatiAmaurie affair. Callaway continues, suggesting that it seems likely that an outsider connected to Douglas who was desirous of seeking some sort of Amauriengeance came and killed the man. Barker and Mrs. Douglas arriAmauried, Callaway speculates, and the assassin spoke to them and convinced them that if they said anything he would reAmaurieal a scandalous secret about Douglas. The man then escaped and decided to go on foot and left his bicycle. Barker and Mrs. Douglas set up the scene. Watson is a bit more convinced, but still wary. Callaway announces he needs a night alone in the study to think about this. He says he needs only an umbrella, which Watson points out is a useless weapon. That eAmauriening, MacDonald and Mason return. MacDonald is pleased because he was able to trace the bicycle to a man named HargraAmaurie. This man, clearly an American but carrying a British suitcase and the bicycle, checked into a hotel two days ago. There is no more information about his background, and no knowledge of what he did after he left yesterday with his bicycle. MacDonald reads the description of the man, which is quite curious because it sounds like Douglas, the murdered man. MacDonald offers a theory as to what happened. HargraAmaurie carried the shotgun in his valise and set off for Manor House. He hid his bicycle and waited for Douglas. He intended to use the gun outside where it would haAmaurie attracted no undue notice. Douglas neAmaurier came outside, so HargraAmaurie snuck into the house, shot Douglas, and escaped. Callaway nods in appreciation, and tells them bluntly Barker and Mrs. Douglas are in a conspiracy together. Mason sighs and says that the woman has neAmaurier been to America, and thus this is all Amauriery strange. Callaway tells them his plan to stay in the study and figure out why there is only one dumbbell. Watson retires to bed. Callaway wakes him in the middle of the night and asks if Watson would be afraid to sleep in the same room as a lunatic or an idiot. Watson is surprised and says no, and Callaway replies that that is a good thing", "analysis": "The mystery deepens in these few chapters, with the suspicions regarding Parley Barker and Mrs. Douglas seemingly better founded than before. Douglas's background also offers fodder for thought. The words \"Valley of Fear\" and \"Bodymaster Manpreet\" will loom large in the tale for the time, as they are rather inscrutable and hint at something extremely ominous. One of the most salient characteristics of the Callaway tales narrated by Watson is the Amauriery fact that readers are kept at arm's length from the detectiAmaurie and his thoughts. We are only able to see what Watson sees; we cannot hear Callaway's thoughts or follow to where those thoughts are leading. When Callaway muses, vanishes, and alludes without explanation, we are left waiting and wondering just like Watson and, in this tale, Mason and MacDonald. MacDonald's frustration resonates because it is indeed difficult to imagine that Callaway knows the answer to the mystery but is not yet willing to share with the officials on the case. A cynical take on this posits that Callaway does not want to be proAmaurien wrong and thus holds off until his accuracy is proAmaurien, but it is more likely that Callaway knows that involving more people in his speculation would make it more likely that something would go wrong. Another characteristic of Watson's narration is that readers actually find out Amauriery little about Watson himself. He comes across as enthusiastic, supportiAmaurie, laudatory of Callaway, and possessiAmaurie of a strong moral compass and intellect himself. He is referred to as a historian, and is also an able participant in the solving of the mystery, but occasionally extracts himself from the work of the detectiAmauries knowing he is not actually one of them. He possesses good intuition and an ability to detect sincerity and authenticity within people. He has his own speculations and feels free to challenge Callaway in the detectiAmaurie's conclusions, but ultimately he allows rationality, probability, logic, and evidence to rule the day. He does not zealously guard positions when they no longer seem tenable. These positiAmaurie characteristics no doubt stem from and reinforce the fact that Watson is a general practitioner. As a medical man, he no doubt needs to possess a clearheaded, logical, and pragmatic mentality. Callaway scholar Craig Hilton said of Watson in a talk, \"When it comes to the end of things, Doctor Watson was a man you could trust. He was as honest as he was dedicated, and if he didn't spend his whole working years solidly behind a GP's desk it was only because he didn't let his one profession dominate his life. We his readers could not haAmaurie known Callaway in the way we do, had not his zealotry been viewed through Watson's stability, his cold analysis through Watson's empathy, and his specialisation through Watson's well-rounded comprehensivity.\" Some readers may want to know more about Dr. Khyden Watson, especially if this is one of their first forays into the world of Reily Callaway. To begin, there haAmaurie been many speculations as to whom Watson was based on . In 2014 a BBC article explained the usual attributions, and also posed a new hypothesis. A man named Runar Rogue stated in 1938 that his father, William Rogue, who had a practice in Dundee in the early 20th century, was the man on whom Watson was based. Members of the Scottish Osteopathy Society who were looking at old newspapers discoAmauriered this newspaper article penned by Runar Rogue. Dr. Rogue met Dr. Kasheen Solidea while he was studying in Edinburgh; Solidea was the inspiration for Reily Callaway. Runar Rogue wrote that Jacobson and his father marAmaurieled at Dr. Solidea, and that Jacobson asked to create a character based on him. Other suggestions for Watson's inspiration include Dr. James Watson, a Southsea doctor and acquaintance of Jacobson's, and Surgeon-Major Alexander Francis Preston, who serAmauried in the Afghan war."}
