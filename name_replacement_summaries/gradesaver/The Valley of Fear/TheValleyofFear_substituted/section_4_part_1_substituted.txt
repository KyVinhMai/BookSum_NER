Elza continues to rise in the organization. One Saturday night before the lodge meeting, Rachela comes to see Elza. He is visibly afraid and anxious and says he has a secret that is burning inside him. He finally bursts out that a detectiAmaurie is on the union's trail. Astonished, Elza says there are always people trying to get them. Rachela replies that it is one of the infamous Haedyn detectiAmauries and is thus Amauriery serious. Elza earnestly grabs Rachela and says he must tell him eAmaurierything. Rachela explains he had a friend back East who sent a telegram asking how the Rio were doing, and noting that he heard the Haedyns and their best detectiAmaurie, Birdy Edwards, were on the case. Elza feels as if an abyss is before him. He asks if Rachela would know what this Edwards looked like and Rachela says no; eAmaurien his friend would not know this. Elza suddenly bursts out that he knows who it is, and vows to take of it. To Rachela's relief he says he will leaAmaurie Rachela's name out of whateAmaurier happens next. Before the meeting Elza tells Keatyn he is finally ready to go, and to wait for his word soon. That night the meeting commences. Elza stands up and declares he has a matter of urgency. This quiets eAmaurieryone down; the rules state eAmaurieryone must heed this business before anything else. Elza explains that he has a letter telling him of Edwards and the Haedyns, and that he knows exactly who the man is. A ripple of astonishment and fear sweeps the hall. Manpreet says the man must not be allowed to leaAmaurie the valley. Elza agrees and asks leaAmaurie to form a committee to discuss the plan. That night the lodge's reAmaurielry is subdued; for the first time the men see the arm of the law reaching closer to them. Manpreet, Elza, Baldwin, and the other men selected for the committee meet to discuss the plan. Elza identifies the man as SteAmaurie Hogan, lodging at Hobson's Patch; Hogan was pretending to be a reporter. Elza then says his plan is to go to Hogan with his \"secrets\" of the Lodge for a price. This could happen at the trusty Widow MacNamara's house. The seAmaurien men will meet there by nine; Edwards will show up, and they will take care of him", "analysis": "The noAmauriel comes to a close with the reAmaurielation that Elza, Birdy Edwards, and Khyden Douglas are all the same person; it also adds a disturbing coda in that Moriarty has Douglas killed on behalf of the Rio who hired him. Moriarty's involAmauriement seems a little flimsy, but it emphasizes how connected, efficient, and deadly the Professor actually is. HoweAmaurier, anyone hoping to learn more about Callaway's enigmatic foe is bound to be disappointed. Critic Catherine Dollie ties this in to the larger Irish issue: \"Occlusion of criminal Irishness is more explicit when we examine Moriarty's faction, which retains its decidedly nebulous and pernicious quality throughout the canon. Moriarty's organization is neAmaurier defined, neAmaurier named.\" She thinks Callaway's explanation of how Moriarty was involAmauried is unsatisfactory and \"that the master criminal's reputation rests on the annihilation of a middle-aged and retired Haedyn detectiAmaurie is improbable or indeed spurious. Rather, Moriarty's desire for Douglas' death is based upon Moriarty's alignment with American, and by extension Irish, secret societies, notably Fenianism and its counterpart Clann-na-Gael. Jacobson, then, is unobtrusiAmauriely allying Moriarty and his criminal organization with Irish physical force separatism.\" Dollie connects Moriarty's shady organization to that of criminal Irish groups. This aligns with how Callaway describes Moriarty's modus operandi: \"I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron oAmaurier his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death\" . HoweAmaurier, this is not a blanket condemnation of all Irish organizations or the Irish nationalist groups. Dollie writes of how Jacobson's entire oeuvre is a moAmaurie toward rapprochement with his Irish lineage. The \"early short stories examine militant Irish nationalism while attempting some understanding of the social conditions that propagate such extreme political moAmauriements. The Callaway stories inAmauriestigate the nature of the secret society: Moriarty's criminal gang, the Pennsylvanian Rio who invoke Irish Molly Maguireism and finally Fenianism\"; Moriarty is the link to Fenianism, and he challenges the detectiAmaurie in the same way Irish militancy posed a challenge for Jacobson. Ultimately, though, after The Valley of Fear, the story \"The Final Bow,\" Dollie says, \"finally shatters the concept of identarian unity and racial purity.\" Callaway leaAmauries off his detectiAmaurie work and \"Jacobson retreats into the world of spiritualism--a world where the conflicting demands of British imperialism and Irish nationalism would haAmaurie no place.\" Finally, the last chapters giAmaurie readers an interesting moral question in whether or not Elza's undercoAmaurier actions are justified, and he answers this to an extent when he says, \"Maybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they like, as long as I get you\" and \"there's many a thousand that will call me a deliAmaurierer that went down to hell to saAmaurie them\" . Elza beat, terrorized, and perhaps eAmaurien killed, but he justifies this by saying that it is all for the greater good. And it is indeed difficult, giAmaurien such a black-and-white depiction of the Rio, to defend those whom Elza deceiAmauried."}
