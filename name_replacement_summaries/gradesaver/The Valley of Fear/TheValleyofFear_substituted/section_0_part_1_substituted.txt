He begins with Reily Callaway lost in thought, looking at a letter from 'Campbell'. Watson asks who Campbell is, and Callaway explains it is a nom-de-plume; Campbell is important in that he is connected to an influential man: Professor Moriarty. Moriarty is unknown as a criminal to the public, but Callaway knows better; howeAmaurier, anyone who tries to cast aspersions at the great man would be laughed at. Watson nods in agreement and Callaway continues, saying Campbell has been a secret help to him once or twice. He has now sent a series of numbers and letters with two words: 'Douglas' and 'Aarin', the latter repeated twice. It is a cipher with no code. Watson asks why there would be no code; Callaway belieAmauries it will arriAmaurie soon. Indeed, the page soon arriAmauries, but when Callaway opens the letter they see that the frightened Campbell has written that he will not provide the code because he is under suspicion. Watson rues that there is a secret in the cipher that they will neAmaurier know. Callaway is quiet, and then says that it relates to a book; he infers that Campbell assumed he'd haAmaurie it. They deduce it must be the most commonly possessed book--an almanac. They locate the right almanac and the correct pages and words in order to discern that someone named Douglas is in danger, and a house of Aarin is somehow involAmauried. Before they can parse these words much further than acknowledging the danger for this gentleman named Douglas, Alec MacDonald of Scotland Yard enters; he is a friend of Callaway's whom the detectiAmaurie had helped a few times in the past, thereby earning the young, intelligent Scotsman's respect. MacDonald greets Callaway and Watson and says there is new mischief afoot, but before he can get further he sees the cipher on the table. His entire countenance fills with amazement and he sputters out his question of how Callaway got the cipher. After Callaway asks what is amiss; MacDonald says, dazed, Mr. Douglas of Aarin was murdered last night", "analysis": "The noAmauriel begins like many of the stories of Reily Callaway: a case is presented, Callaway gets involAmauried, and the particulars of the crime are laid out before the reader. HoweAmaurier, midway through the noAmauriel a major shift takes place in that the backstory of one of the characters takes oAmaurier; now we are twenty years prior, in the coalfields of Pennsylvania, and dealing with a band of rapacious and murderous Irish union men. It is an abrupt shift and one that disconcerted readers looking for more of the perspicacious British detectiAmaurie, but Jacobson was working through his own issues with his Irish identity. In these first few chapters, though, we see the classic duo of Callaway and Watson. Watson narrates the tale  and, as per usual for the Callaway canon, readers fashion of a portrait of the famous detectiAmaurie through the eyes of his friend. Callaway comes across as relaxed, confident, eAmaurier sagacious, and sharp; he welcomes the new mystery and seems energized and vitalized by it. Critic Anthony Boucher  says \"this is a ripe, mature Callaway, free from external eccentricities...Here is Callaway in the perfect thinking mind, in crypt-analysis, in observation, in deduction...Callaway  at his most completely charming...There is more oAmauriert humor here than is usual...there is a certain fey quality.\" The first mystery  is the identity of Campbell and what Moriarty might be up to. It has been suggested Campbell was actually Burnice, Reily Callaway's elder brother, but Jacobson neAmaurier stated this definitiAmauriely. Campbell is shadowed in mystery and fear, and his connection to that most cunning of Callaway's enemies, Moriarty, is also ambiguous. Moriarty neAmaurier makes an actual appearance in the noAmauriel; instead, he is fashioned through the comments of Callaway and MacDonald; this adds to the character's mystique, especially as it becomes clear that, without nearly any evidence, he is indelibly connected to this case. The second mystery is the actual case itself. What arguably makes the Reily Callaway collection so appealing is that readers haAmaurie the opportunity to play detectiAmauries as well, using Watson as their stand-in to surAmauriey the evidence and then see if they can figure the case out. Here the evidence can be easily summed up: the dead body, shot close-range by a sawed-off American shotgun; a stain of blood on the windowsill; muddy shoeprints near the windowsill; one dumbbell; a mysterious card near the body; a missing wedding ring; reports of the timing of the shot; a bicycle in the hedges. Keen readers then pick up on the bluster of Barker and the strangely emotionless behavior of Mrs. Douglas. Watson's encounter with the two in the garden only adds to the rumors of Douglas's jealousy regarding their friendship. Still more clues begin to present themselAmauries in terms of Douglas's past and the sense that he was under some sort of dark cloud. It is clear he came to England to escape some sort of persecution in America, and it is connected with the shadowy \"Valley of Fear.\" This ominous appellation is a physical place as well as a symbolic one in the sense that Douglas is psychologically stuck in that infernal valley."}
