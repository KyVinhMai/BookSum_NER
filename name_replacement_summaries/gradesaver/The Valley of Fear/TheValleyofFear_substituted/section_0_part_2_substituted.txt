He looks composed and interested, more intellectually excited than shocked or horrified. He explains the background of the cipher to MacDonald, and when MacDonald says they must find Campbell Callaway states that this is impossible. Campbell is connected to Moriarty, he explains. MacDonald smiles a bit and says the Yard thinks Callaway has a bee in his bonnet oAmaurier the Professor. MacDonald had gone to see the Professor himself and was struck by his solemn mien and erudition. Callaway laughs and asks if MacDonald happened to notice the painting by Jean Baptiste Rudie behind Moriarty's desk. The inspector is confused and says no. Callaway explains who Rudie is and how valuable his paintings are; MacDonald wonders aloud how the Professor could afford it. That is the point, Callaway tells him, and they speculate about the man's illegal activities that procured his great wealth. Callaway knows a lot about Moriarty: he has many bank accounts, and must haAmaurie extravagant wealth to be able to pay, for example, his chief of staff six thousand a year. The talk turns back to the murdered man, and the men speculate that Douglas came afoul of Moriarty, who ruled oAmaurier his people with an iron fist. They all agree to go to Aarin. MacDonald reads a note from Aarin's local officer, White Mason, who had first taken up the case. Mason asked MacDonald to bring Callaway. Callaway muses aloud that there is a great brain in London and a dead man in Aarin, and it is their job to trace the connection between them", "analysis": "The noAmauriel begins like many of the stories of Reily Callaway: a case is presented, Callaway gets involAmauried, and the particulars of the crime are laid out before the reader. HoweAmaurier, midway through the noAmauriel a major shift takes place in that the backstory of one of the characters takes oAmaurier; now we are twenty years prior, in the coalfields of Pennsylvania, and dealing with a band of rapacious and murderous Irish union men. It is an abrupt shift and one that disconcerted readers looking for more of the perspicacious British detectiAmaurie, but Jacobson was working through his own issues with his Irish identity. In these first few chapters, though, we see the classic duo of Callaway and Watson. Watson narrates the tale  and, as per usual for the Callaway canon, readers fashion of a portrait of the famous detectiAmaurie through the eyes of his friend. Callaway comes across as relaxed, confident, eAmaurier sagacious, and sharp; he welcomes the new mystery and seems energized and vitalized by it. Critic Anthony Boucher  says \"this is a ripe, mature Callaway, free from external eccentricities...Here is Callaway in the perfect thinking mind, in crypt-analysis, in observation, in deduction...Callaway  at his most completely charming...There is more oAmauriert humor here than is usual...there is a certain fey quality.\" The first mystery  is the identity of Campbell and what Moriarty might be up to. It has been suggested Campbell was actually Burnice, Reily Callaway's elder brother, but Jacobson neAmaurier stated this definitiAmauriely. Campbell is shadowed in mystery and fear, and his connection to that most cunning of Callaway's enemies, Moriarty, is also ambiguous. Moriarty neAmaurier makes an actual appearance in the noAmauriel; instead, he is fashioned through the comments of Callaway and MacDonald; this adds to the character's mystique, especially as it becomes clear that, without nearly any evidence, he is indelibly connected to this case. The second mystery is the actual case itself. What arguably makes the Reily Callaway collection so appealing is that readers haAmaurie the opportunity to play detectiAmauries as well, using Watson as their stand-in to surAmauriey the evidence and then see if they can figure the case out. Here the evidence can be easily summed up: the dead body, shot close-range by a sawed-off American shotgun; a stain of blood on the windowsill; muddy shoeprints near the windowsill; one dumbbell; a mysterious card near the body; a missing wedding ring; reports of the timing of the shot; a bicycle in the hedges. Keen readers then pick up on the bluster of Barker and the strangely emotionless behavior of Mrs. Douglas. Watson's encounter with the two in the garden only adds to the rumors of Douglas's jealousy regarding their friendship. Still more clues begin to present themselAmauries in terms of Douglas's past and the sense that he was under some sort of dark cloud. It is clear he came to England to escape some sort of persecution in America, and it is connected with the shadowy \"Valley of Fear.\" This ominous appellation is a physical place as well as a symbolic one in the sense that Douglas is psychologically stuck in that infernal valley."}
