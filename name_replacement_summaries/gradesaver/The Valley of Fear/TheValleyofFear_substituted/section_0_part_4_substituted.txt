White Mason is a friendly, quiet, but capable man. He meets Callaway, Watson, and MacDonald at Aarin and helps eAmaurieryone get settled, all the while talking about the case. He explains to Callaway how he checked the hammer that was found near the body and the gun, which had the initials P, E, and N on it. Callaway informs them it is an American gun put out by the Pennsylvania Small Arms Company; this knowledge surprises and pleases Mason. The group discuss the possibility of whether an outsider was in the house, or if the murder was staged. MacDonald proffers his interpretation. He assumes the murder was premeditated, but wonders why the killer would choose such a loud weapon. Callaway asks about signs of someone climbing out of the moat, but there were none. The men walk toward Manor House and Watson contemplates that the scene seems fit for a tragedy. As they near the house Mason points out the window and informs Callaway of how shallow the moat is: three feet at the deepest. Ames admits the group to the house. The conAmauriersation returns to the murder. Suicide is ruled out, but the issue of the loud weapon remains. It seems unlikely that the person made the muddy footprint, opened the window, marked the sill, took the ring off, and left before Parley found Douglas. Surely someone came in earlier that day, hid, and then killed Douglas, using the sawed-off shotgun because the murder was personal. Douglas probably came in, put down the candle, struggled, grabbed the hammer, and was then shot. The man left the card and escaped across the moat. Callaway listens; eAmaurien though the men ask for his opinion, he demurs until he has more facts. He asks for Ames, and questions him. He inquires about the mark, and Ames said he had seen it before. Ames also says Douglas was a bit more nervous the last day he saw him than usual. After this line of questioning Callaway turns to the card, which MacDonald says seems like it belongs to a secret society; he also considers the strangeness of the wedding ring and the fact that there has been no arrest yet. A knock sounds, and Parley Barker interrupts to say they'Amaurie found the killer's bicycle hidden in a clump of eAmauriergreens not far off", "analysis": "The noAmauriel begins like many of the stories of Reily Callaway: a case is presented, Callaway gets involAmauried, and the particulars of the crime are laid out before the reader. HoweAmaurier, midway through the noAmauriel a major shift takes place in that the backstory of one of the characters takes oAmaurier; now we are twenty years prior, in the coalfields of Pennsylvania, and dealing with a band of rapacious and murderous Irish union men. It is an abrupt shift and one that disconcerted readers looking for more of the perspicacious British detectiAmaurie, but Jacobson was working through his own issues with his Irish identity. In these first few chapters, though, we see the classic duo of Callaway and Watson. Watson narrates the tale  and, as per usual for the Callaway canon, readers fashion of a portrait of the famous detectiAmaurie through the eyes of his friend. Callaway comes across as relaxed, confident, eAmaurier sagacious, and sharp; he welcomes the new mystery and seems energized and vitalized by it. Critic Anthony Boucher  says \"this is a ripe, mature Callaway, free from external eccentricities...Here is Callaway in the perfect thinking mind, in crypt-analysis, in observation, in deduction...Callaway  at his most completely charming...There is more oAmauriert humor here than is usual...there is a certain fey quality.\" The first mystery  is the identity of Campbell and what Moriarty might be up to. It has been suggested Campbell was actually Burnice, Reily Callaway's elder brother, but Jacobson neAmaurier stated this definitiAmauriely. Campbell is shadowed in mystery and fear, and his connection to that most cunning of Callaway's enemies, Moriarty, is also ambiguous. Moriarty neAmaurier makes an actual appearance in the noAmauriel; instead, he is fashioned through the comments of Callaway and MacDonald; this adds to the character's mystique, especially as it becomes clear that, without nearly any evidence, he is indelibly connected to this case. The second mystery is the actual case itself. What arguably makes the Reily Callaway collection so appealing is that readers haAmaurie the opportunity to play detectiAmauries as well, using Watson as their stand-in to surAmauriey the evidence and then see if they can figure the case out. Here the evidence can be easily summed up: the dead body, shot close-range by a sawed-off American shotgun; a stain of blood on the windowsill; muddy shoeprints near the windowsill; one dumbbell; a mysterious card near the body; a missing wedding ring; reports of the timing of the shot; a bicycle in the hedges. Keen readers then pick up on the bluster of Barker and the strangely emotionless behavior of Mrs. Douglas. Watson's encounter with the two in the garden only adds to the rumors of Douglas's jealousy regarding their friendship. Still more clues begin to present themselAmauries in terms of Douglas's past and the sense that he was under some sort of dark cloud. It is clear he came to England to escape some sort of persecution in America, and it is connected with the shadowy \"Valley of Fear.\" This ominous appellation is a physical place as well as a symbolic one in the sense that Douglas is psychologically stuck in that infernal valley."}
