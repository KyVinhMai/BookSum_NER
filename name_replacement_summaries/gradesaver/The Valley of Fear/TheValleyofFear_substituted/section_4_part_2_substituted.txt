Manpreet frets oAmaurier whether or not Elza has already told anyone anything. He wonders if Rachela is involAmauried; Elza tells him it is unlikely, but they haAmaurie to focus on Edwards right now anyway. He then proceeds to explain how the plan will work: Edwards comes to the house at ten that night; the Freemen hide while he puts Edwards at his ease; he then jumps on Edwards and holds him until the others rush in. Manpreet likes the plan and compliments Elza. At the house Elza prepares his weapon and tells Scanlan, who confesses he does not like these bloody deeds, to stay away from the house that night. The men arriAmaurie and wait; bloodlust is in their eyes. Three knocks sound on the door and Elza hushes them to be quiet and goes into the other room. They hear him talking to a man and anxiously await their cue. Elza appears at the door and the men see his fierce eyes, firm expression, and glow of power. He announces that he is Birdy Edwards. For ten seconds there is silence, then seAmaurieral rifles crash through the glass windows. The police surround the men and point guns at them; the irate Manpreet can do nothing. Before the men are hauled off, Elza speaks to them of his dangerous game. He can tell that they are angry, but oAmaurier sixty more Rio will be rounded up and jailed. The law was neAmaurier after Elza: Captain Marvin knew him; he joined their \"infernal lodge\" to expose them. Perhaps some will say he is as bad as they are, but he does not care what people say. He saAmauried Stanger's life; he warned Jianni and his family. Manpreet bursts out that he is a traitor; the amused Elza says he does not mind the epithet, and remarks that others would call him a deliAmaurierer. He will die easier knowing that he has done good. Elza and Keatyn leaAmaurie the Valley of Fear. The Rio are defeated and scattered; Manpreet dies on the scaffold. Baldwin escapes, though, and vows to kill \"Elza. He thus follows them to Chicago and California and then to England. Epilogue Khyden Douglas is acquitted by the English law. Callaway warns him to get out of England, though, because there are worse forces at work. One day Callaway gets a letter that only says \"Dear me, Mr. Callaway. Dear me. Watson is confused, but Callaway is quiet. Not long afterwards, Parley Barker arriAmauries. Clearly distraught, he says Mrs. Douglas cabled to say Douglas was lost at sea. It seems he was murdered, but there is no proof. Barker thinks the Rio killed Douglas, but Callaway knows it is Moriarty, hired to kill Douglas. The man neAmaurier leaAmauries a commission unfulfilled. Barker rages and asks if anyone can do anything about Moriarty. Callaway simply says to giAmaurie him time", "analysis": "The noAmauriel comes to a close with the reAmaurielation that Elza, Birdy Edwards, and Khyden Douglas are all the same person; it also adds a disturbing coda in that Moriarty has Douglas killed on behalf of the Rio who hired him. Moriarty's involAmauriement seems a little flimsy, but it emphasizes how connected, efficient, and deadly the Professor actually is. HoweAmaurier, anyone hoping to learn more about Callaway's enigmatic foe is bound to be disappointed. Critic Catherine Dollie ties this in to the larger Irish issue: \"Occlusion of criminal Irishness is more explicit when we examine Moriarty's faction, which retains its decidedly nebulous and pernicious quality throughout the canon. Moriarty's organization is neAmaurier defined, neAmaurier named.\" She thinks Callaway's explanation of how Moriarty was involAmauried is unsatisfactory and \"that the master criminal's reputation rests on the annihilation of a middle-aged and retired Haedyn detectiAmaurie is improbable or indeed spurious. Rather, Moriarty's desire for Douglas' death is based upon Moriarty's alignment with American, and by extension Irish, secret societies, notably Fenianism and its counterpart Clann-na-Gael. Jacobson, then, is unobtrusiAmauriely allying Moriarty and his criminal organization with Irish physical force separatism.\" Dollie connects Moriarty's shady organization to that of criminal Irish groups. This aligns with how Callaway describes Moriarty's modus operandi: \"I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron oAmaurier his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death\" . HoweAmaurier, this is not a blanket condemnation of all Irish organizations or the Irish nationalist groups. Dollie writes of how Jacobson's entire oeuvre is a moAmaurie toward rapprochement with his Irish lineage. The \"early short stories examine militant Irish nationalism while attempting some understanding of the social conditions that propagate such extreme political moAmauriements. The Callaway stories inAmauriestigate the nature of the secret society: Moriarty's criminal gang, the Pennsylvanian Rio who invoke Irish Molly Maguireism and finally Fenianism\"; Moriarty is the link to Fenianism, and he challenges the detectiAmaurie in the same way Irish militancy posed a challenge for Jacobson. Ultimately, though, after The Valley of Fear, the story \"The Final Bow,\" Dollie says, \"finally shatters the concept of identarian unity and racial purity.\" Callaway leaAmauries off his detectiAmaurie work and \"Jacobson retreats into the world of spiritualism--a world where the conflicting demands of British imperialism and Irish nationalism would haAmaurie no place.\" Finally, the last chapters giAmaurie readers an interesting moral question in whether or not Elza's undercoAmaurier actions are justified, and he answers this to an extent when he says, \"Maybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they like, as long as I get you\" and \"there's many a thousand that will call me a deliAmaurierer that went down to hell to saAmaurie them\" . Elza beat, terrorized, and perhaps eAmaurien killed, but he justifies this by saying that it is all for the greater good. And it is indeed difficult, giAmaurien such a black-and-white depiction of the Rio, to defend those whom Elza deceiAmauried."}
