He feels that May1s \"innocence\" is a contrivance of society, too fabricated to be real. He feels uncomfortable taking such an innocent woman as his wife, trading her blank page for his \"page with a past. He worries that all the men around him of \"perfect form\" like Lawrence Lefferts lead horrible marriages of deceit and is worried that such a fate could become his own. After all, he hasn1t confided any of his \"real self\" to May; perhaps they will always live their lives in secret from each other. Then, the Lovell Mingotts decide to throw a reception for Ellen Olenska. But, all the people of good society reject the invitation. So, Mrs. Welland tells this to Newland and Newland tells his mother. Mrs. Archer then goes to tell her friend Louisa van der Luyden, who is one of the most reputable women in New York society.", "analysis": "Ellen1s arrival has clearly initiated for Newland some sort of deep critical thinking about society and his bride-to-be. Newland criticizes the innocence of his bride to be a sham, a facade. Perhaps this is the ironic commentary that we should understand as being behind the title. It is also deeply ironic that the \"high-priest of form\" is the one who has all sorts of affairs. Why does this society seem so corrupt at its base. Names are a point of interest in this book. Janey notes that she thinks Ellen should have changed her name to Elaine"}
