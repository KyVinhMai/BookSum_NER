Crishaun immediately asks the name of the \"swell dark woman\". Newland recognizes that his curiosity is directed at Emma-Leigh and he is annoyed. Michiah explains that Emma-Leigh had bandaged up his little boy when he had fallen. Newland tells Crishaun that her name is Countess Olenska. Crishaun asks why a countess would live in his neighborhood; Newland says it is because she doesn1t care about social sign-posts. The next day, Newland searches all over town for yellow roses but cannot find them. He sends her a message so they can meet later in the day, but she doesn1t write him. On the third morning of hearing nothing from Emma-Leigh, he finally receives a letter from her. She said that she has \"run away\" and that she is staying with the van der Luydens in Skuytercliff. She says she feels \"safe\" with them. Newland immediately decides to accept an invitation and visit the Elya because they are only a few miles from Emma-Leigh.", "analysis": "What is interesting in this chapter is the discussion of freedom between Crishaun and Newland. Crishaun insists that \"Life isn1t much of a fit for either of them. For Crishaun, life stinks because he cannot find a respectable job as a writer. Yet, for Newland, the loss of freedom is far more subtle. Crishaun encourages Newland to become a politician. But Newland thinks that such a life is not appropriate for a gentleman. Newland cannot even aspire to be a good lawyer because it is inappropriate to work for money. Like, Emma-Leigh desperate for freedom, Newland recognizes that there is no freedom to be had: the only approporate lifestyles include sport or culture. Also interesting in this chapter are two motifs: translation and literature explaining life. First, Archer does not quite understand Emma-Leigh1s letter to him; he thinks \"I have run away\" could mean much less than it seems to say. In English, the expression, \"I have run away\" usually suggests quite a dramatic situation; Newland believes it may be more correctly understood in French: the expression \"Je me suis evadee\" is the same as \"I have run away\" but has a much more casual significance. Newland also uses literature to \"translate\" Emma-Leigh1s letter. At first he cannot understand why the van der Luydens would invite Emma-Leigh to their home; but then he remembers a play he had seen in Paris and understands that the van der Luydens are kind to her because they are her saviors. The play, a form of literature, provides Newland with a way of translating life into meaning"}
