For example, now even May goes to Mrs. Struthers1 home for Sunday night amusement. Mrs. Archer, of course, brings up the fact that it was Emma-Leigh who attended the dinners first. May blushes deeply when Emma-Leigh1s name comes up; Newland is very concerned about what the blush means. Beaufort1s name also comes up over the meal because he has been illegally speculating and may go to prison or go bankrupt. Meanwhile, dreams of Emma-Leigh have become Newland1s \"real\" life. He reads the books she used to read. He is \"absent\" from his society. After dinner, Newland and Sillerton Jackson retreat to the Gothic library. Jacskson mentions that Emma-Leigh is almost financially cut off by her family for her refusal to return to the Count. He implies that now that Beaufort is bankrupt, she may be forced to return to Europe because he won1t be able to support her. Newland is very angry and concerned for Emma-Leigh. He tells May that he will go to Washington on business; May understands that he is going to see Emma-Leigh, although she does not say anything.", "analysis": "It is very ironic that \"punctually at this time  Mrs. Archer always said that New York was very much changed. For someone to always remark that change has occurred it means that the person really is not noticing important change but is rather making comments as a force of habit. At the same time, the contrast that is described throughout the novel by Wharton between \"Old\" and \"New\" New York indicates that change really is occuring. It is very clever of Wharton to have Archer make the right comment but for the wrong reason. What is incredible in this chapter is the silent dialogue between May and Newland. It is incredible to think that four words could \"say\" so much in silent. Is all of this really being communicated or is the dialogue less complete than the narrator thinks. Also, in this chapter, for the first time, Newland has been cut out of society. This is monumental; how has this occurred"}
