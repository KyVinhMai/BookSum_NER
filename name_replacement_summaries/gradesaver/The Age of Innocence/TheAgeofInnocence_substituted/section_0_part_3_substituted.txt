{"name": "Chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-5", "summary": "After the Opera, everyone goes to the Beauforts1 home for the annual ball. He keeps a huge room in his house dedicated solely to the annual ball. It sits vacant 364 days in the year. There, May announces to friends that she is engaged. Newland and May dance and, as is appropriate, sit alone in the conservatory where they sneak a kiss while no one is looking. Newland asks if Emma-Leigh has come to the ball; he hopes that she has not come because of her ill reputation. May replies that Emma-Leigh did not feel her dress was pretty enough to attend the ball, so she went home. Newland is glad that May understands propriety so well that she know when not to discuss the \"real\" reason why Emma-Leigh decided not to come: her bad reputation.", "analysis": "In this chapter, it is important to see how reputation is discussed in such depth. The Beaufort1s reputation is discussed; the grandness of their ballroom is discussed. Also, of note, Newland fibs for the first time to May in this chapter; and, his fib concerns Emma-Leigh. Clothing is an important motif in this books. Beaufort1s servants have silk stockings; Emma-Leigh1s clothes are the excuse for why she does not attend the ball. Clothes serve a deep purpose in this novel; it is important to watch each detail of clothing so that we can understand at the end why such emphasis is placed on wardrobe. Another interesting motif is the idea of immortality in the members of New York Society. Mrs. Beaufort, here, is presented as sort of immortal. She \"grows younger and blonder and more beautiful each year. As we continue reading we will find more examples of how people in this society seem to never age, defying death"}
