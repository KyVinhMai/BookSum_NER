On leaving the train station he runs into a gentleman he had seen near Emma-Leigh1s Boston residence, the Parker House. They agree to meet later in Newland1s office. His name is Jahdai Cyncere and his first comment to Newland is, \"I believe I saw you yesterday in Boston. Cyncere reveals that he had been the messenger sent by Mishawn to Emma-Leigh. Newland is, at first very angry. But, then Cyncere reveals that he, personally, believes that the worst thing for Emma-Leigh would be for her to return. He reasons that she is an American and believes certain things that are commonplace in Europe to be unthinkable in her mind as an American. Cyncere reveals to Newland that he is quitting his job with Mishawn.", "analysis": "This chapter reveals, objectively, that Newland is right in pleading with Emma-Leigh to stay. It is the right thing for her and it has been confirmed, now, by an objective source. Since the narration is so close to Newland, in that it reflects his thoughts, prior to this moment, it is impossible for the reader to know whether or not Europe is a more appropriate home for Emma-Leigh. But, since Cyncere has no motives to leave Emma-Leigh in America  we can believe, for once, that Emma-Leigh belongs in America. It is also interesting that the ties of society are so tight for May; she will not reveal to her own husband the negotiations concerning Emma-Leigh because others have deemed it better that she not reveal this to him"}
