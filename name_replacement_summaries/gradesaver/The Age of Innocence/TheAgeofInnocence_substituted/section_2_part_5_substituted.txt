She has gone to church so he takes a cutter to find her. He sees her on the path from the church. They play in the snow and then go to the small Patroon house so they can talk privately. They had only spoken a few moments when she indicates that she is running away from Beaufort; suddenly he arrives and there can be no more discussion of the topic. Newland returns to New York, curious about just why she was running away. He drowns himself in great novels for a few days and then Emma-Leigh sends him a message asking him to visit her late and at night. Newland is not sure how to reply; so he leaves for St. Augustine Florida to visit May.", "analysis": "It seems that Emma-Leigh and Newland are playing a little bit of cat and mouse; running away from each other and then meeting again. First Emma-Leigh runs off to the mountains, then Newland runs off to St. Augustine. Emma-Leigh is seen throughout the scene in a red cloak; a sign of revitalization and passion"}
