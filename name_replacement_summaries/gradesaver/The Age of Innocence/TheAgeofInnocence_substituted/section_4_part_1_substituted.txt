He spends August in Newport with all the other wealthy members of his society. Everyone stands around and watches May shoot an arrow like a goddess at a little contest at the summer party. Later, May decides she wants to visit her Granny and takes the reins of the carriage. Catherine tells them that Emma-Leigh is at home but when they call for her the maid says she has already walked toward the sea. Newland is asked to retrieve her but as he approaches her he realizes that he can1t find the power to approach her. He decides that he will watch a boat and see if it passes a rock before Emma-Leigh looks at him. The boat passes the rock and Emma-Leigh has not turned her gaze away from the sea. So, Newland retreats to the house and pretends he could not find her. That night, as May and Newland travel back to the Welland1s home, May comments that perhaps Emma-Leigh would have been happier with her husband. Newland says her comment was cruel, \"Watching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a favorite sport of the angels; but I believe even they don1t think people happier in hell. All night Newland lays awake thinking of Emma-Leigh.", "analysis": "It seems in this chapter that Newland is dead. His life is a dream and the characters lack depth and reality. He is a coward now. He cannot even approach Emma-Leigh. His soul seems dead. Interestingly, May has retained her godly innocence and beauty while married. Wharton remarks that she is still exactly the same; she like van der Luyden does not age and retains her stature as Diana, the goddess of the hunt and chastity. Catherine is again referred to as a god by the pantheon she has painted on her walls; clearly she recognizes her place as a New York society \"god\" if she has such a painting on her ceiling, The scene where Newland walks to the ocean front and then decides to let \"fate\" determine whether he will approach Emma-Leigh is one of the most memorable scenes in the book. It shows how Newland no longer wishes to will actions; he sets arbitrary signposts in fate and then allows random chance to affect his decisions. As further evidence of this change in his character, May takes the reigns while in their carriage she directs the course of their lives"}
