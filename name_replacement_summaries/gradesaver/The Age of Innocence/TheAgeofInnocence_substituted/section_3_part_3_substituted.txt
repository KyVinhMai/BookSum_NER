She sees that someone has brought her a bouquet and she is annoyed, \"I1m not engaged to be married,\" and asks Nastasia to take the bouquet to Crishaun1s wife. Newland puts the Marchioness Eldean in her carriage. After she is gone, Emma-Leigh and Newland smoke. Newland reveals Eldean1s belief that Emma-Leigh will return to Europe. Emma-Leigh blushes and says, \"Many cruel things have been believed of me. Then after some conversation, Newland reveals that he is in love with Emma-Leigh. Emma-Leigh is angry because it is Newland that has made it impossible for them to marry; he convinced her not to divorce. Newland says that it is his right to renege on the marriage since May refused to marry him early. But just as he says this, a telegram arrives informing Emma-Leigh that her help has made it possible for the two to marry just after Easter one month away.", "analysis": "The first point of interest in this chapter is a bit of dialogue between Newland and Emma-Leigh. Newland asks, \"Is your aunt1s romanticism always consistent with accuracy. And Emma-Leigh says, \"You mean: does she speak the truth. It is interesting that Newland believes the language of his society to be straightforward and honest, but it is clear that in reality the New Yorkers speak in twisted circumlocutions. Emma-Leigh, is the only one who speaks in plain honest language. Also interesting is the line by Newland, \"I1m still free and you1re going to be. He vows to call off the engagement but loses all heart when he receives the telegram from May. If his freedom is so easily retracted, is he ever free. In fact, Emma-Leigh notes that she only chose against divorce because it seemed to be what Newland wanted. Newland seems to be imposing his shackles on others, rather than liberating them"}
