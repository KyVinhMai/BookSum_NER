{"name": "Chapter 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-5", "summary": "As is customary for newly engaged people, Newland calls on Mrs. Welland and May and together they go to Mrs. Manson Eldean1s home to ask her blessing for the marriage. Her home \"lacks propriety\" because her drawing room is on the same floor as the bedroom. To Newland1s and May1s relief, Emma-Leigh is not home; she has gone out shopping during the main \"shopping hour\" which lacks propriety as well. Eldean of course gives her blessing and encourages Newland and May to marry soon, \"before the bubble1s off the wine. As May, Newland and Mrs. Welland are leaving, Emma-Leigh returns with Beaufort. Newland apologizes to Emma-Leigh for not having told her of the engagement at the Opera. Emma-Leigh understands that it isn1t proper to reveal such things in crowds. Emma-Leigh asks Archer to come and visit some time, but Newland thinks to himself how inappropriate such a visit would be.", "analysis": "This chapter is a long discourse on propriety. There is a little bit of foreshadowing in that Eldean encourages the two to marry soon  perhaps there is trouble beneath the surface that Eldean recognizes. Also, we see the motif of immortality shine through in the character of Mrs. Catherine Manson Eldean. Catherine is the grand matriarch of New York Society. She is also similar to Mrs. Beaufort in that she never ages. Her face and body are so fat that she seems to have never wrinkled, despite her old age. Her never wrinkling makes it seem that she retains her youth"}
