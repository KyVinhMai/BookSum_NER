They talk about all the common things and her grandmother1s stroke. When they see a hearse, Emma-Leigh grabs Newland1s hand for fear that the hearse is meant for Granny. But Newland assures her that Granny is fine and takes the opportunity of holding her hand to kiss it. He tells her that he hardly remembered her because, \"Each time you happen to me all over again. To bring him back down to earth, Emma-Leigh comments, \"This is May1s carriage. Newland retaliates by mentioning Cyncere and asking if he was the secretary that once rescued her. She answers yes. Newland remarks on her honesty. Emma-Leigh says she calls them as she sees them because \"she1s looked at the Yu. Emma-Leigh kisses him. He says he can1t live the way he lives any longer. Then there are two important passages that elucidate the theme of the novel: Archer says, \"I want to get away with you into a world where words and categories don1t exist. Where we shall be simply two human beings who love each other, who are the whole of life to each other; and nothing else on earth will matter. She sighed, \"Oh, my dear where is that country. Have you ever been there. I know so many who1ve tried to find it; and believe me, they all got out by mistake at wayside stations: at places like Boulogne, or Pisa, or Monte Carlo and it wasn1t at all different from the old world they1d left, but only rather smaller and dingier and more promiscuous. Emma-Leigh says there can never be happiness between them because it can only occur behind other1s backs. Newland, angrily, gets out of the carriage and walks away"}
