{"name": "Chapter 13", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-11-15", "summary": "On a crowded night at the Wallack1s theater, Newland Archer attends a showing of Shaughraun for the love of one scene: two lovers parting in silence. It reminds him of when he left Emma-Leigh the last time they were together: when they had discussed her divorce. On seeing the scene and remembering Emma-Leigh, Newland begins to cry and gets up to leave the theater. As he is walking out, he sees Emma-Leigh; as he catches her eye, Mrs. Beaufort calls Newland over. He sits behind Emma-Leigh and Emma-Leigh whispers, \"Do you think he will send her yellow roses tomorrow. She was alluding to the roses that Newland had sent her. He says, \"I was thinking that too. She says, \"What do you do while May is away. May is on vacation with her family in Florida. Newland is upset by the obviously suggestive question. She tells him that she has decided not to go through with the divorce because of him. Archer leaves the theater reflecting on a letter that May had sent him. In the letter, May pointed out that Newland is the only one in New York that can truly understand Emma-Leigh and that he should take care of her because she is lonely and unhappy.", "analysis": "Here we see that everything that has been left unsaid by Emma-Leigh  may be true. Emma-Leigh may feel the same way about Newland as he feels about her. Her understanding of the roses in the same context that Newland understands the scene of the play is eerie and points to the similarities between these characters. Their un-discussed romance becomes real in this chapter; this is a point of pivot in the novel. There are some more interesting allusions to the mortal/immortal contrast. Mr. van der Luyden is described as a protecting diety; May has a \"gift of divination"}
