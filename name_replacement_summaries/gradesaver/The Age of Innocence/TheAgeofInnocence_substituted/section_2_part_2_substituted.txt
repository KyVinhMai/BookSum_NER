{"name": "Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-11-15", "summary": "Unlike the members of New York Society, Emma-Leigh has no fear of literature. Archer reflects on this fact and the fact that Emma-Leigh has the mysterious ability to \"reverse his values\" as he walks to her home. Newland walks through the snowy night and arrives at Emma-Leigh1s home. Beaufort is there, trying to woo her away from her trip to Skuytercliff. Skuytercliff is the vacation home of the van der Luydens. Emma-Leigh tells Beaufort to leave because she has business with Archer. Newland is there to discuss the divorce. Newland encourages Emma-Leigh not to divorce because there is no way she can prove her innocence from a love affair after she left her husband. For this reason, she will be scandalized by the papers. Emma-Leigh agrees with Newland reluctantly.", "analysis": "Emma-Leigh pleads that she wants to be the same as everyone else; that, and her freedom, are what drive her desire for a divorce. This is ironic because it is Newland1s desire to have a life different than everyone else1s that leaves him dissatisfied with his engagement. It is these opposing needs which draw them together. It is how they fulfill each other"}
