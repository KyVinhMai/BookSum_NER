{"name": "Chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-11-15", "summary": "Newland is a junior lawyer and is asked by one of the senior partners, Mr. Letterblair, to advise Emma-Leigh Olenska in her divorce. Archer reads the papers and decides that Emma-Leigh should not divorce; but when he listens to Mr. Letterblair argue that she should not divorce, he realizes how self-righteous he sounds and believes the best thing would be to talk to Emma-Leigh first before he unilaterally condemns her decision.", "analysis": "Newland disregards propriety to allow for Emma-Leigh1s freedom, or so he believes. There is a lot in this chapter that deals with facades and hidden intentions. The first question that we must ask is, why is Newland chosen to convince Emma-Leigh not to divorce. On first glance, it seems that he is chosen because family members think it is in his best interest to curtail any bad gossip in his fiance1s family. Hence, he should want to keep her from divorcing, out of a selfish desire to make his new marriage successful. However, there is another possible answer  perhaps, members of May1s family have noticed that Newland seems interested in Emma-Leigh and they want to force him to understand the mandates of propriety. So, they place him in the position where either he does the \"right\" thing, makes Emma-Leigh choose not to divorce or does the \"wrong\" thing, encourages Emma-Leigh to divorce so she can be free to remarry anyone. Perhaps society is using this predicament as a litmus test of Newland1s character"}
