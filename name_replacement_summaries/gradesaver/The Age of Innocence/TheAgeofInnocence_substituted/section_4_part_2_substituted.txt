Strangely, Newland decides to go to the Aly1 home with the hope of seeing the place where Emma-Leigh has been living. He goes to the home, expecting it to be deserted, and finds one of the Jayln daughters who reveals to him that she has gone to Boston.", "analysis": "Interestingly, the whole world seems quite gray except for a pink parasol that Newland finds at the Jayln1s home  a symbol of exoticism. He picks it up, believing it to be Emma-Leigh1s. In his mind, anything exotic and brightly colored must be associated with Emma-Leigh. It is very ironic that Newland would feel this way: in the next chapter we see that Emma-Leigh1s umbrella is actually gray. Her exoticness has been subdued in the year and a half that Newland has not seen her; the woman of his imagination is now different than the real Emma-Leigh. Also, on the way to the Jayln1s, Newland walks past a statue of a cupid. It1s an ineffectual cupid: the cupid has no arrows and no quiver. Newland is very similar to the cupid, metaphorically. Both Newland and Michal are \"archers\", and ineffectual ones. Newland, like the broken cupid, is unable to will action"}
