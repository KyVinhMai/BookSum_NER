{"name": "Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-5", "summary": "Sillerton Jackson comes to dine with the Archers. Janey and Mrs. Archer want to hear the recent gossip on Emma-Leigh Olesnka. They began conversation discussing Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, who apparently was just a model for Mr. Struthers before they married. Then Emma-Leigh was discussed. Jackson said that she had not attended the ball and Mrs. Archer was glad of it. Janey ridicules Emma-Leigh1s dress; Mrs. Archer says that Emma-Leigh was bound to grow up strangely since she was permitted to wear black satin at her coming out ball. Newland defends Emma-Leigh and says that she should be able to act however she pleases since it isn1t her fault that she happened to have married a brute. Later, while the ladies retreat to work on a tapestry for May, the men smoke in the Gothic library. Newland remarks that \"Women ought to be free.", "analysis": "This chapter is significant because Newland1s opinion of Emma-Leigh has changed; he now defends her and her actions; although he still believes in decorum he has taken a stance in his family that Emma-Leigh should not be blamed. What has caused this change of mind. Also, there is some indication of Newland1s \"past\". What happened between him and the Tajae woman. Does he feel, in some ways, similar to Emma-Leigh. Later in the book, Janey is referred to as Cassandra-like. Cassandra is, in Greek mythology, an unfortunate gossip who tells the future although no one believes her. We see Janey1s role as the gossip first manifests here. Freedom is an important theme in this novel. Newland says that women should be free. But one of the central issues in the book is whether or not Newland, himself, is free. If he is not free, then how can he grant freedom. Is Emma-Leigh free. What about May. It is she whom Newland wishes to free the most, and yet, she may turn out to have more freedom than any other character in the novel. In which case, it is deeply ironic that Newland could wish for her freedom in the first place"}
