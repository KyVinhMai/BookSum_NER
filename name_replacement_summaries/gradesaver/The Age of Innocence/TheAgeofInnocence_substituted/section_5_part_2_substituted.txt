Mrs. Beaufort is seen at the Opera in brand new emeralds, a sign that Beaufort has enough money to keep his wife well jeweled. However, it is later revealed that Beaufort, in fact, could not pay his bills. At the law firm, Newland receives a telegram saying that Mrs. Manson Eldean has had a stroke. Apparently, Mrs. J. Beaufort had approached her the night before asking if the family could stand up for her during her husband1s financial crisis. Catherine replies, no. Mrs. Beaufort says \"But my name, Auntie, is Regina Dallas, \" trying to remind her that prior to her marriage she was a member of one of the most prominent New York families. And Catherine replies, \"It was Beaufort when he covered you with jewels, and it1s got to stay Beaufort now that he1s covered you with shame. Catherine also requests that Emma-Leigh come back from Washington so that she can convince her to return to her husband. May remarks that it will be a pity that Newland will not be able to see her since he will be going to Washington while she is returning. Newland leaves to the telegrapher1s office to send Emma-Leigh the message.", "analysis": "In this chapter we catch another glimpse at the power of names. When Regina requests that she be considered a \"Dallas\" and not a \"Beaufort\", Catherine rejects her claim. It is society that determines which labels a person may take"}
