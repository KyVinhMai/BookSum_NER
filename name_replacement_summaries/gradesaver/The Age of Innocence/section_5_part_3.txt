{"name": "Chapter 28", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-26-30", "summary": "Newland sends off the telegram; he is confronted at the office by Lefferts who wants to of course discuss the rumors. Later, at the Wellands1, there is a crisis over who shall pick Ellen up at the station. Newland volunteers to go. May asks Newland how he will have the time to pick up Ellen and still make it to Washington. Newland lies and says that his business trip has been postponed. May catches him in a lie but has too much propriety to confront him about it. As Newland leaves for the station, May seems to have a tear in her eye.", "analysis": "Now we begin to question, how much does May know. Does she feign ignorance for the sake of propriety. Is she as miserable as Ellen and Newland, just better at pretending. It also interesting in this chapter that Catherine suddenly cares about Ellen. One passage is particularly informative: \"The growing remoteness of old age, though it had not diminished her curiosity about her neighbors, had blunted her never ver likely compassion for their troubles; and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the Beaufort disaster out of her mind. But for the first time she became absorbed in her own symptoms, and began to take a sentimental interest in certain members of her family to who she had hitherto been contemptuously indifferent. This passage indicates that Catherine1s prior \"godly\" coldness and indifference may have changed with the stroke. Her character has undergone a significant transformation as indicated by her desire to bring Ellen home. Also it seems rather arbitrary that a society like this one would tolerate marital infedility but would become so angry over some fiinancial \"infidelity. This whole episode is meant to illustrate how arbitrary some of the codes of New York Society truly are"}
