Archer was struck by something languid and inelastic in May1s attitude, and wondered if the deadly monotony of their lives had laid its weight on her. The two discuss the same commonplace gossip. Newland decides to read some history instead of poetry because he hates listening to the way May analyzes poetry. And May does her embroidery although her big hands are not naturally suited to the work. They aregue over leaving the window open and then go to bed. Seven days later Mrs. Manson Mingott invites Newland, just Newland, to her home. There, she half-jokingly accuses Newland of having made advances toward Ellen isn1t this why she threw him out of the carriage. Then, surprisingly, Catherine informs Newland that she1s going to keep Ellen in New York to take care of her and that she needs Newland1s support to convince the family that she should not be sent back to Europe. Newland agrees.", "analysis": "The bedroom scene is very interesting because it shows that nether Newland, nor, more surprisingly May, are being the people they were naturally designed to be. Newland reads history, although her prefers poetry, and May embroiders, although her hands are too big. In this chapter we can see that Catherine has, in a sense, fallen from immortality. She has her first signs of aging, dark shadows between the fold of her flesh. She for the first time, shows evident compassion and caring for Ellen, one of the \"mortals\". Also, in this chapter, Catherine refers to Ellen as a \"sweet bird. In fact, throughout the book, Ellen has been described with feathers. Right before Newland goes to fetch Ellen from her train he examines a picture of cardinals. And later, when Newland seeks freedom, he needs air, just as birds need air for flight. This is a common motif throughout the book"}
