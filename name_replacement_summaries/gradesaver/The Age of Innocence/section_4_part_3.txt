He sees her sitting on a bench outside of the building. He says hello and for the first time, he sees a startled look on her face. Previously, the narrator has told us that Ellen never seems to become surprised. She is on a bench thinking if she should return to her husband. He has sent a messenger to bring her back and he is offering a big sum of money. Newland stares at her and says, \"Haven1t we done all we could. They take a boat ride together and then have dinner in a private dining hall; they do not touch and barely speak to each other. The silence and isolation is simply enough.", "analysis": "This is the first chapter where Newland finally seems alive again. This scene is desperate, beautiful and simple. Many scenes in the novel are described as tableau they are described like still-life oil paintings. One of the most important tableau is the scene where Newland approaches Ellen. He sees her sitting across the Common and the narrator describes his vision as if she were a beautiful painting. The Scorcese film actually depicts this scene with a real oil painting. Also, it is very ironic that Newland feels as if their little boat trip is \"like they were starting on some long voyave from which they might never return. In reality, their trip is nothing like a long voyage. It is just a circular trip through Boston Harbor"}
