Archer reflects on this fact and the fact that Ellen has the mysterious ability to \"reverse his values\" as he walks to her home. Newland walks through the snowy night and arrives at Ellen1s home. Beaufort is there, trying to woo her away from her trip to Skuytercliff. Skuytercliff is the vacation home of the van der Luydens. Ellen tells Beaufort to leave because she has business with Archer. Newland is there to discuss the divorce. Newland encourages Ellen not to divorce because there is no way she can prove her innocence from a love affair after she left her husband. For this reason, she will be scandalized by the papers. Ellen agrees with Newland reluctantly.", "analysis": "Ellen pleads that she wants to be the same as everyone else; that, and her freedom, are what drive her desire for a divorce. This is ironic because it is Newland1s desire to have a life different than everyone else1s that leaves him dissatisfied with his engagement. It is these opposing needs which draw them together. It is how they fulfill each other"}
