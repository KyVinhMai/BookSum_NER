Strangely, Newland decides to go to the Blenkers1 home with the hope of seeing the place where Ellen has been living. He goes to the home, expecting it to be deserted, and finds one of the Blenker daughters who reveals to him that she has gone to Boston.", "analysis": "Interestingly, the whole world seems quite gray except for a pink parasol that Newland finds at the Blenker1s home  a symbol of exoticism. He picks it up, believing it to be Ellen1s. In his mind, anything exotic and brightly colored must be associated with Ellen. It is very ironic that Newland would feel this way: in the next chapter we see that Ellen1s umbrella is actually gray. Her exoticness has been subdued in the year and a half that Newland has not seen her; the woman of his imagination is now different than the real Ellen. Also, on the way to the Blenker1s, Newland walks past a statue of a cupid. It1s an ineffectual cupid: the cupid has no arrows and no quiver. Newland is very similar to the cupid, metaphorically. Both Newland and Cupid are \"archers\", and ineffectual ones. Newland, like the broken cupid, is unable to will action"}
