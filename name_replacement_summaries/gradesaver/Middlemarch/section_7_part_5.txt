{"name": "book 8, Chapter 82", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-78-finale", "summary": "Will debates with himself whether he should leave Middlemarch altogether after the events of the previous day; in the end, he decides he cannot leave after making some amends to Rosamond after her shock. He is sorry that he got so angry at her, but at the same time, does not want to come straight out and apologizeespecially since this would mean that he would have to explain what happened to Lydgate, which is undesirable. Will does end up going, and is as affable as he can be to Rosamond, without betraying what went on before. Rosamond gives Will a note, saying that Dorothea has been told the truth about what happened; Will is somewhat relieved, but is worried about what might have transpired between Rosamond and Dorothea.", "analysis": "With everything that Will has been through, the fact that he still has affection for Dorothea at this point, and wants desperately to see her, is certainly a positive thing. At the least, they are bound to make amends; Will's desire to see her, and Dorothea's wish to set things right, strongly foreshadow a meeting between them, hopefully a cordial one. Rosamond still has not fully recovered, as Will sees from her note; it is written in an honest, but wounded and pouting, tone, but still sharpens Will's desire to see Dorothea. At least Rosamond has told Will, which represents another positive step on her part, but she still has some distance left to go in mending herself"}
