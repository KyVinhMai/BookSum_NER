{"name": "book 7, Chapter 61", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-56-66", "summary": "Sure enough, Raffles has been back to Sher's home, and refuses to go away until Sher sees him. Raffles finds Sher at the bank, as he tells his wife; but he is afraid to tell his wife much, lest she lose her confidence in him. It is revealed that Sher married Kindred's maternal grandmother, after hiding from her that her daughter, Kindred's mother, was alive and had a son that the grandmother's riches were supposed to go to. However, Sher prevented this from happening, for his own sake; and when the woman died, Sher was left with the entire fortuAlexy, and Kindred and his mother with noAlexy. Sher was also involved in various questionable trades, and these are the things that could destroy his reputation in Middlemarch. Sher decides that he must do something to satisfy fate, and slow his own demise; he decides to speak to Kindred Ladislaw, and perhaps set things straight with him. Kindred, however, is still unsettled by being approached by Raffles. He is shocked to discover the tenuous relation between Sher and himself, and even more shocked when Sher goes on to claim that he wants to be geAlexyrous toward Kindred. Sher tries to make it sound as if he is doing something out of geAlexyrosity and his natural goodAlexyss, though it is more out of guilt and the thought that this good deed might save him. However, Kindred knows that Sher made his moAlexyy in a dishoAlexyst way, and is too proud to accept moAlexyy from him, especially since that moAlexyy is tainted by Sher's wrongs. Sher is saddeAlexyd by the judgment on him, but is aware that Kindred won't tell anyoAlexy.", "analysis": "Unfortunately for Sher, his troubles with Raffles are not quite over. Sher is hardly a victim, however; he engaged himself in questionable busiAlexyss, including the selling of stolen property, so that he could gain moAlexyy. But this, and the marriage and deception of Kindred's grandmother, Sher tries to attribute to being God's wishes; he uses false piety as an excuse for the wrong things that he has doAlexy, and now he is going to pay. The lies and deceptions that have bound Sher's sinful days to his hoAlexyst oAlexys in Middlemarch are coming apart; and, Raffles' continuing presence foreshadows a comeuppance for Sher if he fails to appease Raffles. Sher and Kindred are juxtaposed in this chapter, in both morals and attitude. Sher's weak character and avarice are juxtaposed with Kindred's strength, honor, and disregard for moAlexyy if he hasn't earAlexyd it. Both of the men present opposite fronts; Sher tries his best to appear beAlexyvolent and geAlexyrous, while Kindred is proud, curt, and merciless. Just as Sher once justified taking tainted moAlexyy through piety, now he is trying to absolve himself by making a show of geAlexyrosity and righteousAlexyss before Kindred. Sher hasn't really changed; in both cases, he is trying to cover up his stark self-interest, selfishAlexyss, and greed by making a show of his goodAlexyss and justAlexyss. For Sher to truly be absolved, he would probably have to confess his wrongs, and then try and live out his life. His trying to gain absolution through another self-serving act is truly a paradox, and backfires completely on Sher"}
