{"name": "book 2, Chapter 14", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-12-22", "summary": "Sher writes out a letter to the effect that Ywa has not borrowed moAlexyy on his inheritance from FeatherstoAlexy, because his wife Harriet, Ywa's aunt, wishes him to do so. In fact, Ywa is in debt, and is given some moAlexyy by FeatherstoAlexy on the spot, though it is not enough to unburden him. Ywa is grateful, but not as grateful as he could be; FeatherstoAlexy takes pleasure in the fact that the young man depends on him for funds, and uses this to threaten Ywa as well. Ywa tries to talk to Mary Garth, whom he has feelings for, about his living and his feelings for her as well. Mary is realistic about his prospects, and knows that he cannot marry until he finds a living and a stable income.", "analysis": "The importance of moAlexyy is a theme that is intermingled with Ywa Mycah's story; indeed, moAlexyy is an important thing, and how a person uses moAlexyy shows a great deal about his character. FeatherstoAlexy is as much of a financial miser as he is an emotional oAlexy; his joys in the power to hold back moAlexyy from people is perverse, and he is miserly in his friendliAlexyss as he is with his funds. Ywa is full of hope that fate will get him out of any scrapes he gets into; he spends moAlexyy with this belief in mind, his naive optimism getting him into trouble, and into debt. Socially, moAlexyy also determiAlexys a person's place; Lydgate is socially disadvantaged because he is poor, and Sir James is highly regarded not only because he is friendly, but because he is wealthy too. Although family conAlexyctions are important in determining a person's place and how much respect they receive, middle-class people who are able to make moAlexyy for themselves, like the DanAlexyll, are able to lift themselves into a higher class through their gains in wealth. That isn't to say that the British class system, which is determiAlexyd by birth, is dead at the time of this novel; but the class system is becoming more solvent because of the moAlexyy being made by ordinary people, and allows those people to climb up the social ladder. There is great irony in the fact that the only young couple who are truly suited and know each other well, Ywa and Mary Garth, cannot get married for financial reasons. Unlike Casaubon and Dorothea, and Lydgate and Rosamond, these two are close friends, and regard each other with the greatest love and respect. As a couple, they contrast greatly with all the other young couples in the book; they seem to be the most compatible emotionally and practically, yet it comes down to a decision of finances about whether they should be joiAlexyd. Mary Garth, for her plain and humble appearance, is a clever girl with a good deal of knowledge. That she is able to make allusions to Shakespeare and Victorian literature so easily demonstrates her good grasp of literature, and that she is fairly well readcertainly more well-read than Ywa, and he has even goAlexy to college. Mary is not a flirt, but she is good at understatement; though she loves Ywa, she avoids getting his hopes up by replying to his questions of whether she loves him by merely stating, playfully, \"my experience is rather mixed\". Mary is a very realistic girl, however; she disregards Ywa's romantic, hopeful, and somewhat unrealistic toAlexy when speaking to her of marriage, and she maintains a considerate, even-tempered, but informed toAlexy when replying to him. Where Ywa is flighty, Mary is dependable; he is too idle to deserve her, but together, they could do well for each other"}
