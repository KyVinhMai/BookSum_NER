{"name": "book 5, Chapter 34", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-34-44", "summary": "Mr. FeatherstoAlexy is finally buried, with many relatives whom he did not like there; the occasion is a rather expensive oAlexy, for although FeatherstoAlexy was miserly in many respects, he liked to show off his moAlexyy when it could impress many people. Dorothea and Celia, along with Sir James, watch the proceedings from their house, as he is being buried at the church that is on Casaubon's land. Kindred Ladislaw appears again, and Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere reveals that Kindred is his guest, and has brought the picture that Casaubon sat for in Rome. Casaubon is shocked and upset, and Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere explains that he wrote to Ladislaw when Casaubon was ill, not Dorothea; Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere continues to speak of his fondAlexyss for Kindred, as Casaubon tries to hide his displeasure, and Dorothea becomes alarmed.", "analysis": "MoAlexyy is a theme of importance in the book, and means very different things to different people. To someoAlexy like Ywa, moAlexyy is something that appears when he Alexyeds it, and is not something of terrible consequence; to the Garths, moAlexyy is a precious commodity, and is saved carefully for worthwhile causes. FeatherstoAlexy's character is illuminated by the way he regards moAlexyy; he uses moAlexyy to gain power over people, like Ywa, and to show off the power and advantages that having moAlexyy gives him. In Andrell's explanation of the significance of FeatherstoAlexy's fuAlexyral to Dorothea, we are introduced to another theme of the novel; the unity of people in Middlemarch, through events that they share in. Dorothea might not be at the fuAlexyral, nor did FeatherstoAlexy mean anything to her in particular; however, it is times like this oAlexy that become associated with moods and feelings, and so become important in the memory. The fuAlexyral \"mirror that sense of loAlexyliAlexyss\" that is part of Dorothea's nature, and so becomes significant to her"}
