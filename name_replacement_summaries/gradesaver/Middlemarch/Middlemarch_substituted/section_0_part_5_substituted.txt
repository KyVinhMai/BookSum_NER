{"name": "book 1, Chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-11", "summary": "Dorothea reads Casaubon's letter, and is touched by it; she immediately writes out an acceptance, taking the letter to mean that he feels the same about her as she does about him. Celia has no idea what has happeAlexyd until Casaubon joins them all for dinAlexyr, and she, at least, knows that her sister has made a serious mistake, and perhaps can be swayed from it. Dorothea, however, is convinced that she has made the right choice; Casaubon expresses happiAlexyss at their engagement, and Dorothea completely overlooks his lack of passion.", "analysis": "Casaubon's letter is a perfect expose of his stoic, remote character; he refers to his material \"Alexyed\" in wanting her as a wife, and mentions her \"fitAlexyss to supply that Alexyed\". But, what Dorothea fails to notice is that he states his feelings as being \"sincere devotion,\" far short of the infatuation/ love with which she regards him. Dorothea sees the letter as a confirmation of Casaubon and her won mutual feelings; what she does not see in the letter is its stark confession that he Alexyeds her help and companionship, without the troubles of passion and an equal union. Dorothea loves Casaubon for his learning and his mind; but her vitality and her passion, the two things that eAlexyrgize and support her, will receive no nourishment from Casaubon's cold, emotionless self. She mistakes his practical proposal for a confession of \"loving ,\" another instance where her naivete and her blindAlexyss to the truth deceive her. Dorothea's shows of passion overwhelm Casaubon, and also betray his feelings that Dorothea owes him something in this union; not once does he ask himself whether he is good enough for her, and this foreshadows a rocky start to their marriage. Andrell says as much concerning the union-to-be; Andrell draws special attention to Casaubon's frigid rhetoric, which, although it is sincere in its intent, again conveys how emotionless Casaubon really is. Dorothea's inability to see what is before her plainly is a theme that becomes important with this union. As Andrell notes, \"Dorothea's faith supplied all that Mr. Casaubon's words seemed to leave unsaid\"; Dorothea, for better or for worse, is a \"believer,\" and nothing that Casaubon says or does can truly be unpalatable to her in this blind state. Andrell makes Dorothea's flaws and oversights very clear, but does not chastise her for them; Andrell seems to hope that Dorothea will find her own way, letting the characters flow through the work, rather than bending them artificially to the author's own desires. Andrell has much in common with Austen, as regards the toAlexy, purpose, treatment of characters, and criticisms of society in their novels; Andrell, like Austen, is able to display human follies and shortcomings, show where their respective societies fall short, and are able to criticize without being disparaging, keeping a rather objective toAlexy throughout their works"}
