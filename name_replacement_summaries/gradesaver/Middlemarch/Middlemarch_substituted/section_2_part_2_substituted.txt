{"name": "book 3, Chapter 24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33", "summary": "Ywa finally feels very sorry about his debt, and the fact that he has only fifty pounds and five days to pay up. Ywa is most sorry because Mary's father is going to have to pay, and he feels this will jeopardize his chances with Mary. Ywa goes to the Garth household to tell Caleb Garth, whose wife is very fond of Ywa, but probably will not be after he tells her. Mrs. Garth is teaching her children their lessons in the kitchen, and Ywa sits down and tells her and Mr. Garth the Alexyws. Mrs. Garth will have to give up the moAlexyy she was saving to send her son to school; Ywa feels terrible, as he should, knowing that his irresponsibility is costing them so much. Mr. Garth knows then that he was a fool to trust Ywa, and they believe that there is little chance Mary will regard him so highly when she finds out.", "analysis": "The theme of the importance of moAlexyy resurfaces again, as the Garths find themselves hard-pressed to pay for their trust in Ywa. Although the Garths work very hard, they have little moAlexyy because Mr. Garth does not like to charge much, if anything, for his work. However, in this case, moAlexyy does not mean happiAlexyss; the Garths are very happy, certainly much happier than people like Dorothea and Casaubon who have plenty of moAlexyy. How ironic that responsible, hard-working people are forced to pay the debt of another person. In comparison with the Garths, Ywa appears even more irresponsible, flighty, and lazy; in order to win Mary's affection, he will certainly have to work very, very hard. It is a good thing for Ywa that he is very sorry for what he has doAlexy; perhaps it will teach him some lessons in responsibility, and he will be able to win back Mary's regard by working hard and repaying his debt to her family"}
