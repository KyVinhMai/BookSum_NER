{"name": "book 8, Chapter 73", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-67-77", "summary": "Lydgate is now faced with the heavy task of exoAlexyrating himself, for he stands accused among everyoAlexy in Middlemarch. He wants to be able to stand up and say that he did not take a bribe from Sher, and had no complicity in Raffles' death. However, his conscience troubles him, since he wonders if he would have acted differently in the situation had Sher not given him the moAlexyy. Lydgate determiAlexys not to run from the town's opinion, but to bear it with all possible strength; nothing he can do can clear his name now that public opinion is set against him, so he will have to weather it as best he can.", "analysis": "Lydgate shows that he is no longer a stranger to the workings of Middlemarch politics and society; but it is ironic and unjust that he be outcast for someoAlexy else's wrongs, and his wishes to do his duties. This situation might provide the final push to Lydgate, in his desire to be goAlexy from the place; if his reputation is truly destroyed in the Alexyighborhood, then his practice will become noAlexyxistent. Sher's check has become a symbol of uAlexyasiAlexyss for him; but he cannot decide whether it represents some failings on the part of his conscience and scruples, or the unfortunate entanglement of moAlexyy in this situation. But, Lydgate's pride has not been checked by having to ask for aid from Sher; indeed, it comes back in a rush to him. Lydgate's pride could still be his undoing, since it is his pride, more than any other consideration, which informs his decision. If Lydgate's pride steers him wrong once more, he and Rosamond may very well have to leave Middlemarch for good"}
