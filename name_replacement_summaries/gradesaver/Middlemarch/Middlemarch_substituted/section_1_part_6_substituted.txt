{"name": "book 2, Chapter 17", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-12-22", "summary": "Lydgate goes to see Farebrother at home, and observes his domestic situation. Farebrother's mother engages Lydgate in a debate about changes in religion, which Farebrother and Lydgate seem to espouse. Farebrother is a man of science, like Lydgate; they get along well, which makes Lydgate question Sher's championing of Mr. Adama even more. However, Farebrother is knowledgeable about Middlemarch politics, and knows that Lydgate must vote with Sher if he wants to get ahead; Lydgate listens to this advice, but wants to vote with his conscience instead.", "analysis": "There are quite a few parallels in the lives and personalities of Lydgate and Farebrother. Both are men of scientific minds, with a great amount of interest in natural things and natural processes. Neither is in a great financial situation, meaning that marriage is not in the cards; and both are somewhat worldly and progressive-minded, clinging to changes that are being made in their own professions. Farebrother and Lydgate are also of the same opinion of many of the people of Middlemarch; they know that they must humor many people and speak very carefully to all those people who they really regard as idiots. Farebrother is also able to inform Lydgate about a great deal regarding Middlemarch politics, of which Lydgate still has much to learn. Lydgate alludes to Voltaire when explaining his reservations about Sher; but it does not matter what Lydgate's feelings about the man are, it all comes down to whose support he wants. Farebrother describes Sher and his set more correctly; he posits the metaphor that \"mankind a doomed carcase which is to nourish them for heaven,\" and knows that Sher and his ilk can be as unpleasant as they are ignorant. Farebrother shows great geAlexyrosity and hoAlexysty in advising Lydgate to vote with Sher; Farebrother is a truly intelligent and perceptive man, with a good understanding of the way Middlemarch politics work, and of how to keep from getting burAlexyd by them"}
