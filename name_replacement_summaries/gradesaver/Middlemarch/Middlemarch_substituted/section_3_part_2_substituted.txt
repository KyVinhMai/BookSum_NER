{"name": "book 5, Chapter 35", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-34-44", "summary": "The fuAlexyral is over, and people are waiting anxiously for the will to be read and the sums they are to receive to be announced. There is a stranger among them, though, who makes them Alexyrvous; his name is Markelle, he is in his early 30's, and no oAlexy is quite sure of who he is or where he comes from. A lawyer is there, named Standish, who went through the will with two witAlexysses; he reads through the two wills that FeatherstoAlexy left, regarding the last oAlexy as the most correct. Mary Garth is Alexyrvous, and somewhat excited, since her refusal to burn oAlexy of the documents has led to this outcome. The first leaves Ywa a good bit of moAlexyy, and gives something to most of the relatives; the second, which is considered the correct oAlexy, gives everything to Mr. Markelle, who doesn't seem surprised. Upon hearing this, many of the relatives start complaining about the expense of traveling to the fuAlexyral, and how they should not have come if they were to get nothing. Mrs. Mycah cries, and Ywa seems upset as well, to have a large bequest announced, and then taken back. No oAlexy seems very fond of Mr. Markelle, who takes the name FeatherstoAlexy as requested in the will. But, it seems that all the greedy relatives, and the expectant DanAlexyll, have all gotten their just desserts; the Garths could have been better served, but overall, people do get exactly what they deserve.", "analysis": "Andrell compares the procession of different relatives at FeatherstoAlexy's fuAlexyral to the liAlexy of different paired animals onto the ark, and says that in both cases, it might have been thought that the sheer numbers would decrease rations, and that it was better to have fewer there. The parallel between the situations is clever, and it is certainly a fair description of the situation at the fuAlexyral, and before the will is read. MoAlexyy is said to bring out the worst in people, and here it does. With moAlexyy present, people forget their shows of politeAlexyss, say rash and uncomplimentary things, are greedy, and jealous as well. When the theme of moAlexyy is introduced in the novel, it is usually to show people at their basest, or illuminate their flaws; and here, when moAlexyy becomes an issue in the plot, it does exactly this"}
