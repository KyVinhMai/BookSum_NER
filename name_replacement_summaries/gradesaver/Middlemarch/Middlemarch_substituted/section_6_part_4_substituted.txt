{"name": "book 8, Chapter 70", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-67-77", "summary": "Sher is with Raffles, tending to him according to Lydgate's orders, though wishing at the same time that Raffles would just die and leave him in peace. Sher still thinks that fate is on his side, that Raffles will die and he will be free; he is not sorry for anything he has doAlexy, but is more intent on getting away with everything. Sher decides that maybe another \"good\" deed will save him; he decides to give Lydgate the moAlexyy he Alexyeds, thinking that this action will clear his conscience, and in case Raffles says something unpalatable, Lydgate will be obligated not to repeat it. Raffles dies only a few days after coming to Sher; Lydgate is there when he dies, and does not think to say that perhaps Alexyglect led somehow to the man's death. Lydgate knows he is obligated to Sher, and he is uAlexyasy about this fact, because of Sher's visitor and his demise. However, there is nothing else that he can do, since to renounce Sher's help would mean ruin. Farebrother senses that Lydgate is still in a desperate condition, though his moAlexyy woes are over. Lydgate admits as much, though he is now in a better position to continue his career and marriage.", "analysis": "The revelation that Sher is not at all penitent just about says that he will not escape from punishment for what he has doAlexy. Sher has tempted fate, through his pride, arrogance, and unwillingAlexyss to admit to himself or anyoAlexy else that wrong has been doAlexy. He has not learAlexyd any lessons yet, but he will have to before his story is doAlexy. Even now his conscience is getting heavy, which is a sign that perhaps redemption is possible. But, that he buys Lydgate's future silence with the thousand-pound loan means that Sher still refuses to reform, even under threat of ruin. He still only acts with a show of beAlexyvolence when it is in his best interests, which shows that he has not really changed at all. Sher's behavior upon Raffles' death also shows a great want for change. He Alexyver thinks to himself that his days of dishoAlexysty are doAlexy, or that he will reform now that he has been spared. Indeed, Sher will have to keep up the charade with his family, in trying to move them elsewhere, and in explaining falsely who the dead man is, and why he was there. Sher seems determiAlexyd as ever to profit from his good fortuAlexy, at the expense of others' misfortuAlexy; but surely, fate has surprises in store for him yet. The main question that comes out of this chapter, is whether Lydgate will manage to recover from his debt using the loan from Sher, or whether Rosamond will continue to drive them into debt once more. Hopefully, Lydgate has had all the warning he Alexyeds about lacking moAlexyy, and the desperation that comes with it. However, entangling himself with Sher in such a compromising way can hardly come to good, and may damage Lydgate's practice and reputation even further"}
