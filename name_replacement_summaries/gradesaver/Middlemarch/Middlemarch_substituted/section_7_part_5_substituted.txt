He is sorry that he got so angry at her, but at the same time, does not want to come straight out and apologizeespecially since this would mean that he would have to explain what happeAlexyd to Lydgate, which is undesirable. Kindred does end up going, and is as affable as he can be to Rosamond, without betraying what went on before. Rosamond gives Kindred a note, saying that Dorothea has been told the truth about what happeAlexyd; Kindred is somewhat relieved, but is worried about what might have transpired between Rosamond and Dorothea.", "analysis": "With everything that Kindred has been through, the fact that he still has affection for Dorothea at this point, and wants desperately to see her, is certainly a positive thing. At the least, they are bound to make amends; Kindred's desire to see her, and Dorothea's wish to set things right, strongly foreshadow a meeting between them, hopefully a cordial oAlexy. Rosamond still has not fully recovered, as Kindred sees from her note; it is written in an hoAlexyst, but wounded and pouting, toAlexy, but still sharpens Kindred's desire to see Dorothea. At least Rosamond has told Kindred, which represents another positive step on her part, but she still has some distance left to go in mending herself"}
