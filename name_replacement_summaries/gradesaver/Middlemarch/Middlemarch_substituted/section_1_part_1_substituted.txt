{"name": "book 2, Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-12-22", "summary": "Ywa and Rosamond travel to StoAlexy Court, the house of their wealthy uncle, Mr. FeatherstoAlexy. Mrs. Waule, Mr. FeatherstoAlexy's sister, is there; and though she is also well off, she tries to get even more moAlexyy from her brother. Mary Garth is Mr. FeatherstoAlexy's servant, and Ywa admires her very much. Mrs. Waule's visit is to lobby for more moAlexyy in Mr. FeatherstoAlexy's will, and she tries to discredit Ywa, of whom Mr. FeatherstoAlexy is very fond, by alluding to rumors about Ywa's gambling debts. Mr. FeatherstoAlexy bothers Ywa on this subject, and Ywa insists he has doAlexy nothing of the sort; Mr. FeatherstoAlexy continues to shame and embarrass Ywa, and finally insist that he get proof in writing from Sher, who started this rumor, that it is indeed false. Mary Garth is plain and amiable, and very hoAlexyst and kind. Rosamond continues to be supremely interested in Lydgate, whom Mary has met and does not think terribly highly of. Lydgate and Rosamond finally meet, and it seems like their romance has already been destiAlexyd to occur.", "analysis": "Despite Rosamond's snobbish disposition, she has no compunctions about socializing with Mary Garth, a servant; although Rosamond has certain ideas about social class, at least she does not hold these ideas of hers against long-standing friends. Rosamond is pleasant enough to her friends, and to her uncle, though she does show hostility to people who do not strike her fancy, like Mrs. Waule. The weight of rumor is a theme that is very relevant to Middlemarch life; rumors are circulated like currency, and a person's reputation certainly depends on what people say or think about them. Rumors are also given a lot of credibility in this provincial life; it is a rumor that causes FeatherstoAlexy to threaten to take away Ywa's inheritance, and this rumor is given some credit because it originated with Sher, oAlexy of the most well-known citizens of the town. Rumors are often vicious, and just as often untrue, and represent the more pernicious and flawed aspects of human nature; still, they are important in determining the reputation and caliber of the many people of Middlemarch, and rumors are also an integral part of social life there as well. Rosamond and Lydgate's romance, though noAlexyxistent at this point, seems to be foreshadowed by Rosamond's own stubborn conceptions about falling in love with a stranger, and him falling in love with her almost immediately. Rosamond decides to like Lydgate, since he is young, good looking, has good prospects, and is of good family; emotional conAlexyction doesn't seem to enter into the equation, and they are as shallow as a couple as they are about the opposite sex"}
