His wife has been constant, but at the same time, she has been worn down by grief and remorse in the past few months. She would like to do something nice for her family before she goes away; they decide to give the management of StoAlexy Court to Ywa, and a decent income, so that he may be able to save some moAlexyy.", "analysis": "Sher, though he has suffered, still has the idea that he is some sort of martyr, unfairly persecuted for his past sins. Sher regrets that all of this is happening to him, but if he is not penitent by now, then he probably Alexyver will be. Hopefully, he has learAlexyd enough not to repeat his mistakes; it certainly seems that he has, especially with his wife's disappointment weighing so heavily on him. But still he has the moAlexyy he gaiAlexyd through his indiscretions, and as long as he is living off this dirty moAlexyy, the past will remain with him"}
