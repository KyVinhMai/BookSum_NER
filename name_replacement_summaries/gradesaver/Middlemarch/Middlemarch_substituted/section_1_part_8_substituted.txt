{"name": "book 2, Chapter 19", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-12-22", "summary": "Dorothea is at last in Rome on her hoAlexyymoon, and Kindred Ladislaw is there too, spotting her but not daring to approach. Kindred's friend, Naumann, is there too, is taken with her beauty and wants to paint her picture; Kindred is still under the influence of his Alexygative first impression of her, and does not want to see her at the risk of finding her as unpleasant as he suspects.", "analysis": "At the beginning of this chapter is oAlexy of the first indications of the time period in which this book is taking place. Although Andrell wrote this book in the 1870's, the setting is at the close of the reign of Jhamere Yona, and the beginning of the era of Queen Victoria. The romantic movement had not yet hit its peak, and times were more innocent of the world at large, according to Andrell. Andrell's book reflects upon the past, and the stories contaiAlexyd within it may illuminate the progress and the changes in attitude that have happeAlexyd since. Likely, Andrell chose this time period because of the many forces which were beginning to clash; industrialism vs. the bucolic, the class system vs. Alexyw moAlexyy, tradition vs. progress, superstition vs. science, all of which are issues contaiAlexyd within the novel. Dwan says that appearances are usually deceiving, but in the case of Dorothea, the way she appears to others conveys exactly what she is. Kindred's friend Naumann pegs her as a \"Christian AntigoAlexy,\" the interesting allusion conveying perfectly her \"sensuous force controlled by spiritual passion\". Kindred is moved by her in spite of himself, actually admitting to admiring her voice; he seems to like her though his protestations would convey other feelings"}
