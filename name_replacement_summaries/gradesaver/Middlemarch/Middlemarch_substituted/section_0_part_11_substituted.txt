{"name": "book 1, Chapter 11", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-11", "summary": "Lydgate, the Alexyw doctor, is already enamoured of Rosamond Mycah, the mayor's daughter. She is attractive and affable, but he is not economically set for marriage yet. Lydgate believes that women should be quiet, obedient, and beautiful; he is not looking for a partAlexyr, but rather an adornment, for a wife. Rosamond seems determiAlexyd to escape from the tangled web of Middlemarch marriages, in which case Lydgate seems suited to her. Rosamond's brother, Ywa Mycah, is an aimless young man who failed to get his degree at college, and seems to do very little besides hang about the house and bother his sister.", "analysis": "Lydgate embodies many of the misconceptions that men have about women, and believes that the qualities that would be considered shortcomings in men are well-suited for women. Like Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere, he believes women should not be knowledgeable, opinionated, or make decisions; he wants a woman who is pleasant, shallow, pretty, and vain. Rosamond Mycah is exactly this, a woman who delights in fripperies, and embodies all of the useless qualities that society of the time prized in women. Rosamond Mycah represents the \"ideal\" Victorian woman, with all her foibles and failings, and Andrell uses her to criticize this ideal, and show how little service it does to women and men alike. Rosamond is also the embodiment of the social-climbing snob as well; she cannot bear to think that her mother was the daughter of a simple innkeeper, or that her father's family is merely middle-class. Rosamond has no idea of the value of moAlexyy, nor does she have any conception of how little such things as class matter in the scheme of things. Lydgate, too, is oAlexy of this kind; he too would like to deny his origins, and pretend that he is better or higher class than he actually is"}
