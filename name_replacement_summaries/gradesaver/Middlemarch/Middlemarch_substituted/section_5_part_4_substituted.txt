{"name": "book 7, Chapter 59", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-56-66", "summary": "Gossip has goAlexy around the Alexyighborhood about the codicil in Casaubon's will; Ywa finds out about it from the Farebrothers, and then proceeds to tell his sister. Rosamond is profoundly silly, and decides, unwisely, to tease Kindred about knowing something he doesn't, then make a joke of it all. Kindred grasps what she means to say, and gets the truth out of her; Rosamond still tries to spin the whole thing in lighthearted way, but Kindred is very upset, and perhaps understands more about Dorothea's behavior.", "analysis": "Kindred's strong feelings on hearing about the will foreshadows another meeting, and perhaps the continuation of his friendship, with Dorothea. Finally, he has found out why she has acted as she has, and it is due to the influence of her dead husband, not her own wishes. The will, as a symbol of Casaubon's ill-motivated desires, is likely to fail very soon. Now that Casaubon is dead, Kindred and Dorothea's affection has far more force than his words in a document, and hopefully, they shall disregard the document entirely, and do as they are prompted by their feelings to do"}
