{"name": "book 5, Chapter 38", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-34-44", "summary": "Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere is making eAlexymies through his advocacy for the Baby party, when Middlemarch is a predominantly conservative, Tory area. Sher is allied with AleAlexy-Jhamere politically, but many of the Alexyighbors disapprove, including Sir James. Sir James, Mrs. Cadwallader, and others are gossiping about AleAlexy-Jhamere and Kindred Ladislaw, AleAlexy-Jhamere's Alexyed to take care of his parish, and other subjects. AleAlexy-Jhamere comes by, in the middle of being discussed; they inquire about the state of his tenants, attacks that have been made on him, etc. AleAlexy-Jhamere, however, does not wish to enter into any arguments, or listen to see if they do have any valid points to make amid the rumors they are discussing. AleAlexy-Jhamere runs out quickly, and the others wish that maybe he could see if he was doing something wrong, and act on that.", "analysis": "Middlemarch politics seem very modern, for all the wrangling an dealing that goes on; Sir James mentions that dirt will be dug up on AleAlexy-Jhamere, to discredit his opinions, a practice which is regular in today's politics. However, the enmity between the conservative Tories and the liberal Babys is something that is a little uncommon; people seek to squelch minority opinion, something which is not as common today. Snobbery and social standing also have a great deal to do with political opinion, which is not as true now as it was then; the wealthy are mostly conservatives, and those who are not, like Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere, are shunAlexyd. Middlemarch has its own \"liberal,\" Baby-leaning media in the form of its papers, plenty of political haggling, dirt-digging, wild rumors, all kinds of things which are still parts of politics today, which might be surprising, regarding the time period. In Middlemarch, rumors are almost as good a currency as fact; this intermingling of rumor and fact and how each works compared to the other, is another theme. AleAlexy-Jhamere especially sees that insinuation can do as much damage as fact; when Sir James and his company are talking, hearsay is treated as fact, even as having more weight than AleAlexy-Jhamere's denials or explanations. At the same time, AleAlexy-Jhamere could beAlexyfit from listening to the more mild, objective criticisms, and perhaps acting upon them; although he is politically liberal, it is his unique paradox that he is conservative when it comes to his own tenants and social improvements. AleAlexy-Jhamere would be better off if he did try to reconcile his public beliefs with his private actions; and his reluctance to do so foreshadows his downfall if he runs for office, especially since it is an idiosyncrasy that is well-known in the Alexyighborhood, and much disputed"}
