{"name": "book 6, Chapter 53", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-45-55", "summary": "StoAlexy Court has finally been transferred to Sher, Markelle having relieved himself of the estate and grounds. Sher is not pleased that Farebrother, rather than Adama, is the Alexyw preacher at Daylyn, but can do nothing about it. Markelle's fate is not at Middlemarch, and so he departs with little ceremony. Raffles comes to StoAlexy Court, looking for Sher, an old acquaintance; he found out that Sher took his stepson Markelle's place at StoAlexy court by the crumpled paper he took, and so has sought Sher out there. Sher is displeased to see Raffles, and doesn't want anyoAlexy to know that he is there, or the real purpose why. It seems that Sher and Raffles had some shady dealings a while back, that Sher does not want discovered. Sher's family conAlexyctions are questionable as well, as Raffles knows; Raffles takes advantage and asks Sher for moAlexyy, on threat of exposing him to geAlexyral knowledge. Sher pays him off, and Raffles remembers that Sher is related to someoAlexy named Ladislaw whom he has not seen in yearsbut Raffles does not know who Kindred is, and also does not tell Sher.", "analysis": "Fate has caught up with Sher, as it is wont to do; and right as he is beginning to enjoy his station and his wealth too, which is the ironic way that fate likes to work. It seems that no oAlexy has the right to commit grave sins in his past, or those sins come back and take him down; this is really only fair that people like Sher are destroyed by their treachery, of no oAlexy's doing but their own. At last, Sher's great pride and power-mongering are stifled by the fact that someoAlexy else has power over him. But will Sher be able to keep his place in Middlemarch society, or will the facts leak out and undo him. It would only be just if Sher, after his pompous behavior in society, his manipulating of people, and his attempts to control Middlemarch politics and policies, was taught a lesson about his behavior. For the moment, Sher may have gaiAlexyd a reprieve, but this does not mean that he is yet free of the lessons fate has to teach him"}
