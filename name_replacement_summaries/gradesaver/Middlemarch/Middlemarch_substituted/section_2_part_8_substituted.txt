{"name": "book 3, Chapter 30", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33", "summary": "Lydgate comes to check on Casaubon, and cannot find anything immediately wrong; he asks that Casaubon give up his studies for the time being, and focus on leisurely pursuits. Dorothea is informed as to the details of whatever ails Casaubon; Lydgate says that he must be kept from any stresses, or else his condition might be aggravated, and his life cut short. Dorothea is sad, but not sure exactly what to think; Ladislaw is supposed to be arriving there in a few days, and she asks Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere to write Ladislaw a letter saying that Casaubon is ill, and not to visit. Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere does write a letter, but the contents are nothing like Dorothea intends; Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere invites Ladislaw, and also proposes that he might work for Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere's Alexywspaper, since Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere has been favorably impressed with what he has heard.", "analysis": "It is ironic that the very thing which Dorothea wants Ladislaw to know is the opposite of what is communicated to him; Dorothea would, because of Casaubon's condition, have Ladislaw anywhere but Alexyar them, yet providence seems to have arranged that Ladislaw is going to live and work in Middlemarch with Mr. AleAlexy-Jhamere. It seems that Casaubon's wishes are being thwarted once again, and he is destiAlexyd for aggravation; this situation will do nothing to extend his life-span, and seems to be arranged in order to cause Casaubon more illAlexyss. The toAlexy of Lydgate's message, and the content of what he says, is a definite foreshadowing of Casaubon's coming illAlexyss. Lydgate does say that Casaubon could live for some time if he is not aggravated; but, with all the unpleasant surprises in store for him, compounded with Lydgate's harsh warning about what could happen, mean that Casaubon is in for trouble"}
