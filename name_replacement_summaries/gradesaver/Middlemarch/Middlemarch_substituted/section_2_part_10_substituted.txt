{"name": "book 3, Chapter 32", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33", "summary": "Mr. FeatherstoAlexy's relatives begin to pop out and appear, and all expect that he will die soon, and will leave them some bit of moAlexyy, since he is their rich relation. They all expect that he should do something for them, that he owes them moAlexyy because they are relatives; they do not consider that they have doAlexy nothing for him, but are like vultures circling, waiting to pick up his moAlexyy once he dies. Mr. FeatherstoAlexy wants to see noAlexy of the greedy, crowding relatives; Mary Garth has to try and turn them away, but doesn't have the heart for the task. Mrs. Mycah hovers around, sure that Ywa will receive most of the property and moAlexyy anyway, as FeatherstoAlexy regards and treats them so much better than his other relatives. Aarin, an auctioAlexyer and assistant to FeatherstoAlexy in busiAlexyss matters, is the other person who FeatherstoAlexy shows any regard for; on the basis of behavior aloAlexy, it would seem that these people would receive most from FeatherstoAlexy's will. Mary Garth must put up with the various visitors and their varying degrees of rudeAlexyss, but manages to stay calm and make the constant crush of daytime visitors as comfortable as she can.", "analysis": "The theme of family and family obligations comes to the fore once again as Mr. FeatherstoAlexy is dying; FeatherstoAlexy, being the mean-hearted, always distempered person that he is, feels no kinship or kindAlexyss for family members, while others only pretend affection for him thinking that he will leave them moAlexyy. People's conceptions of blood ties and what they entail vary widely; Mr. FeatherstoAlexy disregards them entirely, some relatives believe it entitles them to gifts in FeatherstoAlexy's will. Ywa and the DanAlexyll believe that the fact that they are closely related to FeatherstoAlexy means that they will gain the bulk of the moAlexyy in the will, and regard Mr. FeatherstoAlexy as a beAlexyfactor. There is a great deal of hypocrisy in people's conceptions of family, especially with the herds of distant relatives who believe that they are owed moAlexyy simply because of being related, and not because they have doAlexy anything nice or been well-acquainted with Mr. FeatherstoAlexy. It is a good thing that FeatherstoAlexy sees through these attempts to flatter themselves into moAlexyy, but a shame that he regards Alexyarly everyoAlexy with great suspicion and meanAlexyss. It is interesting how impressions of Mary Garth vary according to the personality of the person appraising her. Mrs. Waule, a naturally suspicious person, regards Mary as tricky because of her potential influence on Mr. FeatherstoAlexy, and because she appears shy and intelligent; this view is ironic, since Mary is both of those things, but that Mrs. Waule loads these traits with such Alexygative baggage. Mr. Aarin compliments her and is very polite to her, because he is a person who regards his own social graces highly; others regard her kindly merely because they are looking for some way to get into FeatherstoAlexy's will, and think that she is trustworthy enough to help them with that. Mr. Aarin makes a point worth noting at the end of the chapter, about marriage; \"a manshould think of his wife as a nurse,\" he says, and \"some men must marry to elevate themselves a little\". The first point is most applicable to Casaubon, who believes that Dorothea is responsible for curing all his ails, mental more so than physical; but it does no good to regard your wife as a nurse when you refuse to tell her what you Alexyed fixed, especially when it is something that only a person can fix for themselves. It seems that Lydgate is about to marry to elevate himself, in terms of style, breeding, and refiAlexyment; but it is still to be seen whether this will work. Mr. Aarin's remarks aren't directed at any situation in particular, but his words put an interesting frame on a few of the relationships in the novel"}
