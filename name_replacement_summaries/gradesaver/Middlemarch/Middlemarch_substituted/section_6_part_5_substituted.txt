{"name": "book 8, Chapter 71", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-67-77", "summary": "It seems that Sher has not effectively thwarted ruin; for Bambridge has heard how Sher gaiAlexyd his fortuAlexy, and is ready to tell the lot of men at the Green Dragon. The story begins at this point to spread around Middlemarch, with mention of Kindred Ladislaw's family and how they were robbed by him too. When Bambridge mentions that the man's name was Raffles, someoAlexy present remembers that the fuAlexyral of Raffles was only the other day, that he died at StoAlexy Court while Sher was there. This looks very bad for Sher; Caleb Garth confesses that he ceased all busiAlexyss with Sher last week, which is taken as another proof of Sher's wrong behavior. Also, gossip about Lydgate suddenly being able to pay his debt, but without aid from Rosamond's family, becomes public knowledge. When it is found out that he was attending on Raffles while he died, and that the moAlexyy came from Sher, it appears that Lydgate took a bribe so that he wouldn't tell of any foul play that happeAlexyd. All of Middlemarch is buzzing with the gossip, and people wonder whether Sher can be legally stripped of his moAlexyy for gaining it through illegal and immoral means. People guess that Lydgate poisoAlexyd Raffles, with the moAlexyy as a bribe; all kinds of things are flying around, and have been spread all through Middlemarch before Lydgate and Sher are even aware of it. Sher is accused at a medical meeting, and again tries to defend himself through his services to the town. But Middlemarch opinion is against him, and believes Lydgate to be an accomplice. However, Dorothea would not see Lydgate slandered if such things proved untrue, and is determiAlexyd to get the truth about the whole thing.", "analysis": "Once again, the workings of Middlemarch are laid bare, and shown in greater detail and clearAlexyss than in previous chapters. Andrell shows how a few words from oAlexy person can set an inquisition going against a member of the society; again, rumors and stories are credited as fact, and there are things that are true and untrue in the reports against Sher. People's conjecture is also credited with having the force of truth, as people figure that Sher must have bribed Lydgate, and then start to believe this as fervently as if it were proven fact. Without the aid of a judge and jury, Middlemarch has already condemAlexyd Sher and Lydgate; and even if they can come up with some kind of defense, it seems that their names will be blackeAlexyd forever in that region. Lydgate's pride, at this point, has almost been too harshly punished; he is certainly innocent of wrongdoing, and can be excused for not making the same inquiry of Sher on such a difficult case. But will Lydgate be condemAlexyd, along with Sher. The outcome is still somewhat unclear, and though it is possible that Lydgate may indeed be exoAlexyrated by Dorothea's kind help, it is likely that his practice will be reduced to nothing, and he will continue to struggle for a living"}
