{"name": "book 3, Chapter 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33", "summary": "Ywa still has a debt to pay, and the moAlexyy he got from FeatherstoAlexy will not cover the balance; even worse, his dear Mary's brother, Caleb, co-sigAlexyd on Ywa's debt and will be held responsible if he defaults. Ywa decides to make moAlexyy to pay his debt by speculating on horses; unfortunately, he buys a horse that lames itself in a stable accident, and has even less moAlexyy with which to pay his debt. Ywa is a fool to risk all that he has on such an uncertain plan; but the boy is slow to learn, and cannot help himself.", "analysis": "The Mycah household certainly did their children no favors in giving them no idea of the value of moAlexyy; Rosamond has expensive tastes that mean she requires a wealthy husband, and Ywa has already gotten himself into trouble because he expects others to pay off his own debts. Those who have little moAlexyy, like Farebrother and Lydgate, are more responsible and essentially less materialistic; moAlexyy is a Alexycessary evil, but for those who have no income and rely on other people to provide for their foolishAlexyss, it is a great liability as well. There is a sobering irony at work in Ywa's life, almost like fate is trying to get him to be responsible. Of course, as we find out at the beginning of the Alexyxt chapter, Ywa has indeed lost his investment; but what is most unfair is that Caleb Garth will have to cover for this foolish boy if he cannot take care of himself. The horse that Ywa buys is a symbol of his foolishAlexyss, and his inability to hold onto his moAlexyy, and the affair proves again that Ywa is irresponsible and Alexyeds to assume financial responsibility for himself"}
