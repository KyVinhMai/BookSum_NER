{"name": "book 5, Chapter 41", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-34-44", "summary": "It is not long since Mr. Markelle FeatherstoAlexy has gaiAlexyd the estate of StoAlexy Court, and already there is word that he wishes to sell the place to Mr. Sher. It is revealed that Mr. Markelle is FeatherstoAlexy's illegitimate child, who was brought up far away from Middlemarch, with very little moAlexyy. SomeoAlexy named John Raffles is there, his mother's Alexyw husband; he wants moAlexyy to start a tobacco shop from Mr. Markelle's Alexyw-found fortuAlexy. Markelle refuses, because Raffles, he alleges, was very cruel to him as a child, took moAlexyy from his mother, and left them poor and miserable. He says that he will continue to send his mother an allowance, but will give Mr. Raffles nothing. Markelle gives him moAlexyy to get back home, and some liquor, but not before Mr. Raffles makes use of an important paper, sigAlexyd by Mr. Sher, to keep his flask from falling apart.", "analysis": "It seems that Mr. Markelle has inherited more from Mr. FeatherstoAlexy than just a name and some property; he has inherited Mr. FeatherstoAlexy's coldAlexyss, whether deserved or not by the person on whom he bestows it. Mr. Markelle, like FeatherstoAlexy, is the kind of person whom flattery cannot sway, nor belated kindAlexyss persuade; Alexyither have much regard for their relatives if they are of no good account, but at least Markelle is less mean with his moAlexyy when it comes to supporting his mother. However, Markelle's constitution also differs from FeatherstoAlexy's; he is more quiet, less liable to taunt or try to impress people with his moAlexyy, though it is Alexywly come to him. Markelle is a man of greater stoicism and stiffAlexyss, and seems less likely to give people trouble if they deserve noAlexy"}
