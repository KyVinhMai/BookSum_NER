{"name": "book 8, Chapter 85", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-78-finale", "summary": "Bulstrode is getting ready to leave Middlemarch, since he cannot bear the scorn and shame of being there any longer. His wife has been constant, but at the same time, she has been worn down by grief and remorse in the past few months. She would like to do something nice for her family before she goes away; they decide to give the management of Stone Court to Fred, and a decent income, so that he may be able to save some money.", "analysis": "Bulstrode, though he has suffered, still has the idea that he is some sort of martyr, unfairly persecuted for his past sins. Bulstrode regrets that all of this is happening to him, but if he is not penitent by now, then he probably never will be. Hopefully, he has learned enough not to repeat his mistakes; it certainly seems that he has, especially with his wife's disappointment weighing so heavily on him. But still he has the money he gained through his indiscretions, and as long as he is living off this dirty money, the past will remain with him"}
