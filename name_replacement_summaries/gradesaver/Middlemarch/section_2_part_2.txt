{"name": "book 3, Chapter 24", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33", "summary": "Fred finally feels very sorry about his debt, and the fact that he has only fifty pounds and five days to pay up. Fred is most sorry because Mary's father is going to have to pay, and he feels this will jeopardize his chances with Mary. Fred goes to the Garth household to tell Caleb Garth, whose wife is very fond of Fred, but probably will not be after he tells her. Mrs. Garth is teaching her children their lessons in the kitchen, and Fred sits down and tells her and Mr. Garth the news. Mrs. Garth will have to give up the money she was saving to send her son to school; Fred feels terrible, as he should, knowing that his irresponsibility is costing them so much. Mr. Garth knows then that he was a fool to trust Fred, and they believe that there is little chance Mary will regard him so highly when she finds out.", "analysis": "The theme of the importance of money resurfaces again, as the Garths find themselves hard-pressed to pay for their trust in Fred. Although the Garths work very hard, they have little money because Mr. Garth does not like to charge much, if anything, for his work. However, in this case, money does not mean happiness; the Garths are very happy, certainly much happier than people like Dorothea and Casaubon who have plenty of money. How ironic that responsible, hard-working people are forced to pay the debt of another person. In comparison with the Garths, Fred appears even more irresponsible, flighty, and lazy; in order to win Mary's affection, he will certainly have to work very, very hard. It is a good thing for Fred that he is very sorry for what he has done; perhaps it will teach him some lessons in responsibility, and he will be able to win back Mary's regard by working hard and repaying his debt to her family"}
