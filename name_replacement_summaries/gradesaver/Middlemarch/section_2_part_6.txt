{"name": "book 3, Chapter 28", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33", "summary": "Dorothea arrives at Lowick with her husband in January, after their honeymoon. Dorothea, who had been so dejected during their honeymoon, feels revived by being home, in familiar surroundings. However, she is still haunted by the knowledge that her vision of marriage is yet unfulfilled, and the depressing atmosphere of Lowick. Her sister Celia finally arrives, brightening up the place with her presence; Celia tells Dorothea of her engagement to Sir James, and Dorothea is very happy for her sister.", "analysis": "The many images of liveliness in Dorothea's appearance convey her change of heart, how she feels renewed and hopeful at her future again; the irony of these feelings is how false they are, and how they do nothing to prepare her for what she will have to endure. Perhaps Dorothea is trying to falsely reassure herself that everything will be alright, now that she is in Middlemarch again; but the same problems that dogged her in Rome have not gone away so easily, and she will find her married life very difficult. The \"ghostly stag\" that appears in her room is a symbol of Dorothea's married life; both are trapped, flattened into decoration, and live in the same \"chill, colorless, narrowed landscape\". \"Each remembered thing in the room was disenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency,\" to Dorothea; Eliot's metaphor conveys Dorothea's despair, and the lack of color in her life. In her new situation, Dorothea feels that there must be parallels between her and Julia, Will Ladislaw's grandmother, who was doomed by a bad marriage. She finally sees that her match was also badly made, and that the same consequences and unhappiness might be in store for her"}
