{"name": "book 7, Chapter 58", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-56-66", "summary": "She and Lydgate get a visit from his cousin, Captain Lydgate, which thrills Rosamond; Lydgate thinks his cousin foppish and stupid, and would rather him leave. Rosamond gets a little upset with Lydgate on this issue, though Lydgate insists he is not the only one who dislikes his cousin. Rosamond's baby is born premature because of an accident on a horse, and dies soon after; she would not have been riding if she had listened to her husband's advice, but stubbornly refused to listen to him. Lydgate is also troubled by his growing debt, especially since it was incurred buying things which he, though perhaps not Rosamond, could have done without. Lydgate finally has to put up the furniture of the house as security against his debt; he tries to speak to Rosamond about keeping expenses down and buying less expensive things, but he is too soft-hearted to really tell her anything. Rosamond proves to be very silly and naive, and even thinks to herself that she would not have married Lydgate if she knew he was to have little money, and that she could not have lived as she was used to. Rosamond decides to go and ask her father for money, against Lydgate's wishes; Lydgate is saddened that this issue will come up again and again, and he will have to struggle to keep Rosamond from wasting too much money.", "analysis": "Rosamond's favor for Captain Lydgate is based solely on her vanity. He flatters her, compliments her, and pays her a great deal of attention, which her husband seems not to do anymore; he fulfills Rosamond's need to be frequently attended to, increasing her contentment. Also, the fact that he is of higher rank and title means that Rosamond likes him even more for it; she is snobbishly proud of being visited by someone of higher rank than anyone she knows in Middlemarch. She still thrills in her husband's high connections and good birth, which also please her vain character. What made Rosamond love Lydgate in the first place was how he sated her vanity with flirtations, attentions, and compliments; but since this courtship behavior is over, Rosamond might begin to feel that she doesn't care so much for him anymore, or that something is lacking in the union. The other pillar of the union, Lydgate's pride, is also crumbling fast. He expected Rosamond to lavish her attentions and graces on him at all time, though that too was her courtship, and not her everyday, behavior. He wants to feel that his wife honors and loves him above all, but her show of pleasantness toward Captain Lydgate, coupled with her less pleasant behavior toward her husband, is quickly deflating his pride. Also, the fact that she is making decisions for herself which are contrary to her husband's wishes, as when she goes horseback riding without his permission, is lessening his pride because he sees that he is not the real leader of the household that he suspected he would be. Once these two can no longer feed their flaws through each other's attentions and presence, the union will have nothing left on which to stand. Mrs. Bulstrode's predictions about the union are coming true; Rosamond's expensive tastes have gotten Lydgate into trouble, and he does not know how to get her to stop. Lydgate is about as good with money as Fred is, but unlike Fred, he will not stoop to asking anyone's help with the matter. Lydgate had let Rosamond do as she wished with the household, trusting that she would do things sensibly, with an eye for their situation; however, Lydgate finds that Rosamond is an exceedingly impractical creature in more than one sense, which causes him great pain. At the same time, pride causes him to try and protect her from what is happening, and not to disappoint her too much in her new living. Rosamond and her brother Fred are much alike in the ways they view money; money is something that they take for granted that they have, and they believe they should be able to afford anything they wish. Money is a major theme, and decisive element, in both of their stories, but Fred is forced to learn his errors, and Rosamond is not. Fred, as a man, has to try and make his own living, and is also forced to realize the consequences of his dependence on others to pay his debts. However, Rosamond does not learn, because she is not a man; her husband makes the living, not her, and she has no conception of the value of money. Rosamond needs to see that her preferred way of living is getting her husband into deep debt, rather than be protected from her foolishness. But, Lydgate's pride, and his love for his ornamental bride, keep him from teaching her a very necessary lesson. Lydgate chose to marry Rosamond because she was charming, beautiful, knew the appropriate arts and music, and had social graces; Rosamond is all the things that a proper young lady should be, and everything that society tries to force women to be. But, women who are near to the ideal, like Rosamond is, also have no capacity for anything practical or serious; it is as if society wants them to be helpless, and wants to keep them from being complete human beings. Lydgate realizes that he might have been mistaken in choosing her, because the ideal in society is not necessarily the ideal for him. He thinks of Dorothea, who, though unconventional, would be intelligent, sensitive, and practical enough to be a good wife to a man like him. Rosamond too married Lydgate because he was an idealattentive, intelligent, attractive, etc. But though Rosamond and Lydgate are ideal models in many ways, this doesn't mean that they have any of the qualities necessary to make a life together. In searching out society's ideal, rather than someone who was a good fit for them personally, they have condemned themselves to a poor marriage, and a great deal of disappointment throughout their lives"}
