{"name": "book 3, Chapter 23", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33", "summary": "Fred still has a debt to pay, and the money he got from Featherstone will not cover the balance; even worse, his dear Mary's brother, Caleb, co-signed on Fred's debt and will be held responsible if he defaults. Fred decides to make money to pay his debt by speculating on horses; unfortunately, he buys a horse that lames itself in a stable accident, and has even less money with which to pay his debt. Fred is a fool to risk all that he has on such an uncertain plan; but the boy is slow to learn, and cannot help himself.", "analysis": "The Vincy household certainly did their children no favors in giving them no idea of the value of money; Rosamond has expensive tastes that mean she requires a wealthy husband, and Fred has already gotten himself into trouble because he expects others to pay off his own debts. Those who have little money, like Farebrother and Lydgate, are more responsible and essentially less materialistic; money is a necessary evil, but for those who have no income and rely on other people to provide for their foolishness, it is a great liability as well. There is a sobering irony at work in Fred's life, almost like fate is trying to get him to be responsible. Of course, as we find out at the beginning of the next chapter, Fred has indeed lost his investment; but what is most unfair is that Caleb Garth will have to cover for this foolish boy if he cannot take care of himself. The horse that Fred buys is a symbol of his foolishness, and his inability to hold onto his money, and the affair proves again that Fred is irresponsible and needs to assume financial responsibility for himself"}
