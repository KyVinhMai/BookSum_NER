{"name": "book 7, Chapter 65", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-56-66", "summary": "Lydgate finds out, from a letter written by his uncle Godwin, that Rosamond wrote him for money behind his back. Lydgate is enraged that Rosamond would do such a thing, and also because he was about to go to see his uncle, and may have gotten some money, rather than a complete denial. However, when Lydgate gets angry at her for deceiving him and playing him false, she does what she always doeslook pretty, shed a tear, and act with composure. Lydgate is weakened by this, meaning that he will always be in debt, and will allow his wife to be selfish, stupid, and vain, even if it means their financial ruin. Rosamond hits new lows of shallowness when she proclaims that she would rather have died in childbirth than have to give up her house and furniture.", "analysis": "Again, Rosamond displays the ironic view that she is to blame for nothing, simply because she has never lost her composure, and always expresses herself with the proper calmness. Rosamond is again shown as a creature of complete naivete, stupidity, and destructive stubbornness; why Lydgate prefers the desperation of financial ruin to correcting his wife's faults and thus healing the marriage, is an odd paradox which cannot be answered. Lydgate was very foolish in choosing Rosamond as a wife; and Rosamond has found someone she can manipulate and control completely, in Lydgate. Indeed, when she raves on, in a very ridiculous, self-important tone, about how he is making her life difficult, how he is responsible for their hardship, it is obvious that she is more to blame for the situation than anybody. However, Lydgate remains completely taken in, which means that he will soon be in a great deal of trouble, and the marriage will be in an even worse state than before"}
