{"name": "book 7, Chapter 64", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-56-66", "summary": "Lydgate's money situation is certainly not getting any better, and Rosamond is very sour and inconsiderate whenever he mentions cutting down household expenses. He begins to resent the fact that she will not learn that they only have a limited amount of money, and cannot spend any more; she pouts like a sullen child, and acts like he has all the money in the world, he is only too mean to spend it on her. He decides that they should sell the house and the furniture, and move somewhere cheaper to live; Rosamond, of course, takes badly to this suggestion. Ned Plymdale is to be married, and Ned's mother rubs in that Ned has a lot more money than Lydgate, meaning that Rosamond was wrong to turn him down. Rosamond decides to handle matters herself; she makes sure that the house cannot be sold to Ned Plymdale as her husband wishes, and writes his relatives for money without telling him. She tells her husband that she stopped the sale of the house, but not about the letters; Lydgate realizes that she will be unhappy if they move, and dreads that. He decides to apply to his rich uncle for money, not knowing that his wife has already done so.", "analysis": "One of Lydgate's problems is that he believes that life is more than everyday struggles, and attempting to make ends meet. His vision is that his life should be spent in curing diseases, making medical advances, and taking notable steps forward in his practice. Instead, he is greeted by the same backward patients, has to beg for balances to be paid in a timely manner, and worry ceaselessly about money, an issue on which his wife is less than sympathetic. Lydgate truly resents the issue of money because it is keeping him from what he thinks life is; life to him isn't worrying that your furniture will be taken if you default on a debt, or endlessly lecturing your wife about the need to cut costs. These ideas about life are part of the theme of greatness in achievement running throughout Lydgate's life, that Lydgate seems very unwilling to abandon. The money problems that Lydgate and Rosamond are experiencing mark the start of the end of their relationship. Money is the one factor that can effectively set Rosamond's vanity and Lydgate's pride at odds with each other, thus hurting the two pillars of the relationship. Lydgate becomes almost like a thing, a strange symbol to Dorothea; he represents how her world is out of the order she wishes it to be in, and thinks that if she can just say the right thing, it will all be fine again. Lydgate, to her, is the originator and the source of all their money problems, a view that is both filled with irony, and not totally correct; he should work harder, he should ask his relatives for loans, according to her. Rosamond has never had to take responsibility for anything in her life, and if Lydgate tries to make her do so, he will become a symbol of even greater unpleasantness to her. Eliot compares their marriage to a \"delicate crystal,\" with that metaphor conveying the fragility, and marred beauty, of the relationship. Rosamond begins to act out of bitterness and anger toward her husband; ironically, it is his behavior which becomes inexcusable, though hers is all the more reprehensible. Her husband cares for her, though there are certain unpleasant things which must be done; Rosamond seems not to care for Lydgate one bit, as she tries to keep the house from being sold, and then defies his explicitly stated wishes. A more caring person would at least consult their spouse, and try to work out of the situation together; Rosamond's position is one of ruthless sabotage, of her husband's plans, and his pride as well. Rosamond's character is a good example of an appearance vs. reality theme at work in the book, and of the treachery that can come from greed and vanity. Both Rosamond and Lydgate are finding out the terrible truth, that pleasant moments and occasional courtship have nothing to do with living together from day to day. Rosamond basically says to Lydgate that she married him because she imagined they would live well, with plenty of money, and be very happy that way. She dislikes almost every personal aspect of him; he is not nearly so harsh, though sometimes he can hardly stand the pressure she puts on him"}
