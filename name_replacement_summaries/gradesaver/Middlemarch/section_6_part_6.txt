{"name": "book 8, Chapter 72", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-67-77", "summary": "Dorothea is set on proving Lydgate innocent, though this may prove difficult. Farebrother would certainly like to help, but he knows from the alteration and desperation in Lydgate's character of late, that is it completely likely that Lydgate did take the bribe, to save himself. Farebrother does not blame Lydgate, but at the same time knows how good people may be tempted, and fail. Sir James is definitely against Dorothea having anything to do with this issue; but Dorothea is still determined to do a good turn for Lydgate, especially after he helped her so much when her husband died. Dorothea is not the sort of person to allow a friend to be wronged, unless he is really guilty of what he is accused of.", "analysis": "Here, gender relations are at work, as Dorothea struggles to get support for her plan. Gender roles are the main consideration in the men's refusal to let Dorothea go to Lydgate's aid; as a woman, she is necessarily too weak minded and unwise to be entrusted with such a great undertaking, which might have undesirable consequences. It is unfair that Dorothea's noble plan is dismissed outright, because of her gender and the misconceptions of women that help to sabotage her. This is one of the defining themes, and trials of Dorothea's life; to be herself, and do what she wishes, despite the limitations and ideas that belie her intelligence and strength as a woman. Celia may have a more conventional view, that women must submit to men unless they know that the men are wrong, but it is necessary for Dorothea to find her own ways, or risk losing herself as she did when she was married to Casaubon"}
